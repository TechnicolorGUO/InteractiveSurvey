0. Business Process Management Systems in Organizational Contexts  

# 1. Introduction  

Business Process Management (BPM) is widely defined as a systematic approach or discipline focused on managing, improving, and optimizing an organization's business processes [26,41,42]. These processes are understood as a series of activities and tasks designed to achieve a specific organizational goal [41,42]. BPM encompasses various activities throughout a process lifecycle, including analysis, modeling, design, implementation, monitoring, control, and continuous optimization [25,26,27,42]. A core tenet of BPM is the prioritization of business processes as critical organizational assets, shifting from traditional function-driven management to a process-driven approach [10,11]. This strategic focus aims to align all organizational elements to enhance operational performance, improve efficiency, reduce errors, and ensure consistency across activities [6,11].​  

Complementary to BPM as a discipline is the Business Process Management System (BPMS), which is a software platform designed to manage and optimize these organizational processes [8,10]. BPMS provides tools and features for the entire process lifecycle, enabling standardized modeling, automated execution, and continuous optimization [8,10]. These systems automate workflows, aggregate and analyze data, and facilitate collaboration between IT and business users to enhance decision-making and make better use of IT resources [21,24].

While BPM is the overarching strategy and discipline, BPMS represents the technological realization of BPM principles, often combining workflow management software with knowledge and other technologies like business intelligence, ERP, and SOA [3].​  

The increasing attention given to business processes by organizations reflects the recognition of processes as the basic unit of business value [19]. This focus is driven by the need to streamline operations, consolidate organizations, and achieve cost savings [19]. The prevalence of BPM and BPMS is underscored by significant market growth; the business process management market was expected to reach ​13.5billionby2021[14]andfurtherprojectedtoreach 23.04 billion by 2025 [21]. This growth indicates the widespread adoption across various industries, including banking, healthcare, manufacturing, IT, and telecommunications [38]. Senior executives increasingly view process optimization as essential for competitiveness and business survival [14].​  

The importance of BPM systems for enhancing organizational performance is widely acknowledged. By automating manual tasks and streamlining operations, BPMS contributes significantly to improved efficiency and productivity [24,25]. BPM also enhances organizational effectiveness, agility, and responsiveness, enabling companies to adapt quickly to market dynamics and competitive pressures [23,25,26]. Achieving operational excellence, enhancing customer satisfaction, and  

staying competitive are key objectives driving the adoption of BPM principles and systems [23,42]. For instance, adopting a systemic BPM strategy can create distinct competitive advantages and boost project success rates significantly [29].  

Despite the considerable promise of BPM, challenges exist in fully realizing its potential benefits, such as saving money, saving time, and adding value [19]. Organizations may face difficulties in meeting initial requirements, such as clearly outlining business drivers and target processes, and developing clear deployment strategies [27]. Furthermore, the practical application of emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) within BPM, particularly the vision for Large Process Models (LPMs), highlights a gap between the correlation power of new models and the need for reliable, trustworthy, and actionable intelligence in real-world BPM implementations [18].  

This survey aims to consolidate the understanding of Business Process Management Systems and their critical role within organizational contexts [43]. It delves into the definition, core functionalities, and motivations behind deploying BPM systems, providing a comprehensive overview of the field. The scope of this survey focuses on synthesizing existing research to provide a structured understanding of BPM and BPMS adoption, implementation, and impact in various organizational settings. By analyzing and synthesizing insights from diverse perspectives, this survey contributes to the field by bridging potential gaps in fragmented knowledge and offering a consolidated reference for researchers and practitioners navigating the complexities of implementing and leveraging BPM systems for enhanced organizational performance [43]. The problem addressed by this survey is the need for a comprehensive, synthesized overview of BPM and BPMS within organizational contexts, addressing definitions, evolution, market significance, drivers, benefits, and highlighting relevant research gaps and challenges that warrant further investigation.​  

# 2. Core Concepts and Evolution of Business Process Management (BPM)  

Business Process Management (BPM) represents a foundational concept within organizational science, focusing on the systematic approach to managing business processes to achieve strategic objectives. Definitions of BPM exhibit common themes while also highlighting specific nuances. It is broadly defined as a systemic methodology for capturing, designing, executing, documenting, measuring, monitoring, and controlling both automated and non-automated processes to align with organizational goals and strategies [29]. BPM treats business processes as critical assets contributing directly to enterprise performance, driving operational excellence and agility [1]. While historically process management disciplines emphasized efficiency, contemporary views of BPM increasingly underscore the importance of process visibility, accountability, and adaptability as key measures of operational excellence [1]. Some perspectives also highlight BPM as a science of enterprise management focusing specifically on business processes, noting its distinction by separating processes from their underlying data [43]. This comprehensive approach embraces the conscious and continuous definition improvement, innovation, and maintenance of end-to-end processes, often enabled by technology [29].  

![](images/6858d1583fb0b876173262a62b295b6bb667c4b6dd5da33a7814ac9bb4d3c7f5.jpg)  

BPM can be understood through three interrelated perspectives: as a management approach, a methodology, and a technology [27,43]. As a management approach, BPM advocates for the entire organizational management structure— including strategy formulation, goal setting, controlling, and planning—to be fundamentally based on its core business processes [27]. As a methodology, it encompasses methods, techniques, and tools designed to support the complete lifecycle of business processes, from design and enactment to management and analysis [27]. Technology, often in the form of Business Process Management Systems (BPMS), provides the necessary infrastructure and tools to support these methodologies and the overall management approach, enabling the automation and monitoring of processes [19,27].  

Historically, organizations primarily adopted a "function-oriented" approach to management, where structure and operations were organized around functional departments. However, the limitations of this perspective became apparent as the business landscape grew more complex, hindering organizational performance and adaptability [27]. This recognition spurred a shift towards a "process-oriented" vision, emphasizing end-to-end workflows that deliver value to the customer [19,27]. This paradigm shift was significantly influenced by concepts like Business Process Re-Engineering (BPR), proposed by Hammer and Champy (1993), which advocated for the radical redesign of processes [27]. Other practices such as Davenport’s “Process Innovation” (1993), Total Quality Management (TQM), Six Sigma, Lean Management, and Timebased Management further reinforced the process-oriented perspective [27]. Unlike the sometimes radical changes sought by BPR, BPM is often viewed as a continuous process of management, focusing on ongoing analysis and design rather than one-time transformative changes [3]. BPM offers distinct advantages over functionally oriented approaches by fostering greater efficiency and effectiveness through continuous process improvement, ultimately aiming for enhanced customer satisfaction, product quality, faster delivery, and reduced time-to-market [11]. This process-centric view allows organizations to optimize workflows, eliminate redundancies and bottlenecks, and reduce waste, thereby achieving greater overall performance and development [11,28].  

The evolution of BPM has been significantly shaped by technological advancements. Early stages in the 1990s primarily focused on basic process modeling and automation tools to ensure efficient workflows through standardization [6]. The advent of technologies such as XML, Web services, component-based development, and message-oriented middleware further fueled interest, enabling the development of BPMS capable of fine-grained system and data integration necessary for process automation [19]. This led to the iBPM (Intelligent BPM) stage, integrating with enterprise systems like ERP and CRM, incorporating real-time monitoring, dynamic adjustment, and leveraging Business Intelligence (BI) for preliminary decision support [6]. By around 2020, BPM practices further segmented into distinct areas: Enterprise Business Process Analysis (EBPA), Business Process Automation (BPA), and Process Mining (PM), forming a closed-loop management system [6]. The most recent evolution is driven by breakthroughs in AI, particularly large language models, propelling BPM into an "AI-Empowered Stage". This stage sees AI providing deep support for data processing, predictive analysis, intelligent decision-making, and advanced process optimization, leading towards "Agentic Workflow" and a fundamental shift from "rule-driven" to "cognitive evolution" in process management [6,18]. AI-augmented BPM aims to integrate symbolic and sub-symbolic AI methods to create processes that are adaptable, proactive, explainable, and context-sensitive [18]. Process intelligence, a data-driven approach integrating steps like discovery, analysis, monitoring, prediction, and simulation, further empowers businesses to understand and transform workflows through informed decisions and intelligent automation [30].​  

Within the broader scope of BPM, several related concepts focus specifically on leveraging technology for automation. Process Automation is the automatic orchestration of business processes, often via a workflow engine, and is considered a key component of digital transformation [29]. It primarily relies on technology to automate repetitive tasks for smoother process execution, aiming to reduce costs, improve productivity, and enhance efficiency and customer experience [25,29]. Business Process Automation (BPA) is a technology-enabled approach focusing on automating activities or services that accomplish a specific function or workflow [3,29]. BPA is essentially the practice of automating manual processes [29]. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a specific type of process automation that utilizes software robots or bots, often incorporating AI, to automate typically manual, repetitive daily tasks by interacting with digital systems as a human would [3,25]. The core idea behind RPA is to relieve human workers from tedious activities, allowing them to focus on higher-value contributions [25]. The distinctions lie in their scope and focus: BPM is a holistic organizational discipline concerned with analyzing, designing, executing, monitoring, and optimizing all business processes, whether manual or automated, aligning them with strategic goals [25,29]. BPA is focused on using technology to automate processes to achieve efficiency, agility, and compliance [3,29]. RPA is a tool or technique within process automation that specifically mimics human actions on digital interfaces for repetitive tasks [25].

These concepts are complementary; BPA is often considered vital for a successful BPM strategy by providing the necessary automation layer [29], and RPA can be deployed to automate specific steps or tasks within a larger process governed by BPM [25]. Process automation, in general, serves as a technological enabler for BPM, allowing for the automated execution of designed and optimized processes [29].  

# 3. Business Process Management Systems (BPMS): Architecture, Components, and Features  

Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) represent a class of software designed to support the systematic management of organizational processes throughout their lifecycle, from design and execution to monitoring and optimization [8,25]. Modern BPMS are often characterized by architectures built upon core interconnected components, enabling enterprises to integrate diverse processes and systems for coordinated operations and decision-making [9,22]. The contemporary interest in BPMS has been significantly fueled by innovations in foundational technologies such as XML, Web services, and component-based development, which facilitate system interoperability and modular design [19].  

![](images/3e741ba879a2635aebd12bbe250f5d452f992b828893983db6d2eef9418780c2.jpg)  

The architecture of a BPMS typically comprises several key components. The process modeling tool provides a graphical interface for designing and defining business processes, including elements, activities, and decision points, often supporting standards like BPMN 2.0 [8,10]. Visual modeling tools, sometimes integrated into low-code platforms, simplify the representation of complex workflows with features like rich process nodes and condition judgment [34]. Following process design, the process execution engine is central to automating workflows, translating defined models into executable steps, managing task allocation, coordinating participants, controlling flow, and handling exceptions [8]. This automation capability contributes to reducing labor costs and maximizing resource utilization [22,34].  

Effective BPMS operation relies on robust data and document management components. These manage and store processgenerated data and documents, incorporating features for version control, sharing, access rights management, and security [8]. Such systems integrate data from various sources across the enterprise, including structured, unstructured, and tabular data, supporting functions like data analysis [18,34]. Beyond traditional sources, some systems capture workflow data directly from user interactions to provide comprehensive process intelligence [35].​  

Monitoring and reporting components are vital for providing visibility into process performance. These features leverage collected data for real-time analysis through dashboards, charts, and reports [8,24]. Process Intelligence platforms, frequently incorporating techniques like process mining, analyze this data to identify bottlenecks, evaluate efficiency, and generate actionable insights for optimization [15,32,36]. This analytical feedback loop is crucial for continuous process improvement, aiming to enhance key metrics like cycle times and resource utilization [10,22,34].​  

BPMS fundamentally links people and systems, managing information access and transformation, handling exceptions, and orchestrating the overall process flow [19]. Key features supporting these functions include task management and allocation tools that enable automatic assignment, priority adjustment, and reminders [8]. Integration capabilities are essential for connecting the BPMS with other enterprise systems such as ERP and CRM, often utilizing APIs like RESTful APIs [10,12]. Some advanced approaches even aim for zero backend integration to simplify deployment [35].  

Modern BPMS increasingly incorporates AI-driven functionalities. Process intelligence and process mining tools provide a comprehensive view of actual workflows, enabling organizations to analyze operations, predict outcomes, and receive prescriptive recommendations for improvement [10,15,18,30]. AI supports intelligent automation, risk identification, and real-time compliance reporting [6]. Features like simulation engines allow for evaluating the potential impact of process changes before implementation [10,25]. The emergence of AI agents facilitates automated task processing and intelligent allocation [6,36].​  

The benefits derived from these features are substantial, including improved efficiency, reduced errors, enhanced decisionmaking through data-backed insights, lower operational costs, and increased organizational agility [9,10,22,23]. Different BPMS vendors offer varied strengths and feature sets; for instance, some platforms emphasize visual, code-free development based on technologies like .NET, while others highlight integrated engines for process, forms, and reporting, or focus on the entire process lifecycle and mobile/distributed deployment support [34]. The suitability of a particular BPMS depends on aligning its architecture and feature capabilities with the specific needs of an organization [20]. While core components and features are widely recognized, detailed insights into specific mechanisms like task assignment within execution engines or advanced data management security features are areas where research or vendor documentation often provides more depth than the available digests. The future direction points towards more sophisticated AI integration and novel architectural concepts like Large Process Models [18].  

# 3.1 Architecture and Core Components  

Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) are characterized by an architecture comprising several interconnected core components designed to facilitate the systematic design, execution, monitoring, and optimization of organizational processes. These components collectively enable enterprises to integrate various departments and processes, supporting coordinated operations and decision-making [9,22].​  

A foundational element of BPMS is the process modeling component. This allows for the systematic design of business processes, a capability highlighted as crucial for shortening process cycles and improving efficiency [22]. Contemporary BPMS often incorporate visual modeling tools, frequently integrated within low-code platforms, which simplify the definition of complex workflows. Features such as rich process nodes and condition judgment are fundamental to accurately representing process logic and control flow [34]. Emerging architectural visions, such as those involving Large Process Models, suggest future modeling approaches may bridge natural language descriptions with executable representations through components like a process atom layer [18].​  

The execution engine is central to the automation capabilities of a BPMS, taking designed process models and translating them into executable workflows. This engine is responsible for automating tasks and managing the sequence of process steps, contributing to the reduction of labor costs and the maximization of resource utilization [22,34]. While digests emphasize automated execution and condition judgment features essential for process control [34], detailed aspects such as specific mechanisms for automated task assignment or the handling of process exceptions within the execution engine are not extensively described in the provided materials.​  

Effective data and document management are critical for BPMS functionality, supporting the integration of data and business context from various sources across the enterprise [36]. BPMS architectures often include components to manage diverse data and knowledge sources, encompassing structured knowledge, unstructured data, and tabular data [18]. Furthermore, systems may employ sophisticated methods, such as observing work directly from user desktops, to capture comprehensive process data [35]. This data integration facilitates functionalities like data analysis [34]. Although the  

importance of robust data handling is evident, the provided digests do not offer detailed insights into specific features related to version control, data sharing protocols, or security measures within the data and document management components of BPMS.  

Monitoring and reporting functionalities form another vital component, enabling organizations to gain visibility into ongoing process performance. These features leverage collected process data for real-time analysis across numerous operations and cases [35]. Process Intelligence platforms, often integrating techniques like process mining, analyze process data to identify bottlenecks, assess efficiency, and generate actionable insights [36]. The capability for data analysis provided by BPMS supports tracking performance and informing optimization efforts aimed at improving key metrics such as cycle times and resource utilization [22,34]. This monitoring and analysis loop, sometimes considered part of core components like Data Analytics [9], is crucial for continuous process improvement. The interrelationship between these core components—modeling defining the process, execution automating it, data management providing the necessary information context, and monitoring/reporting enabling performance analysis and subsequent optimization—forms a continuous cycle fundamental to effective business process management.​  

# 3.2 Key Features and Capabilities  

Business Process Management (BPM) systems are characterized by a diverse set of features and capabilities designed to enhance organizational efficiency and adaptability. A fundamental aspect of BPM tools is their ability to facilitate process modeling, which often utilizes standardized languages such as BPMN 2.0 [12]. Tools supporting BPMN 2.0 provide a common notation for mapping processes, aiding clarity and communication. For instance, ADONIS offers full support for BPMN 2.0, including features for syntax validation and adherence to best practices, available through a web modeler [12]. The ease of use in modeling is often enhanced by visual workflow maps and drag-and-drop editors, enabling intuitive process design [24].​  

Development approaches within BPM systems have evolved significantly. Many modern platforms emphasize low-code or no-code capabilities, allowing organizations to rapidly configure and customize complex business scenarios without extensive programming [6]. Examples such as 天翎MyAppsBPM and K2 Platform demonstrate rapid and flexible development for custom systems and support visual process design with multi-functional form development tools. 微宏 AlphaFlow is also noted for its low-code approach [6]. This contrasts with traditional development models, offering increased agility and reduced learning costs.  

Automation capabilities are central to BPM systems, underpinned by workflow engines that execute defined processes. These capabilities facilitate process automation, standardization, and continuous improvement, leading to enhanced work efficiency and reduced operational costs [8,9]. Real-time monitoring and data analysis features provide visibility into ongoing operations, allowing for the identification of issues and data-backed decision-making [9,15,22,24,30]. Reporting and analytics tools offer insights through dashboards, graphical views, and query capabilities [12,24].​  

Integration capabilities are crucial for connecting BPM systems with other enterprise applications. While traditional integrations like email support remain useful [24], modern systems offer real-time data integration, object-centric understanding, and API support, such as RESTful APIs for portal integration offered by ADONIS [12,15,32,35]. Some platforms, like Skan AI, aim for zero backend integration to streamline deployment [35]. Document management and sharing are also common features, although integration with cloud storage is increasingly prevalent [12,24,39].  

AI-driven functionalities represent a significant advancement in BPM tools. Process intelligence platforms leverage AI to provide a clear view of current operations, enabling businesses to redesign activities, evaluate potential changes, and predict future impacts [30]. This includes capabilities like conformance checking, benchmarking, and simulation [32]. AI is also integrated for intelligent process automation, risk identification, and real-time compliance reporting [6]. Process mining tools, often AI-powered, transform business data into actionable views of actual workflows, offering prescriptive recommendations and uncovering insights to accelerate transformation [15,18]. The emergence of AI agents, such as those enabled by AgentC in the Celonis platform or the Agentic Workflow support in 微宏AlphaFlow, facilitates automated task processing and intelligent allocation based on environmental changes [6,32,36].​  

Beyond these core areas, BPM systems offer features like flexible configuration based on enterprise needs, high scalability for future growth, support for extended business scenarios (e.g., QM, GRC), and robust cloud computing technology for data processing and security [12]. While support for mobile and distributed work environments is a sought-after feature, specific details on implementation vary across tools.  

The suitability of different BPM tools for various organizational contexts depends on the alignment of these features with specific needs related to size, industry, and complexity of processes [20]. Organizations with highly complex and dataintensive processes may benefit most from advanced AI-driven process intelligence and mining capabilities, while those prioritizing rapid process implementation and flexibility might opt for systems strong in low-code/no-code development and intuitive modeling. The availability of scalable cloud-based solutions and flexible configuration options caters to organizations of different sizes and evolving requirements.

Business Process Management (BPM) encompasses a range of methodologies and approaches, each designed to optimize processes with distinct focuses and scopes within an organization [25]. Understanding these variations is fundamental for aligning process improvement efforts with strategic objectives and operational needs. Different BPM types are categorized based on their primary goal and the nature of the processes they address, including approaches focused on operational efficiency, strategic alignment, dynamic adaptability, and the handling of specific process elements such as documents, models, cases, decisions, or events [25]. The selection of a particular BPM type is contingent upon a careful assessment of organizational context, desired outcomes, process complexity, and the interplay of human judgment, data, and system interactions [25]. This necessitates evaluating the strengths and suitability of each type for different organizational scenarios and potentially employing a combination of types to meet comprehensive needs [25].​  

Complementing the diverse BPM approaches are various types of Business Process Management Systems (BPMS), which are technological platforms built to facilitate the implementation and execution of these process management strategies. These systems differ primarily in their core functionalities and the aspects of business processes they are designed to emphasize [3,26]. Prominent categories include integration-centric, human-centric, and document-centric BPMS [3,26]. Integrationcentric systems prioritize seamless automation and data exchange across disparate enterprise systems, reducing manual handoffs and enhancing throughput for processes heavily reliant on system-to-system interaction [3,26]. Human-centric systems, conversely, are optimized for workflows requiring significant human interaction, collaboration, and decisionmaking, providing intuitive interfaces and tools to support user tasks and accountability [3,26]. Document-centric BPMS specialize in managing processes centered around documents, automating their handling, validation, and storage to ensure accuracy, compliance, and efficient record-keeping [3,26]. The choice of BPMS type significantly impacts organizational efficiency and effectiveness, and its adoption should align with the dominant characteristics and requirements of the processes targeted for management and improvement. Comparing and contrasting these system types based on their primary focus areas—integration, human skills, and document management—provides a framework for understanding when each system is most appropriate, typically aligning with the type of BPM approach being pursued and the specific challenges of the organizational context [3,26].​  

# 4.1 Types of Business Process Management  

Business Process Management encompasses a variety of approaches, each tailored to address distinct organizational needs and process characteristics [25]. Understanding these different types is crucial for selecting the most appropriate BPM system or methodology for a given context. Several key types of BPM have been identified, including Operational, Strategic, Dynamic, Document-driven, Model-driven, Case-driven, Decision-driven, and Event-driven BPM [25].  

Operational BPM is fundamentally focused on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of day-to-day operational business processes [25]. Its primary goals include automating manual tasks, reducing operational expenditures, and improving both customer service quality and satisfaction [25]. This type is highly applicable in environments requiring streamlined, repeatable workflows with clear steps.  

In contrast, Strategic BPM adopts a broader perspective, aiming to manage, optimize, and align business processes with overarching organizational objectives and strategic goals [25]. It serves to identify and eliminate inefficiencies across the organizational landscape, thereby improving overall productivity and effectiveness in service of strategic aims [25]. Strategic BPM is suited for organizations undergoing transformation or seeking to ensure process coherence with corporate strategy.​  

Dynamic BPM distinguishes itself by enabling businesses to rapidly adapt and modify their processes in real time [25]. Its utility lies in the ability to swiftly identify areas for improvement and implement necessary changes without the need to halt or restart ongoing processes [25]. This type is particularly valuable in volatile or rapidly changing business environments where agility is paramount.​  

Document-driven BPM centers process automation and management around documents as the principal medium [25]. By structuring processes around document flows, organizations can achieve efficient and effective process execution, making this type suitable for scenarios where document handling is a core component of the workflow [25].  

Model-driven BPM utilizes visual models as the foundation for describing and analyzing business processes [25]. This approach employs structured, graphical elements to represent activities, data flows, decision points, and relationships within a process, providing a clear blueprint for process design and analysis [25]. It is beneficial for complex processes requiring detailed visualization and formal modeling.  

For processes characterized by complex and unpredictable human interactions, Case-driven BPM offers a powerful tool [25]. This methodology focuses on analyzing how individuals interact with each other and the process itself, making it highly applicable in knowledge-intensive environments or where workflows are less structured and more dependent on human judgment and collaboration [25].  

Decision-driven BPM is specifically designed to automate and optimize decision-making processes within workflows [25]. Leveraging data analysis and artificial intelligence, it identifies opportunities for improvement and facilitates faster, more informed decisions, proving valuable in processes with critical decision points [25].  

Finally, Event-driven BPM provides an efficient mechanism for automating business processes by utilizing triggers to respond to specific events or changes in process-related data, such as customer orders or employee records [25]. This type is well suited for reactive systems that need to respond automatically to external or internal triggers.  

Selecting the appropriate BPM type necessitates a careful assessment of specific organizational needs and goals. Organizations prioritizing efficiency in repetitive tasks may opt for Operational BPM, while those needing strategic alignment should consider Strategic BPM. Environments demanding real-time adaptability benefit from Dynamic BPM. Processes heavily reliant on documentation or complex human judgment point towards Document-driven or Case-driven BPM, respectively. Model-driven BPM supports detailed process design and analysis, while Decision-driven and Event-driven BPM address specific needs related to automated decision-making and reactive processing. Therefore, the selection process should align the inherent characteristics and strengths of each BPM type with the desired process outcomes, complexity, variability, and the role of data, documents, decisions, events, and human interaction within the targeted processes.​  

# 4.2 Types of Business Process Management Systems  

Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) can be broadly categorized into several types based on their primary focus and the nature of the processes they are designed to manage. Prominently, research distinguishes between integrationcentric, human-centric, and document-centric BPMS [3,26]. Each type possesses distinct features, advantages, and application scenarios tailored to specific organizational needs.  

Integration-centric BPMS are primarily engineered to automate operations and orchestrate processes that span across multiple existing organizational systems, such as Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platforms [3,26]. These systems minimize the need for human intervention by leveraging connectors and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to facilitate seamless data exchange and automated task execution between disparate applications [3]. A key benefit of integration-centric BPMS is their capability to create fast-moving processes and significantly reduce or eliminate manual handoffs between systems, thereby enhancing efficiency and throughput [3]. Their application scenarios typically involve Straight-Through Processing (STP) or processes where the flow of information and tasks between systems is paramount.​  

In contrast, human-centric BPMS prioritize the human element within business processes [3,26]. These systems are designed with the skills and interactions of people in mind, providing user-friendly interfaces, simple notifications, and tools that enable users to manage tasks and collaborate effectively [3,26]. The focus is on supporting human decision-making, task assignment, and accountability within the workflow. A significant advantage of human-centric BPMS is that they make it easier for employees to understand their roles and responsibilities, facilitating quick tracking and enhancing accountability [3]. These systems are particularly suited for processes that are complex, require significant human judgment, involve collaboration among multiple stakeholders, or are highly variable in nature.​  

Document-centric BPMS are specifically oriented towards processes where documents, such as contracts or invoices, are central to the workflow [3,26]. The primary role of this type of BPMS is to manage the lifecycle of documents, automating tasks related to their handling, formatting, validation, and verification [3]. These systems are crucial for streamlining  

document-related processes and ensuring accuracy and compliance with regulatory requirements and internal policies [26]. Document-centric BPMS are invaluable in scenarios involving extensive paperwork, digital document processing, approval workflows for documents, and record keeping, playing a vital role in maintaining audit trails and ensuring regulatory adherence [3]. While integration-centric systems focus on data flow between systems and human-centric systems focus on human tasks, document-centric systems provide specialized capabilities for processes revolving around documents, often incorporating features for digital signatures, version control, and secure storage.  

# 5. Technologies Enabling and Related to BPMS  

The effective implementation and evolution of Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) are critically enabled and shaped by a diverse array of related technologies. Modern IT solutions, particularly those leveraging cloud-native architectures such as microservices and containerization, provide a robust foundation for BPMS deployment and operation, enhancing agility and reducing costs [10,29]. This section analyzes the synergistic relationship between BPM and key technological advancements, demonstrating how their integration yields significant business value [37].​  

Central to this technological landscape are advancements in process analysis and automation. Process Mining and Process Intelligence offer empirical, data-driven approaches to discover, monitor, and analyze actual process executions, revealing inefficiencies and bottlenecks and providing insights for optimization [2,4,15,36,40]. Complementing analytical capabilities, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) provides a powerful tool for automating repetitive, rule-based tasks, often identified through process analysis [6,29].​  

Emerging technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), are profoundly transforming the BPM domain. AI is increasingly integrated into BPMS for tasks ranging from optimizing process paths and intelligent decision support to processing unstructured data and identifying risks [6]. The synergy between process intelligence, AI, and RPA is driving sophisticated enterprise-wide automation, enabling "BPM bot workers" and "AI and RPA bot scaffolding" frameworks capable of handling complex tasks with increased efficiency and measurable results [1,15,32]. The integration of these technologies is actively being investigated for its potential benefits and associated challenges within BPM [20].  

Beyond AI, RPA, and process intelligence, other enabling technologies are shaping the future of BPM. Cloud computing provides the flexible and scalable infrastructure necessary for modern BPMS, although detailed analyses of specific benefits and challenges in this context warrant further research [12,22]. Low-code and no-code platforms are democratizing process application development, allowing citizen developers to rapidly build and customize workflows, significantly reducing development time and costs [1,6,34]. Digital twin technology is enabling real-time modeling and visualization of business processes and the organization itself, providing end-to-end visibility and supporting simulation and change impact prediction [10,30]. Agentic Workflow, leveraging AI agents, is facilitating intelligent task allocation and automated processing based on environmental changes [6,40]. Additionally, technologies like IoT, Blockchain, Microservices, SOA, and Hyperautomation hold potential to further extend BPM capabilities and efficiency [1,16,29,30,35,43].

Collectively, these technological trends are instrumental in enabling organizations to achieve greater agility, operational efficiency, and innovation through their BPMS implementations [10]. The subsequent sections will delve deeper into the specific characteristics, applications, and impacts of each of these critical technology categories on the field of Business Process Management.​  

# 5.1 Process Mining and Intelligence  

Process mining serves as a crucial complement to Business Process Management (BPM) by offering an empirical, datadriven approach to understanding how processes are executed in reality [2,40]. Unlike theoretical models, process mining extracts event logs, or digital footprints, from existing enterprise systems such as ERP and CRM to reveal the actual process flows [2,4,18,25]. This data-centric perspective allows organizations to discover how their processes truly operate, often identifying significant variances between planned business models and actual approaches [25]. The primary benefits include revealing process inefficiencies, accurately locating bottlenecks, highlighting reworks, and identifying deviations [2,4,25,40]. Conformance checking, a key capability, compares actual process execution against predefined models or rules, which is vital for improving compliance and adherence to standards [2,36].  

Process mining encompasses core capabilities utilized throughout the process lifecycle: discovery, monitoring, and improvement [4,36]. Process discovery involves automatically generating process models from event data, providing comprehensive visualizations of complex workflows [15,40]. This capability is fundamental as it provides the initial, often surprising, insight into how processes actually run in real-world scenarios [2]. Process monitoring provides continuous, realtime insights into process execution and its impact on key performance indicators (KPIs) [4,40]. The importance lies in enabling organizations to react promptly to performance issues or deviations. Process improvement leverages the insights gained to analyze weak spots, simulate potential changes (e.g., through what-if scenarios), benchmark against best practices, and facilitate prescriptive automation to optimize processes [2,15,36,40]. Underlying these capabilities are crucial features like real-time data integration and enterprise-wide visibility, which connect data across various systems (ERP, CRM, etc.) to provide a unified view [2,4,15,36]. A significant advancement is Object-Centric Process Mining (OCPM), which moves beyond static, single-case views to a dynamic understanding of interacting objects within processes, effectively creating a digital twin [2,36].​  

Process mining solutions are offered by various vendors, each with distinct emphasis [4,36]. Celonis leverages process mining to establish a novel class of data and business context, delivering enterprise-wide visibility and object-centric understanding to enable conformance checking, benchmarking, simulation, and prescriptive automation [36]. UiPath Process Mining utilizes digital footprints to reveal process details and identify automation opportunities, offering real-time integration, enterprise-wide visibility, model-based process mining incorporating AI for decision-making, continuous monitoring of KPIs, and security features such as data anonymization and role-based access control [4]. Apromore focuses on automating business process discovery and analysis by mapping workflows across systems, allowing connection to IT systems for data collection, visualization, weak spot analysis, simulation, and performance monitoring [40]. IBM Process Mining visualizes workflows and connects data across systems like ERP and CRM to uncover inefficiencies and provide a realtime unified view, utilizing predictive and scenario-based analytics for simulation and risk minimization [15]. Skan AI provides a $3 6 0 ^ { \circ }$ process intelligence view spanning diverse system types, including Mainframe, Citrix, on-premise, and webbased applications, to uncover inefficiencies [35]. While vendors share core process mining functionalities, they differentiate through specific capabilities like OCPM, AI integration, simulation depth, system coverage, and security features.​  

Process intelligence extends the foundation of process mining, capturing deeper value hidden within processes to facilitate more informed decisions [30,37]. It starts with process mining to extract event timestamps and build a digital twin, offering a visual model of operational flow and enabling identification of deviations and root causes [30]. By providing these insights, process intelligence empowers organizations to optimize operations effectively [30,37], creating the necessary engine to rapidly enhance enterprise resilience and adaptability [42].  

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly prominent in both process mining and intelligence. Process intelligence is seen as fueling AI capabilities [32]. AI is incorporated into model-based process mining for decision-making and pattern recognition [4]. Furthermore, real-time process mining, when combined with generative AI, allows for a proactive approach to anomaly detection and accelerates data analysis by recognizing patterns [1]. Conversational process mining is emerging, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for interacting with process data [18]. The goal of full-cycle process mining is to simplify process map discovery and improvement, potentially making these tools more accessible without requiring deep process expertise, although further development is needed in this area [1].​  

# 5.2 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning  

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly recognized for their transformative potential in automating and optimizing business processes [36]. By providing AI with the necessary data and business context, derived from process intelligence, organizations can enable the development of effective AI agents on leading platforms [32,36]. This integration is fundamentally transforming business process management (BPM), fostering greater automation,  

intelligence, and adaptability [37]. AI and ML, alongside other strategic technologies, are instrumental in facilitating key performance indicator (KPI) visibility and driving their improvement over time [37]. The implementation of custom AI solutions within workflows can automate repetitive tasks, enhance decision-making capabilities, and consequently allow teams to concentrate on higher-impact strategic work [31].  

The integration of AI technologies into Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) platforms is manifesting in various forms. Process intelligence leverages AI to optimize end-to-end workflows by analyzing data from diverse sources to identify patterns and rectify inefficiencies [30]. AI-powered process modeling techniques, particularly within model-based Process Mining, utilize AI-based decision-making and pattern recognition to identify process bottlenecks and enhance efficiency [4]. Platforms like Skan AI apply AI to generate comprehensive insights across operational areas, aiming to boost productivity, improve utilization, and refine technology usage. This includes driving human-centric productivity, ensuring process integrity and compliance through real-time monitoring, and achieving operational excellence with AI-driven insights. Furthermore, Skan AI provides critical operational data necessary for training and optimizing enterprise Agentic AI [35]. Apromore integrates AI into its no-code platform, empowering business users with capabilities to visualize, analyze, and improve processes, and has demonstrated AI-driven process intelligence applications at organizations like Westpac [40]. IBM Process Mining incorporates prescriptive process mining leveraging AI for actionable recommendations. It provides AIpowered conversational assistants to democratize process analysis and insight discovery for non-technical users, utilizes prescriptive AI insights to identify and resolve bottlenecks, enables process comparisons across units, uncovers root causes, and tailors insights for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals [15]. Additionally, AI algorithms embedded in BPMS can optimize process paths, minimize manual intervention, process unstructured data (e.g., contract approvals), offer intelligent decision support, automatically identify risk points, and generate real-time compliance reports [6]. These technologies are also leveraged for orchestrating enterprise-wide automation initiatives, often in conjunction with robotic process automation (RPA), low-code platforms, and decision analytics [15]. AI-driven process insights can be integrated into platforms like watsonx Orchestrate to build personalized AI assistants and agents, augmenting productivity and simplifying tasks [15].  

Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant trend, being rapidly infused into BPM platforms to assist with process design, integration, and the creation of AI-driven workflow agents capable of generating subtasks and learning through feedback loops [1]. GenAI is noted for its ability to improve workflows, enhance specific tasks, reduce subsequent work, and facilitate process scalability [1]. Unlocking the full potential of Generative AI in BPM is seen as dependent on its integration with process mining and enterprise architecture software [40]. However, effectively leveraging LLMs for process management necessitates fine-tuning them for specific process verticals, regions, and organizations [18]. AI also contributes to applications such as predictive analytics and the delivery of personalized customer experiences [6,16,30].​  

While the potential benefits of AI adoption in BPM are substantial, addressing ethical concerns and potential risks is crucial [6,16,30,37]. Discussions surrounding AI implementation in BPM highlight the need to navigate AI-led disruptions and align AI capabilities with organizational goals [42]. A cautionary perspective exists regarding the deployment of fully autonomous AI agents, suggesting that their foreseeable harms may currently outweigh their benefits [42]. Regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, emphasize the importance of transparency in the creation and utilization of AI systems [42]. These considerations underscore the need for careful planning and governance in the increasing integration of AI into organizational processes.​  

# 5.3 Robotic Process Automation (RPA)  

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) represents a distinct yet complementary approach to Business Process Management (BPM) within the broader landscape of organizational automation and digital transformation [3,29]. While BPM typically focuses on the holistic design, analysis, execution, monitoring, and optimization of end-to-end business processes, RPA is primarily concerned with automating specific, often repetitive, and rule-based tasks previously performed by humans [6]. RPA bots mimic human interactions with digital systems, rapidly automating tasks and facilitating cross-system data interaction, particularly effective for addressing short-term bottlenecks [6,29].  

The synergy between BPM and RPA lies in their ability to collaborate for comprehensive process streamlining. BPM provides the overarching framework for understanding, modeling, and managing the entire process flow, identifying areas ripe for automation. RPA then serves as a powerful tool within the BPMS ecosystem, executing the specific tasks identified for  

automation [1]. This integration allows for the creation of "BPM bot workers" capable of handling increasingly complex tasks, thereby amplifying the automation capabilities orchestrated by the BPMS [1].  

Further enhancing the levels of automation, BPMS platforms are increasingly integrated with both RPA and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies [23]. AI capabilities, often leveraged through techniques like process mining, play a crucial role in identifying specific automation opportunities within existing processes [4]. Process mining analyzes process data to uncover inefficiencies and areas where RPA can be most effectively applied, generating a backlog of potential automation initiatives [4]. AI can also help estimate the business value of these identified opportunities and validate automation solutions before deployment [35]. The combination of AI for intelligent analysis and identification, RPA for task automation, and BPMS for process orchestration creates a powerful "AI and RPA bot scaffolding" framework capable of driving enterprisewide automation with measurable results [15]. Platforms integrating process mining with automation execution, such as the UiPath Business Automation Platform, exemplify this trend towards holistic business process automation [4].  

# 5.4 Cloud Computing and IoT  

Cloud computing has emerged as a pivotal technological foundation for modern Business Process Management Systems, significantly influencing their deployment and operation within organizational contexts. The readiness of contemporary IT solutions to function within managed cloud environments, such as Kubernetes or Serverless architectures, underscores the central role of cloud infrastructure in empowering digital transformation initiatives through BPMS [44]. The utilization of cloud technology is fundamental for achieving efficient data processing and storage within BPMS, contributing positively to data security and system stability [22].  

Several BPMS vendors and tools have adopted cloud-based models or offer flexible cloud deployment options, reflecting the industry's shift towards leveraging cloud capabilities. Examples include ADONIS:Community Edition, which is presented as a cloud-based BPM tool [12], and UiPath Process Mining, which provides various deployment choices including Automation Cloud, Automation Suite, and both Public and Private Cloud environments [4]. These instances highlight the tangible integration of cloud computing within the BPMS landscape, enabling broader accessibility and varied deployment strategies for organizations.​  

While the potential impact of cloud computing on the scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of BPM solutions is recognized [12,36], the provided digest information does not offer detailed analyses or evidence concerning these specific benefits. Similarly, the role of the Internet of Things (IoT) in enabling real-time monitoring and control of business processes, along with specific examples of successful implementations, is not extensively covered in the available materials. Furthermore, a comprehensive examination of the challenges related to security and compliance in cloud-based BPMS environments and detailed strategies for mitigating these risks is not present in the provided digests, despite the general mention of cloud technology contributing to data security and stability [22]. A more in-depth review would necessitate further research into studies specifically addressing these critical aspects of cloud and IoT integration in BPMS.  

# 5.5 Other Enabling Technologies  

Beyond core BPMS functionalities, several enabling technologies are significantly transforming the landscape of business process management. These innovations facilitate greater accessibility, automation, and analytical depth within organizational processes.  

A key trend is the increasing prominence of low-code and no-code platforms, which are playing a crucial role in translating nascent ideas into streamlined business operations [1]. These platforms democratize process application development, enabling personnel without deep technical expertise, often referred to as “citizen developers,” to build cross-platform process applications [6]. This capability reduces reliance on specialized IT resources, potentially yielding substantial savings in development costs [6]. The desire for fully automated BPM tools capable of rapidly deploying customized workflows is driving businesses to seek these solutions, with an industry report indicating that a significant majority of IT leaders have already explored low-code options for their organizations [24]. Examples of platforms incorporating low-code/no-code technology include Apromore [40] and IBM Process Mining [15], the latter supporting low-code platforms to orchestrate enterprise-wide automation [15].​  

Digital twin technology is also emerging as a vital component in modern BPM. Process intelligence enables the creation of a digital twin of business processes, offering a real-time, comprehensive model of operations [30]. This allows organizations to gain end-to-end visibility into their processes [15] and build digital representations of the organization itself [12]. Both ADONIS [12] and IBM Process Mining [15] are noted for their capability to facilitate the creation of process digital twins.  

Agentic Workflow, leveraging advancements in Agentic AI, represents another impactful technological shift [40]. This methodology facilitates the automated processing of tasks and enables the intelligent allocation of processing paths based on changes in the operational environment [6]. The integration of Agentforce within platforms like Apromore underscores the growing importance of AI agents in process intelligence [40]. Similarly, Celonis has developed AgentC, a suite of AI agent tools aimed at enabling the construction of effective AI agents for process optimization [36]. These agent-based approaches hold potential for increasing automation and adaptability in BPM workflows.  

Blockchain technology is also cited as having potential roles in shaping BPM and BPMS, although specific applications and detailed impacts like improving transparency and security are not elaborated upon in the provided materials [6,16,30]. Hyperautomation is another area identified as having the potential to transform business processes and enhance organizational performance, though details on its specific mechanisms and effects based on the provided digests are limited [35].​  

Collectively, these technologies—low-code/no-code platforms, digital twins, Agentic Workflow, alongside emerging potential in Blockchain and Hyperautomation—signify a broader trend towards more accessible, intelligent, and automated business process management solutions. They represent critical enablers for organizations seeking to enhance agility, efficiency, and visibility in their operations.​  

# 6. BPM Lifecycle, Methodologies, and Process Optimization  

Effective Business Process Management (BPM) within organizational contexts necessitates a structured approach encompassing a defined lifecycle, the application of appropriate methodologies, and systematic process optimization.  

![](images/90d0c7b199f7cac7b48a7799f8c27cb608323de1bfe4db17b038764c4818495f.jpg)  

The BPM lifecycle provides a framework for continuous process improvement, guiding organizations through iterative stages from understanding current processes to refining future performance [3,25,26]. While various models exist, common phases include Planning/Discovery, Modeling/Design, Implementation/Development, Execution/Monitoring, and Optimization/Deployment [3,9,10,19,22,25,26,40]. The Planning or Discovery phase involves setting goals, defining scope, establishing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and analyzing existing processes to understand current pain points and  

assess value [3,4,10,22,25,26,40]. Process mining tools are increasingly utilized in this phase to automatically discover processes from system data [1,4,40].  

The Modeling or Design stage translates findings into a visual representation or blueprint of the improved process, detailing workflows, tasks, and data flow [3,26,40]. Tools like business process mapping software are crucial here [14]. This phase may also involve asking "what-if" questions using process modeling capabilities [1]. The Implementation or Development phase focuses on deploying the redesigned process, which includes development, testing, customization, integration, and training [10,26]. This phase requires careful change management for successful adoption [25]. Often, starting with a smallscale pilot or Proof of Concept (PoC) is recommended before wider rollout [10,14,29].  

Following implementation, the Execution and Monitoring phase involves running the process and tracking its performance against predefined KPIs using dashboards and reporting systems [3,25,26]. Real-time visibility and data collection are essential for identifying bottlenecks, deviations, and inefficiencies [26,40]. Process intelligence and mining tools facilitate automatic monitoring and analysis of transactional data [4,15,30,40]. The final stage is Optimization or Deployment, which is an ongoing effort to refine processes based on monitoring data and feedback, aiming to enhance efficiency and effectiveness [3,10,25,26,31]. This closed-loop approach, moving from monitoring and analysis to targeted improvement, is fundamental to achieving process health and desired outcomes [15]. Adaptive process management is emerging to handle unexpected factors during execution, enabling continuous improvement where design, execution, and analysis converge [1,18]. Analyzing problems and their business and technical consequences is integrated across these lifecycle phases [19].  

Business Process Optimization (BPO) is a critical component within the BPM lifecycle, focusing on systematically improving processes to achieve organizational goals [3,26,31]. Various methodologies provide frameworks for BPO, notably Six Sigma, Lean, and Total Quality Management (TQM) [3,14,25,28,37].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Methodology</td><td>Primary Focus</td><td>Key Principle(s)</td><td>Main Goal(s)</td><td>Tool/Approach</td></tr><tr><td>TQM</td><td>Organization- wide Quality</td><td>Continuous Improvement, Customer Focus</td><td>Improve Quality, Enhance Customer Satisfaction</td><td>Quality Management Tools</td></tr><tr><td>Six Sigma</td><td>Variation Reduction, Standardization</td><td>Data-driven analysis, Statistical Control</td><td>Increase Efficiency, Reduce Defects, Culture of Improvement</td><td>DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)</td></tr><tr><td>Lean</td><td>Waste Elimination, Flow Optimization</td><td>Identify& Remove Non- Value-Adding Activities</td><td>Optimize Efficiency, Reduce Costs, Faster Delivery</td><td>Value Stream Mapping, 5S, Kanban</td></tr></table></body></html>  

While all aim for process enhancement, they differ in focus: TQM emphasizes organization-wide quality improvement and customer satisfaction [14,28]; Six Sigma focuses on reducing variation and standardizing processes using structured approaches like DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) to boost efficiency and foster a continuous improvement culture [14,28,37]; and Lean prioritizes the elimination of non-value-adding activities (waste) to optimize flow and efficiency from a customer perspective [14,28]. Understanding the principles and objectives of these methodologies is vital for selecting the most suitable approach for specific optimization goals [28]. Some BPM tools, like ADONIS, explicitly support methodologies such as Lean and Kaizen [12].  

The steps involved in BPO are well-defined across different frameworks. A common sequence includes defining the current process, analyzing it for issues and performance gaps, redesigning the process, implementing the optimized version, and evaluating the results [14]. Defining the process often involves mapping workflows, while analysis utilizes data, process intelligence, and process mining to identify bottlenecks and root causes of inefficiencies [4,14,15,30,40]. Redesign requires defining scope, conducting risk analysis, and crucially, consulting with employees performing the process [12,14,26].  

Implementation should be phased, starting small [14]. Evaluation involves documenting lessons learned and ensuring changes are sustained, often by comparing metrics before and after optimization [14,28].  

Actionable guidance for designing, modeling, executing, monitoring, and optimizing processes within the BPM lifecycle emphasizes several best practices. Clearly defining goals and KPIs in the initial stages is paramount for measuring success [3,10,26]. Utilizing visual modeling tools aids in clearly communicating processes and simulating changes [3,26]. During execution and implementation, effective change management is crucial, along with potentially starting with a PoC [25,29]. Continuous monitoring using tools that provide real-time visibility and automated alerts is essential for identifying issues promptly [15,26,40]. Optimization should be an ongoing, data-driven effort, leveraging analytical insights from monitoring and potentially using simulation tools to test proposed improvements [4,26,31,40]. Common pitfalls include inadequate initial analysis, insufficient stakeholder involvement in design, poor change management during implementation, and a lack of sustained monitoring and continuous improvement [14,25,43]. Ensuring continuous observation through process mining helps determine effectiveness and guide ongoing optimization efforts [4]. While AI-enabled optimization offers potential, maintaining human oversight is necessary to prevent undesirable outcomes [18]. The establishment of a Process Management Office (PMO) and a robust measurement system support long-term continuous optimization [10]. Future research directions include further exploring the integration of advanced process intelligence and AI into these lifecycle stages and methodologies to enhance automation, prediction, and adaptive capabilities [1,15,30]. Challenges lie in effectively tailoring and combining methodologies for diverse organizational contexts and ensuring that the continuous optimization loop is effectively implemented and sustained [19,25].  

# 6.1 The BPM Lifecycle Stages  

Implementing and effectively managing Business Process Management (BPM) within an organization necessitates navigating through a structured lifecycle, which provides a systematic approach to continuous process improvement [26]. This lifecycle typically involves several interconnected stages, guiding organizations from understanding their current state to optimizing future performance. While specific terminology may vary, core phases include planning, modeling, implementation, monitoring, and optimization [26]. Other frameworks describe similar stages such as demand analysis, design, development, testing, and online operation, or demand analysis, system selection, customization, integration, training, change management, and continuous optimization, all reflecting the cyclical nature of process management [9,22].  

A step-by-step guide for organizations can be constructed based on these lifecycle phases. It begins with the Planning and Design stage, where objectives are defined and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are established [26]. This initial analysis phase may involve understanding current demands and analyzing existing systems [9,22]. Following planning, the Modeling stage involves visually representing processes, often after a process analysis or system selection phase [9,26]. This creates a clear blueprint for process execution. The modeled processes are then moved to the Implementation stage, which includes development, testing, deployment, customization, integration, and training [9,22,26]. Once implemented, processes enter the Execution and Monitoring phase, where they are operated and their performance is tracked in real-time using reporting systems [22,26]. The final stage is Optimization, where processes are continuously refined based on data analysis and feedback [9,26].​  

Streamlining processes and measuring performance are critical activities integrated throughout the lifecycle. Setting clear KPIs during the planning phase is fundamental for measuring the impact of process improvements and automation on endto-end processes [4,26]. During the monitoring and analysis phases, BPM tools and process mining capabilities enable organizations to collect transactional data, visualize process flows, and analyze performance against these predefined KPIs [40]. This analysis helps detect weak spots, bottlenecks, and deviations from expected performance or Service Level Agreements (SLAs) [40]. Reporting systems provide the necessary data visibility for this analysis [26].​  

Modern BPM products incorporate features designed to address potential challenges and facilitate effective management across these stages. For instance, process mining tools allow for automatic collection and visualization of process data from IT systems, providing empirical insights into actual process execution [40]. Based on the analysis of this data and adherence to KPIs, systems can alert users to issues, predict deviations, or even trigger corrective actions automatically when specific business logic or thresholds are met [15,40]. The optimization stage leverages these insights; simulation tools can evaluate the potential impact of proposed changes before implementation, facilitating continuous improvement and ensuring processes remain aligned with organizational goals and performance targets [4,40]. This closed-loop approach, moving from monitoring and analysis to targeted optimization and corrective action, is key to maintaining process health and achieving desired outcomes [15].​  

# 6.2 Methodologies and Frameworks for Process Optimization  

Business process optimization commonly employs various project management methodologies to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. Among the prominent approaches are Total Quality Management (TQM), Six Sigma, and Lean, each offering distinct principles and focus areas [14,28]. While sharing the overarching goal of improving processes, these methodologies differ in their primary emphasis and mechanisms for achieving optimization [28].  

Total Quality Management (TQM) is characterized as a framework demanding organization-wide dedication to continuous improvement over an extended period, with a focus on refining workflows to elevate the quality of goods and services provided to customers [28]. TQM specifically targets the reduction of defective products or suboptimal service by concentrating efforts on individual departments and setting quantifiable goals to boost customer satisfaction [14]. Its strength lies in fostering a pervasive quality consciousness across the entire organization [28].  

Six Sigma, conversely, operates as a project management methodology aimed at standardizing workflows to significantly amplify operational efficiency [28]. It follows a structured approach, typically the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) model, for optimizing business processes [28]. A key impact of Six Sigma is its emphasis on continuous improvement, cultivating a culture centered on ongoing enhancement within the workforce [14].  

The Lean methodology is fundamentally a business philosophy centered on optimizing practices primarily through the elimination of waste [28]. This involves scrutinizing processes to identify and remove steps that do not add value, where value is determined strictly by customer willingness to pay [14]. Lean's strength lies in streamlining operations by retaining only value-adding activities, thereby directly impacting operational efficiency by minimizing non-essential steps [14,28].  

Comparing these methodologies, TQM places quality at the forefront, aiming for broad organizational involvement to reduce defects and enhance customer satisfaction [14,28]. Six Sigma focuses on reducing variation and standardizing processes to improve efficiency and build a culture of continuous improvement [14,28]. Lean prioritizes the identification and elimination of waste to optimize flow and efficiency from a customer value perspective [14,28]. While TQM impacts customer satisfaction through quality improvement and Six Sigma through process consistency, Lean affects customer satisfaction by ensuring only valuable steps remain [14]. Workforce culture is influenced by Six Sigma's drive for continuous improvement and TQM's organization-wide involvement [14,28]. Operational efficiency is a primary outcome of both Six Sigma's standardization and Lean's waste elimination [14,28]. Systems like ADONIS are noted to support methodologies like Lean and Kaizen (a concept often aligned with continuous improvement principles like CIP) [12], highlighting the practical application of these frameworks within BPM tools. Understanding the core principles, objectives, and potential measurable results of each methodology is crucial for selecting the most appropriate approach for specific optimization goals [6,16,28,30].​  

# 6.3 Steps in Business Process Optimization and Continuous Improvement  

Business Process Management (BPM) fundamentally involves the iterative management of business processes to achieve organizational goals. Within the BPM lifecycle, Business Process Optimization (BPO) represents a crucial phase focused on enhancing process efficiency and effectiveness [3,26,31]. It integrates into the ongoing cycle of process design, modeling, execution, monitoring, and continuous improvement. The primary objective of BPO is to identify and eliminate inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and non-value-adding activities to streamline operations and improve performance [26,28,31].  

Several frameworks outline the steps involved in Business Process Optimization, sharing common core activities. A widely recognized approach comprises five phases [14]: (1) defining the current process, (2) analyzing the current process, (3) redesigning the process, (4) implementing the optimized process, and (5) evaluating the results. Similarly, the Six Sigma DMAIC model offers a structured methodology with Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control phases [28]. Another perspective, particularly relevant in the context of process mining, outlines steps such as connecting to IT systems, visualizing process models, analyzing for weak spots, optimizing through simulation, and monitoring performance against KPIs [40].​  

The initial step, defining the current process, involves gaining a comprehensive understanding of how the process operates. This often utilizes tools such as business process mapping software to visualize workflows and identify key activities and stakeholders [14]. Following definition, the analysis phase focuses on identifying issues, inefficiencies, and performance gaps. This includes pinpointing bottlenecks, redundant tasks, and deviations from desired performance levels by analyzing process data and comparing actual performance against objectives [14,26,31]. Tools like process intelligence and process mining are instrumental in this phase, allowing for the automatic monitoring and discovery of processes to uncover root  

causes of delays and inefficiencies [4,15,30]. Process mining, for instance, analyzes event logs from IT systems to provide objective insights into process execution [40].  

The redesign phase is critical for developing the optimized process. This involves defining the scope of changes, conducting a risk analysis, and crucially, consulting with employees who perform the process daily [14,26]. Soliciting feedback from those involved is essential for practical and effective redesign [12,26]. Solutions implemented may include removing redundancies, automating tasks, or restructuring workflows [28,31]. Methodologies like Lean provide principles for identifying and eliminating waste, further guiding the redesign process [28].  

Implementation involves deploying the redesigned process. A common strategy is to start with a small-scale rollout to test the changes and then scale up if successful [14]. The final phase, evaluation or control, necessitates documenting lessons learned and identifying necessary adjustments [14]. The Six Sigma approach emphasizes the "Control" phase to ensure implemented changes are sustained over time by comparing baseline and post-optimization metrics [28].  

Beyond these distinct steps, the continuous monitoring and improvement of processes are paramount in BPM [9,31]. This ongoing effort ensures that processes remain aligned with evolving business needs and technological advancements [9,15]. Tools like ADONIS facilitate collecting feedback and empowering organizations for continuous improvement [12]. Process intelligence systems support this by providing near-real-time performance monitoring and ongoing discovery to identify areas for remediation and service enhancement [30,35]. Process mining enables continuous observation to determine process effectiveness and guide ongoing optimization efforts [4]. While AI-enabled process optimization is transforming the landscape [1], maintaining human control and oversight is crucial to prevent undesirable outcomes or optimization towards local optima [18]. Utilizing key performance indicators (KPIs) is fundamental to continuously monitor process performance against objectives and drive further improvements [31,40]. This cyclical nature of monitoring, evaluating, and adjusting underscores that BPO is not a one-time project but an integral, ongoing activity within effective BPM [9,31].  

# 7. Benefits and Value Proposition of BPM Systems  

Business Process Management (BPM) systems deliver a comprehensive array of benefits and a compelling value proposition for organizations seeking to enhance their operational performance and achieve strategic objectives [3,9,15,29,32].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Category</td><td>Examples of Benefits</td><td>Key Metrics/Indicators</td></tr><tr><td>Quantifiable</td><td>Cost Reduction, Increased Efficiency/Productivity, Faster Cycle Times/Speed, Quality Improvement, Error Reduction</td><td>Operational Costs,Labor Costs, Cycle Time, Throughput, Error Rate, Rework, Financial Savings (AR/AP)</td></tr><tr><td>Intangible</td><td>Enhanced Customer Satisfaction/Experience, Improved Compliance/Risk Management, Increased Business Agility/Adaptability, Better Visibility/Decision-Making, Optimized Resource Utilization</td><td>Customer Satisfaction Scores, Compliance Incidents, Time to Adapt, Process Transparency, Resource Allocation</td></tr></table></body></html>  

These advantages span across various facets of organizational activity and can be broadly categorized into tangible, quantifiable outcomes and crucial, albeit often intangible, strategic advantages [26,28,31]. The effective implementation of BPM systems serves as a core engine for digital transformation, enabling organizations to remodel their operations, improve competitiveness, and facilitate sustainable development [3,8,15,22,36,44].  

Quantifiable benefits demonstrate a direct, measurable impact on operational and financial metrics [3,25]. A primary outcome is significant cost reduction, achieved through eliminating waste and redundancies, optimizing resource allocation, automating tasks, and reducing operational expenses [22,25,26,28,31,38]. Empirical evidence underscores these savings, with reported examples including  

​3.4millionrecoveredinoverdueservicecontracts, €66Msavedthroughoptimizedprocesses, 35M in annualized working capital benefits, millions unlocked in Accounts Receivable, and a $9 6 \%$ cash discount rate [2,32,36,40]. Further quantification includes savings of ​10Mbyreducingprocessingtime, 13M through improved workforce utilization, and $\$ 18M$ annually through automation [35].​  

Improvements in efficiency and productivity represent another critical quantifiable benefit

This case highlights the potential of BPMS, or related management systems like BMS, to drive improvements in core business functions impacting both efficiency (cost reduction) and effectiveness (customer satisfaction, revenue).​  

Several other prominent organizations across diverse sectors have reported successful outcomes through the strategic use of BPMS tools, particularly those incorporating advanced process intelligence capabilities like process mining. Accenture, PepsiCo, Deutsche Telekom Services Europe, and OMES are cited as examples of organizations that leveraged Celonis, a process mining tool, to achieve quantifiable benefits [32,36]. Similarly, Sysmex and Deutsche Telekom specifically detailed processes improved and benefits realized via Celonis process mining implementations [2]. NextEra has utilized process  

insights to guide its transformation roadmap, indicating the use of BPMS-related intelligence for strategic initiatives, while Westpac has adopted AI-Driven Process Intelligence, suggesting a focus on leveraging cutting-edge technology for deeper process understanding and optimization [40].​  

Comparing these cases reveals both common strategies and varied applications. A recurring theme is the focus on gaining deep insights into actual process execution, often through data-driven approaches like process mining [2,32]. This contrasts with traditional, potentially more static, process modeling methods. The benefits reported are consistently tied to improved efficiency (e.g., cost reduction, faster cycle times) and enhanced effectiveness (e.g., improved customer satisfaction, strategic wins). The retail case study demonstrates benefits in supply chain efficiency (inventory costs) and CRM effectiveness (satisfaction, sales) [9]. The Celonis-focused cases emphasize quantifiable operational benefits across various processes [2,32,36]. The NextEra and Westpac examples highlight the strategic application of process intelligence for broader transformation and AI integration [40].​  

The impact on organizational performance is often measured through a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. Quantifiable metrics include reduced costs (e.g., inventory, operational), increased revenue (sales), faster process cycle times, and other specific operational key performance indicators (KPIs) that are improved through process optimization [9,32,36]. Qualitative metrics encompass areas like improved customer satisfaction [9], enhanced employee experience, or better strategic alignment [40]. Success factors common to these implementations appear to include a clear focus on specific, high-impact processes, leveraging data and process intelligence for evidence-based decision-making, and a commitment to measuring and achieving tangible benefits.  

Generalizable lessons and best practices can be drawn from these successful cases. Organizations considering BPMS implementation should first identify specific business processes that are critical, inefficient, or bottlenecks [9]. Leveraging process intelligence tools, such as process mining, can provide essential data-driven insights into how processes are actualy executed, revealing deviations and inefficiencies that might not be apparent through traditional mapping methods [2,32,40]. Setting clear, measurable objectives, both quantitative and qualitative, is crucial for demonstrating the value of the BPMS investment [36]. Finally, integrating process insights into broader strategic transformation initiatives or leveraging advanced capabilities like AI can yield more profound and sustained organizational impact [40].

Ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, especially within complex domains like finance, relies on BPM's ability for real-time monitoring of process execution and detection of violations [6,15,35]. Finally, integrating the management of organizational intellectual capital within BPM frameworks presents challenges related to capturing and leveraging knowledge embedded in processes, requiring strategies for visualizing knowledge value pathways and defining strategic KPIs [17]. Successfully navigating this multifaceted landscape of challenges through targeted strategies, such as robust change management, improved technical integration methods, stringent data governance, and alignment with strategic goals, is paramount for realizing the full potential of BPM in driving operational excellence and achieving desired organizational outcomes.​  

# 10.1 Technical and Integration Challenges  

Implementing and managing Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) within complex organizational contexts presents significant technical and integration challenges. A primary hurdle involves the integration of BPMS with existing, often disparate, enterprise systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platforms [6,16]. Ensuring seamless data flow and establishing robust connections with the existing IT infrastructure and other business applications are critical, yet frequently cited as technical difficulties [6,9,16].  

The complexity inherent in managing intricate business processes further exacerbates these technical issues, requiring BPMS to handle diverse operational workflows and data structures [6,16]. A key challenge identified in the literature is ensuring interoperability between different systems [6,16]. This necessitates sophisticated data integration strategies to harmonize information exchange and maintain consistency across integrated platforms.  

Furthermore, current BPMS tools often exhibit limitations. Some studies note that these tools were primarily designed for process automation rather than comprehensive business analysis [19]. This can create a disconnect between the analytical phase, where business analysts design processes using specialized tools, and the execution phase within the BPMS. Ideally, there would be a seamless transfer, perhaps facilitated by standards like Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), to export processes from analysis tools to the BPMS for execution [19]. However, achieving this seamless transition and ensuring accurate capture of current processes as a prerequisite for defining future states remains a challenge [19].  

Vendors are actively addressing these integration challenges. Some emphasize their systems' capability to integrate with customers' existing infrastructure, such as 奥哲H3 BPM [34]. Innovative approaches, like Skan AI's offer of "zero-integration", aim to bypass time-consuming and costly data engineering typically associated with integration, promising rapid  

implementation and quicker realization of value [35]. Despite these efforts, the need for robust strategies to improve data integration, enhance interoperability, and potentially leverage standards and frameworks to reduce complexity remains a critical area of focus for advancing BPMS capabilities and facilitating their broader adoption and effectiveness in organizational contexts.

A primary challenge identified is resistance to change, which poses a significant risk to implementation success [6,9,16,25]. Effectively managing employee expectations and addressing this resistance are crucial steps for ensuring a smooth transition to new processes and systems [9].​  

Beyond resistance, other significant hurdles include a pervasive lack of executive or senior management support, which can severely hamper project progress and adoption [6,16,19]. Indeed, the absence of strong senior management backing is considered detrimental, particularly minimizing the chances of success in foundational activities like business-process discovery [19].  

Additional challenges highlighted in the literature encompass inadequate skills among staff to effectively utilize or manage the new systems and processes, insufficient allocation of resources (both human and financial), and potential misalignment between the BPM initiative and overarching business goals [6,16]. The influence of organizational culture also plays a critical role, as a culture resistant to change or innovation can impede the successful integration and adoption of BPM technologies [6,16].​  

Overcoming these multifarious challenges necessitates the application of robust change management strategies and effective stakeholder engagement techniques [25]. Practical advice for successful implementation often emphasizes proactive communication, training programs to address skill gaps, careful resource planning, and ensuring clear alignment with strategic objectives [40]. Engaging stakeholders at all levels, from senior leadership to frontline employees, is paramount for building consensus, fostering support, and mitigating resistance throughout the implementation lifecycle.  

# 10.3 Data, Security, and Compliance Challenges  

Ensuring the successful implementation and operation of Business Process Management Systems, particularly initiatives like process mining, is fundamentally challenged by issues related to data quality and governance. Poor data quality, characterized by inaccuracies, inconsistencies, or incompleteness, can significantly distort process models and insights derived from process mining efforts, thus undermining their efficacy [6,16]. Effective data governance frameworks are therefore crucial to ensure data integrity, maintain data lineage, and standardize data inputs from disparate systems [6,16].  

Beyond data management, security poses a substantial challenge, particularly in cloud-based BPMS environments where sensitive business data is processed and stored [6,16]. Protecting against unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyberattacks requires robust security protocols. Mitigation strategies include adopting a privacy-first security architecture, implementing strong encryption, adhering to privacy-by-design principles, and integrating ethical considerations into AI components [35].​  

A critical function of BPM is its role in ensuring accuracy, transparency, and compliance with regulatory requirements, especially within the complex domain of financial regulations [6]. BPMS and process mining tools facilitate stringent compliance checks by enabling real-time monitoring of process execution, detection of violations or bottlenecks, and analysis of root causes [15,35]. This capability allows organizations to conduct fact-based compliance audits and proactively address deviations, thereby driving process integrity and ensuring adherence to established standards and regulations [15,35].​  

# 10.4 Managing Intellectual Capital with BPM Systems  

The effective management of organizational knowledge assets and intellectual capital (IC) is increasingly recognized as critical for establishing and sustaining competitive advantage. These intangible assets underpin key organizational capabilities and core competencies [17]. Consequently, the accurate measurement and strategic utilization of IC are paramount for demonstrating value creation and guiding strategic decisions [17].  

Business Process Management (BPM) systems offer a structured approach that can be strategically aligned with knowledge management initiatives to enhance IC. By standardizing, optimizing, and automating business processes, BPM can facilitate the capture, storage, dissemination, and application of organizational knowledge embedded within workflows. This integration allows for the transformation of tacit and explicit knowledge into actionable insights and repeatable practices, thereby enhancing the organization's IC.​  

A key aspect of managing IC through BPM involves visualizing the value pathways of knowledge assets [17]. This entails mapping how specific knowledge assets contribute to process performance and ultimately to organizational outcomes. Tools such as knowledge asset maps and dashboards are proposed to support this visualization and management process [17]. Furthermore, designing strategic Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is essential not only for monitoring the state of IC but also for testing assumed causal relationships between specific knowledge investments, process improvements, and desired business results [17]. Such data-driven approaches, facilitated by integrated BPM and KM strategies, enable organizations to gain deeper insights into the impact of their IC on performance and refine their strategies accordingly.

Large Language Models (LLMs), a subset of AI, are being applied to manage and generate process knowledge by converting unstructured information into actionable specifications and queries tailored to specific process contexts [18]. For AI to be effectively leveraged in BPM, it requires  

robust underlying data and business context, often provided by process intelligence platforms [36]. While presenting numerous opportunities, the integration of AI into BPM also introduces potential challenges that organizations must navigate [6].  

Alongside AI, low-code and no-code platforms are becoming central to future BPMS capabilities [6,35]. These platforms emphasize visual development environments, minimizing the need for traditional coding and enabling faster application and process development [15]. A key benefit of this trend is the promotion of citizen development, allowing business users with limited technical expertise to contribute directly to automating and improving processes, thereby increasing organizational agility and potentially reducing development costs.  

Hyperautomation—a concept encompassing the application of multiple technologies like Robotic Process Automation (RPA), AI, ML, and other tools to automate business processes—is also a defining trend [35]. RPA, often considered a component of hyperautomation, focuses on automating repetitive, rule-based tasks typically performed by humans [6]. By combining RPA with AI and ML, hyperautomation aims to automate more complex, end-to-end processes that require cognitive capabilities. This integrated approach allows organizations to automate a wider range of activities, moving beyond simple task automation to achieve comprehensive process transformation.​  

Collectively, these emerging technologies are addressing limitations of traditional BPMS by enhancing capabilities in process discovery, analysis, automation, and optimization. Low-code/no-code empowers faster development and broader participation, while hyperautomation enables more extensive and intelligent automation. AI provides the intelligence layer necessary for prescriptive insights, autonomous actions via agentic systems, and the ability to derive structure from unstructured data using LLMs. Other related emerging technologies like Digital Twins are also relevant, offering virtual representations of processes or operations to facilitate analysis and simulation [15,40]. By integrating these advancements, future BPMS are expected to offer greater flexibility, intelligence, and accessibility—significantly shaping the field and enabling organizations to achieve higher levels of operational excellence and digital transformation [6].​  

# 12.2 Evolution of BPM Practices and Concepts  

The landscape of Business Process Management (BPM) is undergoing significant evolution, driven by technological advancements and the imperative for organizations to enhance agility, efficiency, and innovation within their processes [10]. This transformation is creating new opportunities and reshaping the core practices of BPM [40].  

A prominent trend is the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into BPM, signaling a shift from traditional rule-driven processes towards a more cognitive evolution [6]. Concepts such as Agentic Workflow, potentially related to technologies like Agentforce, are emerging to empower teams and transform service delivery mechanisms, enabling more effective ways of working [6,40].​  

Integral to this evolution is the rise of next-level Process Intelligence, coupled with advanced process modeling and process mining techniques [32]. Process intelligence, often integrated with real-time analytics, is crucial for streamlining and optimizing business processes, making modern enterprise processes smarter and more efficient [24,36]. This is further supported by a move towards more agile and responsive BPM practices, enabled by advanced monitoring capabilities and the extraction of predictive insights from process data [15].  

The development and application of Digital Twins within BPM platforms also represent a significant future direction [12]. Digital twins allow for the simulation, monitoring, and optimization of processes in a virtual environment before implementation or in real-time, offering capabilities for proactive identification of bottlenecks and performance improvements.  

Furthermore, the approach to process modeling itself is evolving. There is a suggestion that the emphasis on rigid, imperative models might diminish in favor of more flexible collections of declarative constraints. These constraints could potentially be auto-tailored and assembled on demand for modeling and analysis purposes, facilitated by technologies like Generative AI [18]. Despite this potential shift, established standards like Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) remain critical. BPMN serves as a global standard for process modeling, facilitating business-IT alignment and supporting the technical implementation of processes in the context of digital transformation [29]. Similarly, Decision Modeling Notation (DMN) provides a standard language for modeling repeatable business decisions, often complementing BPMN to enable the full automation of processes that involve complex business rules [29]. The continued relevance and evolution in the application of these standards highlight their role in building the foundation for advanced BPM practices.  

Other key areas of innovation include Extreme Collaboration, focusing on building relationships across organizational boundaries to enhance communication and teamwork [24], and the integration of data-driven sustainability efforts into BPM [15]. These trends collectively position business transformation not as a discrete project but as a continuous and ongoing process [1]. By embracing these evolving practices, organizations can leverage BPM systems to achieve greater operational excellence, adapt more rapidly to market changes, and drive innovation [10,40].​  

# 12.3 Research Gaps and Future Research Directions  

Despite the significant advancements in Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) research, several gaps persist, necessitating focused investigation in future studies. A critical area for future research involves exploring the broader organizational impacts of BPM adoption, such as its influence on employee engagement and the ethical considerations surrounding the increasing deployment of AI-powered BPM solutions [25].  

Technological development within the BPM field also presents fertile ground for future work. Specific avenues include the development of more sophisticated techniques for process mining and the seamless integration of BPM with other enterprise systems to enhance overall organizational efficiency and data flow [40].  

Furthermore, research into BPMS, particularly concerning the integration of generative artificial intelligence, reveals specific technical challenges that require attention [18]. Future research should aim to define rigid evaluation metrics tailored for the generative AI-supported creation of process models and queries. Specifying LLM-friendly data exchange formats is another crucial task to facilitate interoperability and usability. Additionally, a thorough assessment of the potential benefits and limitations of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for BPM tasks is essential to harness their full capabilities effectively [18].​  

The existing literature also broadly acknowledges limitations and indicates numerous potential avenues for future research in both BPM and BPMS, underscoring the dynamic nature of the field [6,16].  

A comprehensive framework for future research could integrate diverse perspectives on BPM, including technological, organizational, and human-centric views, to address the multifaceted challenges and capitalize on the opportunities presented to organizations in the digital age.
