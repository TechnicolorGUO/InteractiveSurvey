# 2 Introduction
The increasing reliance on data-driven approaches across various domains has highlighted the critical role of high-quality datasets in advancing research and development. In the era of big data, the availability of well-curated, high-value datasets (HVDs) is essential for training robust machine learning models, conducting empirical studies, and driving innovation. These datasets not only provide the necessary raw material for developing and validating algorithms but also serve as a foundation for interdisciplinary research, enabling insights that span multiple fields. The importance of HVDs is further underscored by the growing demand for data-driven solutions in areas such as healthcare, finance, and environmental monitoring, where the accuracy and reliability of data can have significant implications for decision-making and policy formulation [1].

This survey paper focuses on the development and application of high-value datasets (HVDs) in the context of data-driven development. Specifically, we explore the creation, curation, and utilization of HVDs across a range of domains, including machine learning, security, user interaction, and domain-specific applications. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of HVDs, highlighting the methodologies and techniques used in their development, as well as the challenges and opportunities they present. By synthesizing findings from recent research, this survey offers insights into the best practices for creating and using HVDs, as well as the potential future directions for this field.

The paper begins by delving into the integration of generative models and user interaction, with a focus on Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) and their use of Generative Reward Models (GRMs) to enhance recommendation accuracy and user experience [2]. We then examine the automated collection and security analysis of software packages, particularly in the context of large-scale language models. This section discusses the methods used to gather and analyze open-source packages, construct dependency graphs, and identify vulnerabilities, emphasizing the importance of continuous monitoring and automated security analysis in maintaining the health of software ecosystems.

Next, we explore the application of textual coherent score distillation (TCSD) in text-to-3D generation, a technique that ensures the generated 3D content remains consistent with the input text [3]. This section details the view-aware data collection pipeline and the use of multi-modal large language models to guide the optimization process, leading to more accurate and reliable 3D models. We also discuss the empirical evaluation of AI supply chains, focusing on the performance of machine learning models in real-world scenarios, particularly in detecting and mitigating ransomware attacks and optimizing computational resources [4].

The paper then shifts to the domain of legal disputes, where case similarity labeling based on co-citation analysis is a critical component in the development of legal recommender systems [5]. This section examines the challenges of defining and measuring similarity in legal texts and the use of advanced natural language processing techniques to enhance the accuracy of similarity labeling [5]. Additionally, we explore the use of activation probing techniques in understanding and interpreting the internal representations of deep learning models, with a focus on domain-specific named entity recognition (NER) for pharmaceutical manufacturing and the cross-lingual speech chain-of-thought framework for enhancing instruction-following in low-resource languages.

Finally, the paper discusses the contributions of this survey. By providing a detailed overview of the methodologies and techniques used in the development and application of HVDs, this survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners. It highlights the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in creating and utilizing HVDs and identifies key areas for future research, such as the development of more efficient and adaptive models, the integration of real-time data, and the enhancement of data security and privacy [1]. The survey also emphasizes the need for continued collaboration between data scientists, domain experts, and policymakers to ensure that HVDs are accessible, reliable, and beneficial to a wide range of stakeholders [1].

# 3 Machine Learning and Data Analysis for Security and User Interaction

## 3.1 Generative Models and User Interaction

### 3.1.1 Generative Reward Models for CRSs
Generative Reward Models (GRMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing the performance of Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) by providing nuanced and continuous feedback during the recommendation process [2]. These models are designed to simulate user preferences and behaviors, thereby enabling CRSs to refine their recommendations iteratively. The core idea behind GRMs is to generate reward signals that reflect the quality of recommended items and the alignment with user preferences, without the need for explicit labels. This is particularly advantageous in scenarios where user feedback is sparse or unreliable, as GRMs can synthesize feedback based on learned patterns and user interactions.

In the context of CRSs, GRMs are typically integrated into the recommendation loop to provide both coarse-grained and fine-grained feedback. Coarse-grained feedback, such as generative item scoring, involves assigning a score to recommended items based on their perceived relevance and appeal to the user. This score is generated by the GRM, which has been trained on historical user interactions and preferences. Fine-grained feedback, on the other hand, involves attribute-based item critiquing, where the GRM provides specific critiques or suggestions for improvement regarding particular attributes of the recommended items. For example, if a user is looking for a movie recommendation, the GRM might critique the genre, director, or cast of a suggested film, helping the CRS to refine its recommendations more precisely.

The development of GRMs for CRSs leverages advances in generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which are capable of generating high-quality synthetic data. These models are trained to understand the complex dynamics of user-item interactions, allowing them to generate realistic and informative feedback. The integration of GRMs into CRSs not only improves the accuracy and personalization of recommendations but also enhances the overall user experience by making the recommendation process more interactive and responsive. By continuously refining recommendations based on synthesized feedback, GRMs enable CRSs to adapt to changing user preferences and provide more relevant and satisfying recommendations over time.

### 3.1.2 Automated Package Collection and Security Analysis
Automated package collection and security analysis are critical components in ensuring the integrity and reliability of software ecosystems, particularly in the context of large-scale language models and their supporting infrastructure. The process begins with the systematic gathering of open-source packages from repositories such as PyPI and NPM. This is achieved through a combination of keyword-based searches and heuristic filtering techniques, which help in identifying and curating a comprehensive dataset of relevant packages. In our study, we employed an automated pipeline to collect and filter 44,303 packages, resulting in a curated dataset of 15,725 LLM-related packages across 14 functional domains [6]. Each package was analyzed for metadata and README files, providing a rich source of information for subsequent analysis.

The next step involves the construction of a directed graph to model the dependency relationships among the collected packages [6]. This graph, comprising 15,725 nodes and 10,402 edges, offers a visual and analytical representation of the ecosystem's structure. By examining the graph, we can identify key packages that serve as central hubs, as well as those that are more peripheral. This structural analysis is crucial for understanding the propagation of vulnerabilities and the potential impact of security breaches. For instance, a vulnerability in a widely-used dependency can have cascading effects, affecting numerous downstream packages and applications.

Finally, the security analysis phase focuses on identifying and characterizing vulnerabilities within the collected packages. We assembled a dataset of 180 vulnerability reports, which were cross-referenced with the curated package dataset to assess the prevalence and nature of security issues [6]. Our analysis revealed that common vulnerabilities include improper input validation, insecure deserialization, and insufficient access controls. These findings underscore the importance of continuous monitoring and automated security analysis in maintaining the health and security of the LLM software ecosystem. By integrating automated collection and analysis processes, we can proactively identify and mitigate risks, enhancing the overall resilience of the system.

### 3.1.3 Textual Coherent Score Distillation for 3D Generation
Textual Coherent Score Distillation (TCSD) represents a significant advancement in the field of text-to-3D generation, addressing the challenge of maintaining textual consistency across different views of a 3D object [3]. Unlike traditional Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) methods, which often suffer from per-view bias accumulation and can result in the omission of objects, TCSD incorporates feedback from Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to guide the optimization process. This ensures that the generated 3D content remains coherent with the text input, even when viewed from multiple angles.

The TCSD framework is built on a view-aware data collection pipeline, which is crucial for training the 3DLLaVA-CRITIC, a model fine-tuned to provide accurate feedback on the alignment between text and 3D representations. This pipeline involves collecting 3D data from various viewpoints and associating each view with the corresponding text description. The 3DLLaVA-CRITIC is then trained to evaluate the coherence between the text and the 3D content, ensuring that the generated 3D models not only match the text but also maintain consistency across different views. This approach significantly reduces the per-view bias that can accumulate during the generation process, leading to more accurate and reliable 3D models.

To validate the effectiveness of TCSD, extensive experiments have been conducted on a variety of text-to-3D generation tasks. The results demonstrate that TCSD outperforms existing methods in terms of both textual coherence and visual quality. The CoherenDream benchmark, established as part of this research, showcases the capabilities of TCSD in generating 3D content that is not only visually appealing but also semantically aligned with the input text. This makes TCSD a promising technique for applications in gaming, virtual reality, and robotics, where text-coherent 3D generation is essential for creating immersive and realistic environments.

## 3.2 Empirical Studies and Data Collection

### 3.2.1 Semi-Structured Interviews for HVD Opening
In the context of High Value Datasets (HVD) opening in Taiwan, semi-structured interviews were conducted to gather empirical insights from key stakeholders. The interviews involved four ministries: the Ministry of Digital Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the Department of Statistics, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and the Ministry of Environment, Department of Monitoring and Information. These ministries were chosen due to their extensive experience in implementing open data policies and their direct involvement in the HVD opening process [1]. The semi-structured interview format was selected to allow for flexibility and depth in exploring the unique challenges and strategies employed by each ministry.

The technical perspective of the interviews focused on two primary areas: (1) the methods and channels used to assess needs when selecting HVD, and (2) the specific requirements for HVD compared to general open data. The first area explored how ministries determine which datasets should be prioritized for opening, including the criteria and processes used to evaluate the potential impact and value of the data. The second area delved into the technical requirements and standards that must be met for HVD, such as data quality, granularity, update frequency, and integration methods. This distinction is crucial, as HVD often requires higher standards and more rigorous validation processes to ensure its utility and reliability.

The interviews also sought to understand the level of support and resources provided by public agencies to facilitate the HVD opening process. This included examining the availability of technical assistance, funding, and policy guidance. The insights gained from these interviews are expected to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of HVD opening in Taiwan, highlighting both the successes and the challenges faced by the participating ministries [1]. This information will be crucial for developing more effective strategies and policies to enhance the openness and accessibility of high-value datasets.

### 3.2.2 Empirical Evaluation of AI Supply Chains
In the empirical evaluation of AI supply chains, the focus is on assessing the practical implications and performance of machine learning models when deployed across different stages of the supply chain [4]. This section delves into the methodologies and findings from empirical studies that evaluate the effectiveness of AI models in real-world scenarios, particularly in the context of security and efficiency. The evaluation encompasses a range of metrics, including accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness against adversarial attacks, which are crucial for ensuring the reliability and security of AI systems in operational environments.

One key aspect of the empirical evaluation is the assessment of machine learning models' ability to detect and mitigate ransomware attacks during the encryption phase [7]. Studies have shown that while traditional static analysis tools and user behavior analytics can be effective, they often suffer from high false positive rates and are easily evaded by sophisticated ransomware. Machine learning models, when trained on a diverse set of malware samples, can offer more accurate detection but still struggle with zero-day attacks. To address this, researchers have explored the development of adaptive strategies that dynamically adjust alert thresholds based on evolving data patterns, thereby improving the responsiveness and accuracy of the detection systems.

Additionally, the empirical evaluation highlights the importance of optimizing computational resources in AI supply chains [4]. Machine learning models, especially those used in real-time applications, require significant CPU and memory resources, which can be a bottleneck in resource-constrained environments. Empirical studies have investigated various techniques to reduce computational costs, such as model pruning, quantization, and the use of lightweight architectures. These optimizations not only enhance the efficiency of the models but also make them more scalable and deployable in a wider range of settings, from edge devices to cloud infrastructure. The results from these studies provide valuable insights into the trade-offs between model complexity, performance, and resource consumption, guiding the design of more efficient AI systems.

### 3.2.3 Case Similarity Labeling for Legal Disputes
Case similarity labeling in the context of legal disputes is a critical component in the development of legal recommender systems, particularly in specialized areas such as labor disputes [5]. The primary challenge in this domain is the precise definition and measurement of similarity, which often requires a deep understanding of legal nuances and domain-specific language. Traditional approaches to similarity labeling, such as keyword matching or simple text similarity metrics, often fall short due to the complex and context-dependent nature of legal texts. Therefore, more sophisticated methods are needed to capture the subtleties of legal reasoning and argumentation.

One effective approach to addressing these challenges is through the use of co-citation analysis, where the co-citation of legal articles in past cases is used as a proxy for similarity [5]. This method leverages the implicit relationships between legal texts, as legal professionals often cite similar articles and cases when making similar arguments. By constructing a co-citation network, researchers can identify clusters of cases that are semantically and legally similar, even if the textual overlap is minimal [5]. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of similarity labeling but also provides a more robust and interpretable basis for legal recommendations.

To further refine the co-citation-based similarity labeling, advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be employed to extract and analyze the semantic content of legal texts. Techniques such as named entity recognition (NER) and part-of-speech (POS) tagging can help in identifying key legal concepts and entities, which are then used to enrich the co-citation network. Additionally, machine learning models, particularly those based on deep learning, can be trained on annotated datasets to predict similarity scores between cases. These models can incorporate both the co-citation information and the semantic features extracted from the text, leading to a more comprehensive and accurate similarity labeling system.

## 3.3 NLP and Information Extraction

### 3.3.1 Activation Probing Techniques
Activation probing techniques have emerged as a crucial tool for understanding and interpreting the internal representations of deep learning models, particularly in the context of neural networks. These techniques involve analyzing the activations of neurons or layers within a model to gain insights into the model's decision-making process. One of the primary methods is raw activation probing, which directly examines the raw outputs of neurons without any preprocessing. This approach is straightforward but can be limited in its ability to capture complex patterns and relationships within the data. Despite these limitations, raw activation probing remains a valuable baseline for comparison with more sophisticated techniques [8].

Prompted activation probing builds upon raw activation probing by incorporating additional context or guidance through prompts. This method leverages the model's ability to respond to specific inputs, such as natural language instructions, to generate more meaningful and task-relevant activations. By providing prompts, researchers can steer the model's focus towards specific features or aspects of the input data, thereby enhancing the interpretability and utility of the activations. Studies have shown that prompted activation probing can significantly improve the performance of downstream tasks, especially in scenarios with limited training data or distribution shifts between training and test sets [8].

To further refine activation probing techniques, researchers have explored the use of max-pooled activations and self-attention mechanisms. Max-pooled activation probing involves aggregating the maximum values of activations across different neurons or layers, which can help in identifying the most salient features contributing to the model's decisions. Self-attention mechanisms, on the other hand, enable the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input, providing a more nuanced understanding of the model's internal representations. These advanced techniques have been shown to outperform raw and prompted activation probing in various benchmarks, highlighting their potential for enhancing the interpretability and robustness of deep learning models.

### 3.3.2 Domain-Specific NER for Pharmaceutical Manufacturing
Domain-Specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) for pharmaceutical manufacturing is a critical component in the automated extraction and analysis of data from unstructured texts, such as patents, research papers, and manufacturing reports. Unlike general NER models, which are trained on a wide range of text types and may not capture the specific terminologies and context of pharmaceutical processes, domain-specific NER models are tailored to identify and classify entities relevant to the pharmaceutical industry, such as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), drug products, and manufacturing processes. These models are essential for tasks such as drug product fabrication data mining, where the ability to accurately extract information about the synthesis and formulation of drugs is crucial for quality control and regulatory compliance.

To address the unique challenges of pharmaceutical manufacturing, domain-specific NER models must be capable of handling both primary and secondary processing data [9]. Primary processing involves the synthesis of APIs, while secondary processing focuses on the formulation and manufacturing of drug products. Current NER models are predominantly designed for primary processing data extraction, which leaves a significant gap in the ability to mine data from secondary processing. This gap necessitates the development of more comprehensive models that can effectively capture the nuances of both stages. Additionally, the efficiency of these models is a critical consideration, as the volume of data in pharmaceutical manufacturing can be vast, and real-time processing is often required to support decision-making and process optimization.

Efforts to enhance domain-specific NER for pharmaceutical manufacturing have included the integration of specialized tools and techniques. For instance, relevant section selectors can help in identifying and isolating the parts of documents that contain the most relevant information, thereby reducing the computational load and improving the accuracy of entity recognition. Furthermore, the use of advanced machine learning algorithms, such as transformers and contextual embeddings, has shown promise in improving the performance of NER models in this domain. These models can better understand the context and relationships between entities, leading to more accurate and reliable data extraction. Future research should focus on developing and validating these models across a broader range of pharmaceutical manufacturing scenarios to ensure their robustness and applicability.

### 3.3.3 Cross-Lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought Framework
In the realm of speech instruction-following (SI), the Cross-lingual Speech Chain-of-Thought (XS-CoT) framework emerges as a novel approach to enhance the performance of Speech-Enabled Large Language Models (SLLMs) in low-resource and non-core languages [10]. Unlike traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which is predominantly applied to text-based tasks in high-resource languages, XS-CoT leverages a multi-step reasoning process to translate spoken commands from non-core languages into a core language (typically English) and then back into the original language [10]. This bidirectional translation process ensures that the reasoning capabilities of the model are effectively transferred across linguistic boundaries.

The XS-CoT framework operates by first converting the spoken command into text using automatic speech recognition (ASR). The text is then translated into English using a high-quality machine translation (MT) model, where a CoT prompt is applied to guide the reasoning process. The reasoning steps are generated in English, ensuring that the model can leverage its well-developed reasoning skills in a high-resource language. After the reasoning steps are completed, the final response is translated back into the original language using another MT model, and the resulting text is converted back into speech using text-to-speech (TTS) technology. This approach not only improves the accuracy of the response but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex reasoning tasks in low-resource languages.

Experimental evaluations of the XS-CoT framework on two state-of-the-art SLLMs, SALMONN and Qwen2Audio, have demonstrated significant improvements in response quality for non-core languages [10]. Specifically, the framework has shown a 45% relative improvement in response quality compared to direct supervised training methods. These results highlight the potential of XS-CoT in bridging the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages, thereby expanding the applicability of SLLMs in multilingual settings. The framework's effectiveness is attributed to its ability to leverage the robust reasoning capabilities of high-resource languages while maintaining the naturalness and fluency of the target language.

# 4 Bayesian and Simulation-Based Optimization Techniques

## 4.1 Temporal and Ensemble Optimization

### 4.1.1 Temporal Evaluation Framework for AI Generators
The temporal evaluation framework for AI generators is a critical component in assessing the evolving capabilities of generative models over time. This framework is designed to simulate real-world conditions where models are exposed to a continuous stream of new data and challenges, reflecting the dynamic nature of technological advancements in AI. By training models on a dataset of generators from an earlier time period and validating them on generators from a subsequent period, the framework ensures that the evaluation process remains relevant and challenging. This approach not only tests the model's ability to generalize to unseen data but also evaluates its capacity to adapt to the latest trends and techniques in generative AI.

In the temporal evaluation framework, the chronological order of generator releases plays a pivotal role. Models are incrementally trained by incorporating new generators while maintaining the historical sequence of their development. This incremental training process mimics the natural progression of AI technology, where new models build upon and improve the capabilities of their predecessors. By preserving the temporal order, the framework ensures that the evaluation is fair and representative of the actual challenges faced by AI systems in the real world. This method also helps in identifying the specific periods during which certain types of generators became more prevalent or influential, providing valuable insights into the evolution of generative AI.

The temporal evaluation framework is particularly useful in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of different generative models over time. By comparing the performance of models trained on older generators against those trained on newer ones, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to the success or failure of generative models. This framework also facilitates the development of more robust and adaptable models by highlighting areas where current approaches fall short. Ultimately, the temporal evaluation framework serves as a crucial tool for advancing the field of generative AI, ensuring that models remain effective and relevant in the face of rapid technological change.

### 4.1.2 Conflict-Averse Gradient Descent for MBO
Conflict-Averse Gradient Descent (CAGrad) is a method designed to address the challenges of multi-task optimization by mitigating conflicts among gradients from different tasks. Unlike traditional gradient descent methods that may lead to oscillatory behavior or poor convergence, CAGrad introduces a mechanism to align the gradients from multiple tasks, ensuring that the optimization process is more stable and efficient. This is particularly important in Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MBO) settings, where the goal is to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously, and the gradients from different objectives can often conflict with each other.

CAGrad achieves this alignment by formulating the gradient combination as a convex optimization problem. Specifically, it seeks to find a weighted sum of the gradients from each task that minimizes the conflict among them. The conflict is quantified using a metric that measures the discrepancy between the directions of the gradients. By minimizing this metric, CAGrad ensures that the combined gradient direction is more aligned with the overall optimization goals, leading to a more coherent and effective optimization process. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the tasks are not perfectly aligned and may have competing objectives, such as in material discovery, where multiple properties of a material (e.g., strength, conductivity, and cost) need to be optimized simultaneously.

In practice, CAGrad has been shown to outperform other gradient combination methods, such as Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA), in terms of both convergence speed and solution quality [11]. This is because CAGrad's conflict-averse formulation allows it to navigate the complex landscape of multi-objective optimization more effectively, avoiding regions where the gradients from different tasks are highly conflicting. As a result, CAGrad is a valuable tool for enhancing the performance of MBO algorithms, especially in applications where the objectives are diverse and the optimization landscape is challenging.

### 4.1.3 Multidimensional Precipitation Index Prediction
Multidimensional precipitation index prediction is a critical area of research due to the complex and multifaceted nature of precipitation data. Precipitation is influenced by a wide array of factors, including atmospheric circulation, temperature, humidity, and topographical features, which collectively contribute to its high-dimensional and non-linear characteristics. Traditional methods, such as statistical models and empirical approaches, often struggle to capture these intricate relationships, leading to limited accuracy and reliability in predictions. The advent of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques has opened new avenues for improving precipitation prediction by leveraging large datasets and advanced computational models [12].

Recent advancements in ML and DL have introduced hybrid models that combine the strengths of different approaches to address the challenges of multidimensional precipitation prediction [12]. For instance, the CNNLSTM hybrid framework has shown promising results by integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for capturing temporal dependencies. This combination allows the model to effectively handle the spatiotemporal nature of precipitation data, making it particularly suitable for forecasting in regions with complex topographies and varying climatic conditions. Additionally, the use of ensemble methods, such as gradient boosting and random forests, has further enhanced the robustness and accuracy of precipitation predictions by reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the field of multidimensional precipitation index prediction. One of the primary challenges is the availability and quality of data, as high-resolution and long-term precipitation datasets are often scarce and expensive to generate. Moreover, the dynamic and non-stationary nature of precipitation data requires models to be continually updated and refined to maintain their predictive accuracy [12]. Future research should focus on developing more efficient and adaptive models that can handle data scarcity and temporal variations, as well as integrating real-time data from multiple sources to enhance the timeliness and reliability of precipitation forecasts.

## 4.2 Federated and Domain-Aware Models

### 4.2.1 Federated Logistic Regression for Financial Data
Federated Logistic Regression (FLR) represents a compelling approach to address the challenges of data scarcity and privacy concerns in financial data analysis [13]. In the financial domain, data is often siloed across different institutions, each holding sensitive and proprietary information that cannot be freely shared. FLR enables collaborative model training without the need for data centralization, thereby mitigating privacy risks and legal barriers. The core of FLR lies in its ability to aggregate model updates from multiple participants, allowing each institution to contribute to the global model while retaining control over their data. This decentralized approach not only enhances data security but also improves the robustness and generalizability of the model by leveraging diverse data sources.

The implementation of FLR in finance involves several technical considerations to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. One of the primary challenges is the optimization of the logistic regression model in a federated setting. Unlike traditional centralized logistic regression, where all data is available in a single location, federated learning requires the development of algorithms that can handle distributed data and asynchronous updates [13]. Techniques such as secure aggregation and differential privacy are employed to protect the confidentiality of individual contributions while ensuring the accuracy of the aggregated model. Additionally, the choice of communication protocols and the frequency of model updates play a crucial role in balancing the trade-off between model performance and computational overhead.

Another significant aspect of FLR in finance is its interpretability, which is crucial for regulatory compliance and stakeholder trust. Logistic regression models are inherently interpretable, with coefficients that provide insights into the importance and direction of each feature. This transparency is particularly valuable in the financial sector, where decisions often require justification and auditability. FLR maintains this interpretability by preserving the structure of the logistic regression model, allowing financial analysts to understand and validate the model's predictions. Furthermore, the federated approach can enhance the model's fairness by reducing biases that might arise from data imbalances across different institutions, thereby contributing to more equitable and reliable financial decision-making.

### 4.2.2 Domain-Aware Neural System Models for AUVs
Domain-aware neural system models for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) represent a significant advancement in the integration of domain-specific knowledge into deep learning frameworks. These models leverage the inherent physical principles governing AUV dynamics to enhance the accuracy and reliability of predictions in data-scarce environments. By incorporating domain priors, such as hydrodynamic forces, propulsion characteristics, and sensor dynamics, these models can better generalize from limited training data, thereby improving their performance in real-world applications. The inclusion of domain knowledge not only aids in reducing the dependency on extensive labeled datasets but also enhances the interpretability of the model, making it easier to diagnose and correct errors.

In this section, we explore various domain-aware neural system models tailored for AUVs, ranging from blackbox models with minimal embedded physics to graybox models that integrate varying degrees of physical knowledge [14]. The vanilla Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) model serves as a baseline, where the system dynamics are learned entirely from data without explicit incorporation of physical laws [14]. However, this approach often suffers from poor generalization in scenarios where the training data does not adequately cover the operational envelope of the AUV. To address this, we introduce graybox models that augment the NODE framework with domain-specific constraints. For instance, by incorporating hydrodynamic drag equations or propeller thrust curves, these models can more accurately predict the behavior of the AUV under different environmental conditions, such as varying currents or depths.

Empirical analysis of these models reveals that the integration of domain priors significantly improves open-loop prediction performance, particularly in scenarios with sparse or noisy data. The results demonstrate that graybox models outperform their blackbox counterparts in terms of both accuracy and robustness. Additionally, the use of domain-aware priors facilitates faster convergence during training, reducing the computational cost and time required to achieve satisfactory performance. This section also discusses the challenges associated with balancing the complexity of the physical models with the flexibility of the neural network architecture, highlighting the importance of careful model design and validation.

### 4.2.3 K-Means Clustering for Market Order Analysis
K-Means clustering is a widely used unsupervised learning technique that partitions a dataset into a set of clusters, where each cluster consists of data points that are similar to each other and dissimilar to those in other clusters. In the context of market order analysis, K-Means clustering has been applied to identify distinct trading behaviors among market participants [15]. By leveraging one year of Market By Order (MBO) data for a selection of small-tick, medium-tick, and large-tick stocks, the K-Means++ algorithm is employed to segment daily MBO data into three clusters, representing directional, opportunistic, and market-making traders [15]. Each market order is characterized by six time-dependent features, capturing variations in execution behavior across different market conditions.

Directional traders are identified as those who execute informed trades with significant market impact, often based on private information or sophisticated analysis. Opportunistic traders, on the other hand, react to short-term market movements and arbitrage opportunities, executing trades to capitalize on temporary price discrepancies. Market-making traders engage in frequent buying and selling to provide liquidity, maintaining tight bid-ask spreads and facilitating smoother market operations. The clustering results provide insights into the trading dynamics and help in understanding the roles and behaviors of different market participants, which is crucial for regulatory oversight and market efficiency analysis.

The application of K-Means clustering in market order analysis not only aids in classifying trader types but also enhances the ability to monitor and predict market trends [15]. By identifying the dominant trading behaviors, market regulators can better understand the underlying forces driving market movements and implement more effective policies. Additionally, the clustering approach can be extended to include more granular features and longer time horizons, potentially revealing more nuanced patterns and improving the accuracy of market predictions. This method serves as a foundational tool for advanced market analysis, complementing other quantitative techniques and providing a structured framework for interpreting complex market data.

## 4.3 Bayesian and Probabilistic Methods

### 4.3.1 Psychological Theories in GAIL Models
Psychological theories, particularly those rooted in cognitive science and behavioral psychology, have been increasingly integrated into Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) models to enhance their performance and interpretability. One of the key psychological concepts leveraged in this context is the notion of 'surprise,' which is formalized through the discrepancy between prior and posterior beliefs [16]. This concept is inspired by the way humans and animals update their mental models in response to unexpected events, leading to more efficient learning and adaptation. By incorporating surprise into GAIL models, researchers aim to guide the learning process towards regions of the state space that offer the highest information gain, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize and adapt to new situations.

The integration of surprise in GAIL models is achieved through various metrics that quantify the degree to which new observations challenge existing beliefs. These metrics are designed to capture the extent of belief updating, which is crucial for active learning processes. However, traditional surprise metrics often neglect the reliability of the observations themselves, potentially leading to suboptimal learning outcomes. To address this limitation, Confidence-Aware Surprise (CAS) has been proposed, which incorporates model confidence into the evaluation of surprise [16]. This approach ensures that the impact of surprising outcomes is amplified in regions where the model is highly certain, while being discounted in uncertain regions [16]. By doing so, CAS helps to refine the learning process, making it more robust and efficient.

Empirical evaluations of GAIL models augmented with psychological theories, such as surprise and CAS, have demonstrated significant improvements in both the quality and interpretability of the generated activities. These models have been tested on a variety of real-world datasets, showing enhanced performance in terms of fidelity, utility, and interpretability [17]. The results indicate that integrating psychological theories can lead to more realistic and contextually appropriate simulations, which are essential for applications in areas such as autonomous systems, personalized recommendation, and behavioral modeling. Overall, the incorporation of psychological theories into GAIL models represents a promising direction for advancing the field of imitation learning and enhancing the capabilities of AI systems.

### 4.3.2 Scenario-Based Verification for Autonomous Systems
Scenario-based verification for autonomous systems is a method that decomposes the operational environment into manageable scenarios, each representing a specific set of conditions or tasks. This approach is particularly useful for systems with complex and dynamic environments, such as autonomous vehicles or drones, where traditional verification methods may be insufficient. By defining scenarios, such as driving in urban areas, navigating through rural roads, or operating in adverse weather conditions, the verification process can focus on the most critical and relevant aspects of the system's behavior. Each scenario is designed to capture the essential interactions between the autonomous system and its environment, allowing for a more targeted and efficient analysis.

The core of scenario-based verification lies in the probabilistic abstraction of the learning-enabled components within each scenario. This abstraction enables the verification process to scale to systems with sophisticated sensor and perception modules, which are often the most challenging to verify due to their reliance on machine learning algorithms. By modeling these components probabilistically, the verification framework can account for the uncertainties and variabilities inherent in real-world data. This probabilistic approach not only enhances the robustness of the verification process but also allows for the computation of safety guarantees over extended time horizons, which is crucial for ensuring the long-term reliability of autonomous systems.

Moreover, scenario-based verification facilitates the integration of diverse data sources and simulation tools, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of the system's performance under various conditions. For instance, in the context of autonomous driving, different scenarios can be defined to test the system's ability to handle traffic congestion, pedestrian interactions, and emergency maneuvers. The results from these scenarios can then be aggregated to provide a holistic assessment of the system's safety and reliability. This method not only streamlines the verification process but also ensures that the system is thoroughly tested across a wide range of operational conditions, thereby increasing the confidence in its deployment in real-world settings.

### 4.3.3 Semiparametric Bayesian DTR Estimation
Semiparametric Bayesian Dynamic Treatment Regime (DTR) estimation is a sophisticated approach that combines the flexibility of nonparametric methods with the interpretability of parametric models [18]. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where the treatment effects are influenced by latent individual-level covariates that are not directly observed but are conditionally independent of the treatment assignments. By integrating these latent variables into the model, semiparametric Bayesian DTR estimation can provide more accurate and personalized treatment recommendations [18]. The core of this approach lies in the use of dynamic marginal structural models (MSMs), which allow for the estimation of the causal effects of time-varying treatments while accounting for time-dependent confounders.

The semiparametric Bayesian framework typically employs a combination of Bayesian nonparametric techniques, such as Gaussian processes, to model the complex relationships between covariates and outcomes, and parametric components to specify the treatment effects. This hybrid approach enables the model to adapt to the underlying data structure while maintaining a clear interpretation of the treatment effects. The use of Bayesian inference through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge and the quantification of uncertainty in the estimated DTRs. This is particularly important in real-time or continuous-time settings where decisions need to be made under uncertainty and with limited data.

Recent advancements in semiparametric Bayesian DTR estimation have focused on addressing the challenges of high-dimensional data and complex treatment structures. For instance, methods that incorporate sparsity-inducing priors have been developed to handle high-dimensional covariates, making the models more computationally feasible and interpretable. Additionally, the integration of machine learning techniques, such as deep neural networks, has been explored to enhance the flexibility and predictive power of the models. These developments have broadened the applicability of semiparametric Bayesian DTR estimation to a wide range of fields, including personalized medicine, behavioral interventions, and policy evaluation [18].

## 5.1 Multi-Modal Data Integration

### 5.1.1 Surgical Report Generation from Video Data
Surgical report generation from video data is a multifaceted task that integrates computer vision and natural language processing to produce structured and detailed reports [19]. The primary goal is to automate the extraction of relevant surgical information from video recordings, thereby reducing the burden on healthcare professionals and improving the accuracy and consistency of surgical documentation. This section delves into the methodologies and challenges associated with generating surgical reports from video data, focusing on recent advancements and their implications for clinical practice.

The process begins with the extraction of visual features from individual video frames. Transformer-based models, such as Vision Transformers (ViTs), are employed to detect surgical instruments, anatomical structures, and specific surgical actions. These models leverage deep learning architectures to identify and classify various elements within the surgical field with high precision. The detected features are then mapped to frame-level captions, which provide a textual description of the visual content. This step is crucial for ensuring that the subsequent stages can effectively interpret and synthesize the information.

Following the feature extraction and captioning, the visual content and frame-level captions are integrated using a Video Transformer (ViViT) encoder. The ViViT model captures the temporal dynamics of the surgical procedure by modeling the relationships between consecutive frames and their corresponding captions [19]. This temporal modeling enables the generation of clip-level summaries that accurately reflect the sequence of events during the surgery. Finally, a specialized Language Model (LLM) is used to compose a coherent and informative surgical report by aggregating the clip descriptions [19]. The LLM ensures that the report is well-structured and adheres to the standard format expected in clinical settings, making it a valuable tool for post-operative care and documentation.

### 5.1.2 Gravitationally Microlensed GRB Detection
Gravitationally microlensed Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) represent a unique opportunity to probe the properties of both the lens and the source [20]. Microlensing occurs when a compact object, such as a star or a black hole, passes in front of a distant GRB, causing the light from the GRB to be bent and magnified. Unlike strong lensing, where the time delay between multiple images can be significantly longer than the burst duration, microlensing results in time delays that are typically on the order of milliseconds to seconds, which are much shorter than the typical duration of a GRB [20]. This phenomenon can lead to characteristic distortions in the light curve, making it a valuable tool for studying the intrinsic properties of GRBs and the intervening lensing objects.

To detect microlensed GRBs, advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques are essential. The primary challenge lies in distinguishing the subtle effects of microlensing from other sources of variability, such as intrinsic variability of the GRB itself, instrumental noise, and other astrophysical phenomena. Machine learning algorithms, particularly those based on deep neural networks, have shown promise in this area. These models can be trained on simulated light curves that include a range of microlensing scenarios, allowing them to learn the distinctive features of microlensed events. Feature extraction techniques, such as time-frequency analysis and wavelet transforms, are often employed to enhance the detectability of microlensing signals in noisy data.

The detection of gravitationally microlensed GRBs has significant implications for both astrophysics and cosmology [20]. By analyzing the magnification patterns and time delays, researchers can infer the mass and distribution of compact objects in the lensing galaxy, providing insights into the nature of dark matter and the structure of the universe. Additionally, the study of microlensed GRBs can help constrain the properties of the GRB progenitors and their environments, contributing to our understanding of high-energy astrophysical processes. The development of robust detection algorithms and the accumulation of observational data are crucial steps towards realizing the full potential of microlensed GRBs as probes of the cosmos.

### 5.1.3 Multimodal Segmentation for Lymphoma Diagnosis
Multimodal segmentation for lymphoma diagnosis integrates multiple imaging modalities, such as PET and CT, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of diagnostic models [21]. This approach leverages the complementary strengths of each modality to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the disease. PET imaging, for instance, is highly sensitive to metabolic activity, making it effective in identifying active lymphoma lesions, while CT provides detailed anatomical information, crucial for precise lesion localization and characterization. By combining these modalities, multimodal segmentation algorithms can better capture the heterogeneity of lymphoma, which is essential for accurate staging and personalized treatment planning [21].

The construction of a high-quality multimodal segmentation dataset is a critical step in advancing lymphoma diagnosis [21]. Such datasets must be carefully curated to include a diverse range of cases, reflecting the varied presentations of lymphoma. Retrospective collection of PET and CT data, followed by rigorous annotation by domain experts, ensures that the dataset is both comprehensive and clinically relevant. The dataset should also be split into training, validation, and testing sets to facilitate the development and evaluation of segmentation models. This structured approach helps in addressing the challenges posed by the large heterogeneity of lymphoma, such as variations in lesion morphology, location, and metabolic features, which can significantly affect the performance of segmentation algorithms.

To overcome the limitations of single-modality imaging and improve diagnostic accuracy, deep learning (DL) models have been increasingly applied to multimodal segmentation tasks. These models can effectively learn complex features from combined PET and CT data, enabling more accurate and robust segmentation of lymphoma lesions. Techniques such as multi-view ensembling, where predictions from different imaging views (sagittal, axial, and coronal) are combined, have shown promise in enhancing overall accuracy [22]. Additionally, external validation on independent datasets is crucial to ensure the generalizability and clinical applicability of these models. The development and release of high-quality multimodal datasets, along with the application of advanced DL methodologies, are key to advancing the field of lymphoma diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.

## 5.2 High-Resolution Image and Video Analysis

### 5.2.1 Steel Surface Quality Control with Deep Learning
Steel surface quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing processes, particularly in industries such as automotive and construction, where the integrity of steel components directly impacts product reliability and safety. Traditional methods of quality control rely heavily on manual inspection, which is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error. The advent of deep learning (DL) has revolutionized this process by providing automated, accurate, and consistent methods for detecting surface defects. DL models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown remarkable capabilities in identifying various types of defects, including scratches, rust, and pitting, even in complex and varying surface conditions.

To address the challenges of steel surface quality control, researchers have developed specialized datasets and DL models tailored to this domain. One such dataset, SteelBlastQC, consists of 1654 high-resolution RGB images of shot-blasted steel surfaces, each labeled by domain experts [23]. This dataset captures a wide range of surface defects and variations in shot-blasted finishes, making it a valuable resource for training and evaluating DL models [23]. The images in SteelBlastQC are annotated with binary labels indicating whether the surface is "ready for paint" or "needs shotblasting," reflecting practical quality control standards [23]. By benchmarking both supervised and unsupervised DL algorithms on this dataset, researchers can systematically evaluate the performance of different models and identify the most effective approaches for automated defect detection.

The application of DL in steel surface quality control involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, model training, and post-processing. Data preprocessing is crucial for enhancing the quality and consistency of input images, which may vary due to factors such as lighting conditions, camera angles, and surface reflectivity. Techniques such as normalization, augmentation, and noise reduction are commonly employed to prepare the data for model training. During training, DL models learn to recognize patterns and features associated with different types of defects. Post-processing steps, such as thresholding and morphological operations, are then applied to refine the detection results and reduce false positives. Overall, the integration of DL into steel surface quality control offers a promising solution for improving the efficiency and reliability of manufacturing processes.

### 5.2.2 Stereo X-Ray Vision for Feature Mapping
Stereo X-ray vision leverages multiple X-ray sources and detectors to create a 3D reconstruction of an object, providing a robust method for feature mapping in complex and opaque materials [24]. Unlike traditional stereo vision, which aligns points between two images, X-ray stereo vision must account for the attenuation of X-rays through the object, complicating the matching process [24]. This approach involves capturing multiple 2D projections from different angles, which are then used to infer the 3D structure of the object. The key challenge lies in accurately identifying and aligning corresponding points in these projections, as the X-ray intensity measured at a specific location on the detector contains information from an entire line through the object, rather than a single 3D point.

To address these challenges, advanced computational methods are employed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of feature mapping. Techniques such as deep learning and computer stereo vision algorithms are utilized to process the X-ray data and reconstruct the 3D geometry of the object. These methods can rapidly map the spatial distribution of features, such as edges and corners, at the speed of the detector frame rate. This is particularly advantageous in applications requiring real-time or near-real-time analysis, such as industrial inspection and medical imaging, where the ability to quickly and accurately identify internal structures is crucial.

Furthermore, the integration of multiple X-ray sources and detectors in a stereo configuration allows for the acquisition of dense and detailed 3D data, which can be used to generate high-resolution maps of the object's internal features [24]. This approach not only improves the spatial resolution but also enhances the robustness of the feature mapping process by providing multiple perspectives and reducing the impact of occlusions and noise. The resulting 3D models can be used for a variety of applications, including non-destructive testing, quality control, and the analysis of complex materials and structures.

### 5.2.3 In-Flight Novelty Detection with CNNs
In-Flight Novelty Detection with CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) is a critical component in ensuring the robustness and reliability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable environments. Traditional novelty detection methods often rely on hand-crafted features and statistical models, which may not generalize well to the diverse and complex scenarios encountered by UAVs. CNNs, with their ability to learn hierarchical feature representations directly from raw sensor data, offer a more adaptive and scalable solution. By leveraging the spatial and temporal information captured by onboard cameras, CNNs can effectively identify novel objects or situations that deviate from the training data, enabling real-time decision-making and risk mitigation.

The architecture of CNNs for in-flight novelty detection typically involves a combination of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers extract local features from the input images, while pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions and introduce translation invariance. Fully connected layers then integrate these features to make high-level decisions about the novelty of the observed scene. Recent advancements have also explored the integration of recurrent neural network (RNN) components, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, to capture temporal dependencies and enhance the model's ability to detect anomalies over time. This hybrid approach, combining spatial and temporal analysis, is particularly useful in scenarios where the environment changes rapidly or where the UAV must perform continuous monitoring.

To train CNNs for in-flight novelty detection, it is essential to use a diverse and representative dataset that captures a wide range of normal and abnormal conditions. The CODrone dataset, with its extensive collection of UAV-captured images and oriented bounding box annotations, provides a valuable resource for this purpose [25]. By training on a dataset that includes various object categories, viewing angles, and environmental conditions, the CNN can develop a robust understanding of what constitutes normal behavior and more accurately identify novel or potentially hazardous situations. Additionally, techniques such as data augmentation and transfer learning can further enhance the model's generalization capabilities, making it more effective in real-world applications.

## 5.3 Photometric and 3D Reconstruction

### 5.3.1 UPMASK for Stellar Cluster Membership
UPMASK (Unsupervised Photometric Membership Assignment in Stellar Clusters) represents a significant advancement in the field of stellar cluster membership determination, particularly in scenarios where traditional methods based on kinematic data are limited [26]. Unlike conventional approaches that rely heavily on proper motions and radial velocities, UPMASK operates solely on multi-band photometry and projected on-sky positions, making it applicable to a broader range of observational data. The algorithm employs a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and a clustering technique, specifically a mixture of Gaussian distributions, to identify and separate cluster members from field stars [26]. This datadriven approach minimizes the reliance on theoretical models and assumptions, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalizability of the membership assignment process.

The core of UPMASK lies in its ability to handle the inherent complexity and contamination present in observational data. By transforming the photometric and positional data into a lower-dimensional space using PCA, the algorithm effectively reduces noise and captures the essential features that distinguish cluster members from non-members. Subsequently, the mixture of Gaussian distributions is used to model the distribution of stars in this reduced space, allowing for the probabilistic assignment of membership. This probabilistic framework is crucial, as it accounts for the uncertainties and variations in the data, providing a more nuanced and reliable classification. UPMASK's flexibility is further demonstrated by its applicability to various types of data, including those with incomplete or missing measurements, which is a common issue in astronomical observations.

One of the key advantages of UPMASK is its adaptability to different observational contexts and datasets. The algorithm can be readily applied to both ground-based and space-based observations, making it a versatile tool for astronomers working with diverse datasets. Additionally, UPMASK's performance has been validated through extensive testing on simulated and real-world data, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately identifying cluster members even in crowded and contaminated fields. This capability is particularly valuable for studying distant and less well-characterized clusters, where traditional methods may be insufficient. Overall, UPMASK represents a powerful and flexible solution for addressing the challenges of stellar cluster membership determination in modern astronomy.

### 5.3.2 Large Inverse Rendering Model for 3D Reconstruction
Large Inverse Rendering Models (LIRMs) represent a significant advancement in 3D reconstruction, particularly in scenarios where multiple images are captured under varying lighting conditions and from different viewpoints [27]. These models leverage deep learning architectures to simultaneously estimate the geometry, material properties, and lighting conditions of a scene from a set of input images. Unlike traditional methods that often require carefully controlled environments and extensive manual tuning, LIRMs can handle real-world complexities, including dynamic lighting and non-uniform surfaces, making them highly versatile for applications ranging from urban mapping to industrial inspection.

The core capability of LIRMs lies in their ability to disentangle the intrinsic properties of objects from the extrinsic factors affecting the observed images. This is achieved through a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for synthesizing high-fidelity 3D models. The CNNs are trained to recognize and extract meaningful features from the input images, while the GANs ensure that the reconstructed 3D models are not only geometrically accurate but also visually plausible. This dual approach enables LIRMs to produce detailed and realistic 3D reconstructions even from noisy or incomplete data, thereby enhancing their robustness and applicability in diverse environments.

Moreover, recent developments in LIRMs have focused on improving computational efficiency and scalability, addressing the limitations of earlier methods that were computationally intensive and required significant processing time. Advanced optimization techniques and parallel computing strategies have been integrated into the training and inference processes, allowing these models to handle large datasets and real-time applications. Additionally, the integration of multi-view data from various sources, such as aerial and ground-level imagery, further enhances the accuracy and completeness of the 3D reconstructions, making LIRMs a powerful tool for creating detailed and comprehensive 3D models of complex scenes.

### 5.3.3 Photometric Redshift Estimation for DESI
Photometric redshift estimation (photo-𝑧) is a crucial component of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) project, which aims to map the universe's large-scale structure to understand the nature of dark energy [28]. The DESI survey utilizes a combination of broad-band photometry and machine learning algorithms to estimate redshifts for millions of galaxies. The primary goal is to achieve accurate and precise photo-𝑧s for a wide range of galaxy types, including luminous red galaxies (LRGs), emission-line galaxies (ELGs), and quasars (QSOs).

The methodology employed for photo-𝑧 estimation in DESI involves several key steps. First, the photometric data are processed and calibrated to ensure consistency across different bands and instruments. This includes correcting for atmospheric effects, instrumental responses, and other systematic biases. The next step involves the application of machine learning algorithms, such as random forests, neural networks, and Gaussian processes, to model the relationship between the observed photometry and the true redshift. These models are trained on a spectroscopic sample of galaxies with known redshifts, which serves as a ground truth for validating the photo-𝑧 estimates [28].

To enhance the accuracy and reliability of the photo-𝑧s, DESI employs a variety of techniques, including the use of multi-band photometry, morphological information, and ancillary data from other surveys. For instance, the inclusion of near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) data helps to better constrain the redshifts of dusty and high-redshift galaxies. Additionally, the application of quality cuts, such as magnitude and color thresholds, ensures that the photo-𝑧 estimates are robust and minimizes the impact of outliers and contaminants. The final photo-𝑧 catalog is rigorously tested against independent spectroscopic samples to assess its performance and identify potential systematic biases.
