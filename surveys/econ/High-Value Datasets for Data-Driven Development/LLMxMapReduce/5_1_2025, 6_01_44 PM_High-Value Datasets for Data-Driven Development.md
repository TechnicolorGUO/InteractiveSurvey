0. High-Value Datasets for Data-Driven Development  

# 1. Introduction  

The escalating volume, velocity, and variety of data generated across diverse sectors have positioned data as a fundamental asset in the contemporary digital landscape. Within this paradigm, "high-value datasets" represent data collections characterized by attributes such as quality, relevance, accessibility, and scale, which confer significant potential to drive progress and generate substantial impact [4,7,9]. Relatedly, "open data" refers specifically to data that can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose, serving as a key component within the broader ecosystem of high-value datasets [25]. Initiatives promoting open data, such as the Open Government Data License, aim to facilitate data sharing, enhance data quality, and optimize public services by combining government resources with private sector creativity [17]. The increasing recognition of data's strategic value underscores its transformative potential across various industries and societal domains [4,7,20,33].​  

High-value datasets are instrumental in driving innovation and fostering economic growth. They enable the development of new products and services, facilitate improved decision-making, and create new revenue streams through data monetization [4,20,28]. Data monetization, which involves generating economic benefit from data, is becoming central to modern digital business models, allowing organizations to optimize costs, enhance customer experience, and secure a competitive advantage [20,28]. Beyond the business realm, these datasets are crucial for addressing pressing societal challenges. They are vital for evidence-informed policymaking [5,32], promoting government transparency and citizen engagement [25], and supporting sustainable development initiatives like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [10,12,38]. Furthermore, data-driven approaches are essential for tackling complex global issues such as understanding and mitigating the impacts of climate change at local levels [16]. The application of data extends to improving essential services and infrastructure, aiding planning and decision-making processes for local governments [3]. The growing significance is reflected in the increasing demand for timely and comparable statistics to inform digital economy policy [32].​  

Advancements in fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence heavily rely on the availability and quality of datasets [9,18]. High-quality, well-curated datasets are fundamental for successful machine learning, significantly impacting model development, performance, accuracy, fairness, robustness, and generalizability [9,18,22,23]. The power of machine learning models is intrinsically linked to the data they are trained on, requiring not just large quantities but also accuracy and curation [9,18]. This increasing reliance highlights the critical need for readily available and suitable datasets for research and application development across various sectors [6,11]. Similarly, leveraging big data is increasingly vital for sustainable development and humanitarian action, providing real-time insights into well-being and enabling targeted interventions [12].​  

While the opportunities presented by high-value datasets are substantial, their effective utilization is accompanied by significant challenges. A primary challenge lies in ensuring data quality, which is often overlooked but critical for the performance and reliability of data-driven systems, particularly in machine learning contexts [18,22,23]. Accessibility to relevant data remains a challenge, despite efforts like open data initiatives, as the expected widespread use and societal value have not always been fully realized [3]. Furthermore, concerns around data privacy, security, data misuse, inequality, and bias pose critical ethical and practical hurdles that necessitate careful consideration and responsible data practices [10,12]. Other challenges include developing necessary infrastructure, navigating market competition, and addressing complex ethical dilemmas associated with data utilization [10]. Concurrently, opportunities abound, including the potential for data collaboratives that facilitate the exchange of private data for public good, benefiting both society and participating entities. Microsoft's efforts to advance open data for societal benefit by making data sharing easier through tools, frameworks, and partnerships exemplify initiatives aimed at realizing these opportunities [13,27]. Harnessing the potential of enterprise data through a well-defined data strategy is essential for unlocking benefits like smarter decision-making and new revenue streams [7].​

This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of high-value datasets in the context of data-driven development. Building upon this introduction, which has defined key concepts and highlighted their significance, challenges, and opportunities, subsequent sections will delve deeper into specific aspects. We will explore the different types and sources of high-value datasets, analyze their applications across various domains, detail the methodologies for data curation and quality assessment, discuss technical and ethical challenges in their management and use, and identify future research directions in this rapidly evolving field [10,11,12].​  

# 2. Defining High-Value Datasets  

Defining "high-value datasets" is fundamental to understanding their role in data-driven development. This section synthesizes insights from existing literature to provide a clear and comprehensive definition, focusing on the inherent characteristics that confer value and the diverse dimensions across which this value is realized [10,25]. A framework for evaluating dataset value is developed by analyzing key attributes such as data quality, relevance, accessibility, and usability, building upon established data quality dimensions [9,22]. We will examine the relationship between "open data" and "highvalue data," arguing that adherence to open data principles significantly enhances data value and impact [25]. The perspectives of international organizations like the OECD and the UN on defining and promoting high-value datasets, considering their relevance to policy, availability, and quality, are also integrated [5,34]. Furthermore, the discussion delves into the multifaceted dimensions of value associated with high-value datasets, encompassing economic, societal, and environmental benefits, which are critical enablers for achieving sustainable development goals and fostering economic prosperity [9,27,34,35].

High-value datasets are distinguished by attributes that facilitate their effective use in data-driven development and decision-making. Synthesizing the principles of "open data" and key dimensions of "data quality" provides a comprehensive framework for understanding these characteristics [22,25]. Open data principles stipulate that data should be complete, basic, timely, available, machine-readable, and nondiscriminatory, accompanied by an open license without usage priorities [25]. Such data must be legally and technically accessible for use and republication by the scientific community, industry, and the public, ideally in open machine-readable formats [17,25]. Concurrently, data quality dimensions encompass accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, and provenance, alongside considerations of biases and representativeness [9,22,27,34]. Additional characteristics highlighted include accessibility, usability, relevance, understandability, cleanliness, granularity, standardization, and metadata richness [3,6,11,24,27,34]. Cleanliness, specifically, involves the absence of issues such as bias, inaccuracy, unreliability, false representation, errors, ambiguity, corrupted data, or duplicates [6,9,18].  

The relative importance of these data characteristics varies significantly across different application scenarios. For instance, timeliness is paramount for real-time decision-making processes, where insights derived from current or recently collected data are essential for effective action [5,16]. Conversely, for scientific research or evidence-based policy formulation, accuracy is a critical attribute, demanding trusted statistics and reliable information to support rigorous analysis and conclusions [5]. In the context of machine learning, data quality, encompassing accuracy, cleanliness, consistency, and representativeness, directly impacts model performance; poor quality data, such as corrupted images or inadequate annotations, can lead to incorrect predictions and limit the effectiveness of transfer tasks [9,18]. The assessment of data quality, including factors like class imbalance, fairness, and outlier detection, is crucial, although it is not always routinely performed before model construction [23].  

Relevance is another fundamental characteristic, but its definition is intrinsically tied to the specific application domain and the problem being addressed [27,34]. For example, training a machine learning model to identify bicycles necessitates datasets containing images of bicycles, ideally representing various types and contexts, to ensure the data aligns with the model's objective [9]. In infrastructure planning, relevance is determined by the data's ability to effectively inform investment decisions, requiring granular, standardized, and potentially multimodal data that includes specific types of infrastructure information [3]. For policy needs, relevance means aligning data with specific governmental or organizational objectives [5]. Ultimately, relevance is measured by the data's utility and impact in solving the defined problem or enabling intended applications [3,24].​  

Furthermore, data documentation and metadata play a crucial role in determining the usability and credibility of datasets [25,27,34]. Metadata provides essential context, evaluating data reliability and quality, thereby promoting increased data use and facilitating credibility determination [25]. Comprehensive documentation, including descriptions and examples, supports users in understanding the data's structure, content, and potential applications, enhancing accessibility and reducing the effort required for data preparation and analysis [11]. The presence of structured formats and accessibility via APIs also contributes significantly to data usability [24]. Collaborative efforts to build high-quality datasets, supported by appropriate documentation and metadata, are advocated to nourish AI development and ensure the free flow of data in accordance with legal frameworks [36].  

# 2.2 Dimensions of Value  

![](images/6ea903d3589cc8745068198ebecbd2073859e8748f78c2c96023334797303f0c.jpg)  

High-value datasets (HVDs) are capable of generating multifaceted value, often simultaneously across economic, societal, and environmental dimensions, thereby underpinning data-driven development [9,27,34,35]. Beyond these primary areas, HVDs also yield significant value in advancing AI development [6,8,11].​  

Economically, HVDs foster increased efficiency, enable the development of new products and services, confer competitive advantages, and create new revenue streams [4,9,20,27,34,35]. Examples include finance and economics datasets like those from Quandl and World Bank Open Data, which facilitate the construction of predictive models for economic indicators or stock prices [6]. OECD data provides economic value through indicators on R&D tax incentives [5], while infrastructure development datasets contribute to economic growth [3]. Data monetization strategies further exemplify the direct economic value, allowing organizations to generate income by selling datasets [4].​  

Societal value is realized through improved public services, advancements in scientific discovery, and the capacity to address critical development challenges [9,27,34,35]. This includes improving good governance, promoting gender equality and inclusion [38], and enhancing access to essential services like jobs, housing, schools, and healthcare [3]. Public government datasets such as Data.gov and the UK Data Service enable analyses for assessing school performance, understanding food environments, and examining chronic disease indicators, thereby improving public service delivery [6]. In healthcare, datasets can lead to improved outcomes for patients through enhanced screening, diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication [23]. Furthermore, big data applications addressing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as using mobile phone data to estimate income (SDG 1), track food prices for food security monitoring (SDG 2), or map population movement for infectious disease prediction (SDG 3), distinctly highlight the societal impact of HVDs [12]. Societal value is also derived from supporting research and innovation across diverse fields [11].​  

Environmental value is generated through applications supporting sustainable resource management and climate change mitigation [5,27,34,35]. OECD data, for instance, includes indicators like patents on environmental technologies and land cover change [5]. Datasets related to infrastructure can also contribute to environmental resilience by informing strategies to reduce congestion and improve community preparedness for extreme weather events [3].  

Crucially, open government data serves as a prime example of HVDs that simultaneously create value across multiple dimensions. Openness in government data promotes transparency and accountability, fosters citizen engagement, and facilitates the creation of new services that offer both social and commercial benefits [25]. This process energizes civic participation, helps combat corruption, and improves the overall quality and value of government services [17,25]. Simultaneously, open government data fuels innovation and generates economic benefits by providing accessible resource for research, new insights, discoveries, and the development of data-driven applications [25].  

The value dimensions often interact and reinforce each other. Data collaboratives, for instance, enhance situational and causal analysis, improve predictive capabilities for decision-makers, and make AI models more robust [8], contributing to both societal (e.g., better public services based on improved analysis) and economic (e.g., increased efficiency) outcomes. Initiatives like open food data hackathons demonstrate this synergy, spurring business innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities (economic value) alongside projects aimed at public health goals like encouraging balanced diets and improving food traceability (societal value) [24]. The OECD's comprehensive data collection provides examples spanning R&D tax incentives (economic), gender wage gaps (societal), and environmental patents (environmental) within a single source [5].​  

The capacity of HVDs to generate value across these interconnected dimensions is fundamental to achieving sustainable development goals and fostering economic prosperity. By providing the empirical basis for informed decision-making, innovation, and efficient resource allocation, HVDs serve as critical enablers for progress across a wide spectrum of societal challenges and economic opportunities.  

# 3. The Data Lifecycle for High-Value Datasets  

Effective data-driven development relies fundamentally on the systematic management of high-value datasets (HVDs) throughout their existence. This encompasses a comprehensive data lifecycle, spanning from the initial stages of collection and acquisition to the long-term preservation of these valuable resources. Understanding and meticulously managing each phase of this lifecycle is paramount to unlocking the full potential of data for informed decision-making, innovation, and scientific advancement.  

![](images/77c60a8d9df0c3e21f13a33abcf89b6d9fdde604f3de8d4acf420d4242d96ecd.jpg)  

This section provides an overarching framework for analyzing the key steps involved, which are elaborated upon in the subsequent sub-sections.  

The data lifecycle for HVDs commences with Data Collection and Acquisition. This phase involves identifying and gathering relevant data from a multitude of sources, which can range from traditional databases and surveys to modern methods leveraging sensors, social media, and satellite imagery. A critical aspect at this stage is navigating the inherent trade-offs between the cost, coverage, and quality of the data obtained, as different collection methods and sources present distinct characteristics and challenges [18,28]. Subsequent processes like initial formatting and cleansing are also integral to preparing the collected data for further use.  

Following collection, the data undergoes Creation, Curation, and Annotation. This involves transforming raw or disparate data into a structured, consistent, and usable format. Curation techniques encompass formatting, cleansing, extraction, validation, and documentation, all aimed at improving data consistency, completeness, and relevance. For specific applications, particularly in supervised machine learning, data annotation becomes crucial, requiring experts to label data instances accurately, which directly impacts model performance.  

Maintaining the integrity and utility of HVDs necessitates continuous Data Quality Assessment and Improvement. This phase focuses on identifying and addressing issues related to dimensions such as completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, validity, and fairness. Various methods and tools are employed to quantify data quality and implement cleaning and preprocessing techniques to rectify identified deficiencies, ensuring the data is fit for purpose.​  

Throughout the lifecycle, robust Data Governance and Management Frameworks are indispensable. These frameworks establish the policies, procedures, roles, and standards necessary to ensure data quality, security, privacy, and usability [7,35]. Effective governance balances the imperative for data utilization and innovation with the need to mitigate risks associated with data sharing and access, upholding responsible data stewardship [7].​  

Finally, ensuring the enduring value and accessibility of HVDs requires dedicated Data Preservation strategies. This involves systematically archiving, versioning, and tracking the provenance of datasets to support future research, historical analysis, and the reproducibility of findings. Robust preservation practices safeguard against data loss and technological obsolescence, extending the lifespan and impact of high-value data assets [35].  

Collectively, these interconnected stages form a comprehensive lifecycle approach essential for transforming raw data into valuable assets that effectively underpin data-driven development efforts.  

# 3.1 Data Collection and Acquisition  

Effective data-driven development hinges upon the systematic collection and acquisition of pertinent data. The methodologies for obtaining data are diverse, drawing from a wide array of sources including internal and external databases, government agencies, private companies, research institutions, and citizen science initiatives [9,27,34]. Contemporary approaches leverage technologies such as crowdsourcing, tracking of online information, mobile phone data, various sensor types (water pumps, smart metering, environmental sensors), global postal traffic analysis, GPS data, satellite remote sensing, social media monitoring, and maritime vessel tracking [12,16]. Some efforts also involve the creation of entirely new datasets to supplement existing information [24].  

The choice of data collection method and source involves navigating trade-offs between cost, coverage, and data quality [18]. Diverse sources offer varied characteristics. Government datasets, often released by entities performing public duties, can provide broad coverage and official statistics [17,34]. However, challenges exist regarding their timeliness, granularity, and the mechanisms for collation and sharing, as seen in efforts to standardize biodiversity and environmental data [30]. Private sector data, such as call detail records from telecom providers or data from commercial satellite operators and corporations, can offer highly granular and potentially real-time insights, though access may be restricted or costly [8]. Sensor data, collected from extensive networks like the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) or Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), provides continuous, objective measurements across environmental variables, offering high coverage in monitored areas but incurring significant infrastructure and maintenance costs [16]. Custom datasets, such as those compiled from diverse health records and medical imaging, can yield high quality and specificity for particular research questions but are often limited in coverage and require substantial effort to curate [23]. Public data repositories like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, Google Dataset Search, and various governmental and institutional platforms offer readily accessible datasets covering numerous domains, representing a cost-effective option for broad coverage, though the quality and relevance for a specific task can vary [6,11]. Acquiring data often requires strategies centered on addressing the specific needs of decision-makers and striving for assorted and meaningful information [18]. The crucial initial step in the data lifecycle is the fundamental act of collecting and logging data [20].  

Once data is collected, preprocessing techniques such as formatting and cleansing are essential steps to ensure usability [9,27,34]. While the digests highlight the necessity of these processes, they do not detail the specific impact of different techniques on the statistical properties of the resulting datasets.  

Integrating data from multiple, disparate sources presents significant challenges. Differences in format, standards, granularity, collection methodologies, and inherent biases across sources necessitate robust data formatting and cleansing processes to achieve coherence [9,27,34]. The lack of standardized mechanisms for collation and sharing, particularly evident in domains like biodiversity and environmental data, further complicates the integration process, limiting the ability to synthesize information for comprehensive understanding and action [30]. The ambition to leverage assorted data [18] inherently requires overcoming these integration hurdles to combine information effectively.  

# 3.2 Creation, Curation, and Annotation  

The construction of high-value datasets for data-driven development is fundamentally reliant upon robust processes encompassing creation, curation, and annotation. Data curation involves a series of techniques aimed at transforming raw or disparate data into a form suitable for analysis and modeling, thereby addressing various data quality challenges. Key steps identified in this process include formatting, cleansing, extraction, validation, and documentation [5,18].  

Formatting ensures data consistency by unifying different data sources, currencies, or semantic representations into a common structure [18]. Cleansing techniques are employed to handle data quality issues such as removing suboptimal characters and managing missing values, often involving weighted approaches based on the perceived need for completeness [18]. Extraction focuses on identifying and optimizing features crucial for predictive capability, which also contributes to efficiency in computation and memory usage [18].  

Broader curation activities mentioned include validation and documentation [5], error correction, and ensuring data consistency [22]. Furthermore, establishing data collation and sharing standards based on agreed-upon international protocols is vital for domain-specific datasets, such as those in biodiversity monitoring, to ensure comparability and reliability [30]. While the digests outline these techniques, detailed comparisons of their specific effectiveness across diverse datasets and quality challenges are not extensively provided. However, it is evident that different techniques target distinct aspects of data quality, from structural consistency to feature relevance and error reduction.​  

Data annotation is a critical component, particularly for supervised machine learning, where it involves experts identifying targets and applying descriptive labels to data instances, such as annotating images or videos to highlight important features [9]. The quality of this annotation significantly impacts the performance of machine learning models [9]. Accurate and well-chosen labels are crucial as they guide the model's learning process, ensuring it focuses on the correct features necessary for effective task performance [9]. For example, accurate labeling of different bird types in images enables a model to learn discriminatory features [9]. Assessing data quality metrics like label purity further underscores the importance of annotation accuracy for model reliability [23].​  

Despite its importance, the annotation process is subject to challenges, notably annotator bias and inter-annotator disagreement [9]. These issues can introduce inconsistencies and errors into the dataset, potentially degrading model performance. While the digests highlight these challenges, specific strategies for mitigating annotator bias and systematically improving annotation accuracy are not detailed within the provided content [9].  

To address the resource-intensive nature and potential cost of data annotation, various techniques are employed. Humanin-the-loop (HILT) processes are considered essential, involving continuous collaboration between humans and machines to refine datasets and improve model performance [9]. Within this framework, techniques such as active learning pipelines and AI-assisted tools are utilized in the data labeling process [9]. Active learning, for instance, can potentially reduce the volume of data requiring manual annotation by intelligently selecting the most informative samples to be labeled, thereby contributing to cost efficiency, although this specific benefit is inferred rather than explicitly stated in the digests [9]. AIassisted tools can further streamline the process by providing preliminary labels or suggestions that human annotators can verify and correct [9].​  

In summary, the creation of high-value datasets necessitates diligent curation using techniques like formatting, cleansing, extraction, and standardization to address quality issues. High-quality annotation, particularly accurate labeling, is paramount for effective machine learning model training by directing feature focus. While challenges like annotator bias persist, methodologies including HILT, active learning, and AI assistance are integrated into the annotation workflow to enhance efficiency and manage costs.​  

# 3.3 Data Quality Assessment and Improvement  

The efficacy and reliability of data-driven development and artificial intelligence (AI) models are fundamentally contingent upon the quality of the underlying data [8]. Poor data quality can necessitate significant time investment for cleaning [6], underscoring the strategic advantage of prioritizing datasets that exhibit high inherent cleanliness [6]. Addressing data quality issues is paramount; indeed, existing data can be as powerful as "big" data if its quality concerns are properly managed [16].​  

Developing a robust framework for assessing data quality in high-value datasets requires considering the specific demands of diverse data-driven applications [22]. Key data quality dimensions commonly recognized in literature include completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, validity, and biases [22,27]. Other important aspects encompass fairness, representativeness, granularity, and standardization [3,23]. Various methods and tools are employed to assess and quantify these dimensions across different dataset types [22,27]. A survey identified seventeen distinct tools for data quality evaluation and improvement, highlighting the diverse landscape of available resources [22]. Model performance on unseen "test data" also serves as an indirect indicator of data quality, revealing deficiencies that may necessitate further data refinement or model retraining [9]. Rigorous assessment methodologies, such as the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment (PROBAST) tool, are employed in studies evaluating the quality of data used in model development, particularly concerning parameters like class imbalance, data fairness, outlier detection, and representativeness [23,27]. The emphasis on "trusted statistics" by organizations like the OECD also implicitly highlights the critical role of rigorous data quality processes [5].​  

Effective data cleaning and preprocessing techniques are crucial for improving data quality [23,27]. Strategies for addressing common data quality issues involve handling missing values, managing outliers, resolving inconsistencies, and mitigating biases [18,23]. Cleansing datasets involves removing suboptimal characters and strategically managing missing values based on the specific needs of the application [18]. Preprocessing pipelines often include validation and error handling procedures to ensure data integrity [27]. Addressing issues like class imbalance is particularly vital as it can significantly reduce model performance, especially in structured datasets [23,27]. Data assimilation techniques, for instance, are used in fields like climate science to incorporate new observational data into models for ongoing correction, adjustment, and validation, effectively improving data quality over time [16].​  

Assessing and improving data quality presents distinct challenges depending on whether datasets are structured or unstructured [22,23]. For structured datasets, issues such as class imbalance have been shown to impair discriminatory performance in machine learning models [23]. In contrast, for unstructured data like images, factors such as higher resolution and good class overlap tend to improve model performance, highlighting the different quality metrics and challenges inherent in disparate data types [23]. Standardizing data is also mentioned as a crucial aspect for enhancing quality, particularly relevant across heterogeneous data sources [3].  

Emerging technologies, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI, show potential for significant applications in data quality evaluation and improvement [22,27]. These tools could potentially automate or enhance tasks such as data cleaning, validation, augmentation, and the generation of synthetic data [22,27].  

Maintaining data quality is a continuous process. Data Providing Organizations bear responsibility for correcting and updating data when errors or omissions are identified [17]. Furthermore, quality assurance in critical processes like data labeling is paramount, as even a single incorrect label can negatively impact model performance [9]. Ideally, data annotators should possess subject matter expertise relevant to the domain the model addresses to ensure high accuracy [9]. Efforts towards safeguarding high-quality data development also involve ethical considerations, such as opposing discriminatory and exclusive data training, and advocating for collaborative development of high-quality datasets to foster AI advancement [36].​  

# 3.4 Data Governance and Management Frameworks  

Establishing clear data governance policies and procedures is paramount for ensuring data quality, security, and compliance, foundational elements for successful data-driven development [7,10]. A robust data strategy necessitates integrating data governance to uphold data integrity and security, precisely defining authorized actions on specific data under particular circumstances [7]. Such governance frameworks delineate the processes, roles, policies, standards, and metrics essential for effective data management throughout the data lifecycle [7].  

Key principles of data governance emphasize responsible data use, encompassing data privacy, protection, and ethics [12]. Setting clear principles and standards is critical for guiding the safe and responsible utilization of data, particularly big data, for development and humanitarian purposes [12]. Data quality standards are also implicitly recognized as integral to effective data governance, especially for improving the generalizability of data-driven applications, such as machine learning models in clinical contexts [23].  

Effective data management within these frameworks requires balancing the imperative for innovation with the inherent risk of data misuse during sharing [28]. This balance is achieved through instituting clear responsibilities, pragmatic access controls determined by specific use case requirements and priorities, and stringent adherence to data security, privacy, and retention policies [28]. Maintaining consumer trust and meeting legal requirements are critical outcomes of these measures [28]. Furthermore, company privacy policies should be transparent and easily comprehensible to data subjects [28].  

The concept of data stewardship is a vital component of modern data governance [8]. Designing institutional frameworks that position responsible data collaboration at the core of operations, involving both public and private sectors, includes the identification of chief data stewards tasked with leading collaborative initiatives [8]. The broader objective often involves cultivating a network of individuals dedicated to promoting sound data stewardship practices [8]. Implementing effective national data management, particularly for domains like environmental data, requires significant investment in adequate training, infrastructure, access to expertise, and engagement, highlighting the practical resource needs for establishing and maintaining robust governance structures [30]. Organizations such as the OECD operate under established governance and management frameworks to uphold data quality, security, and ethical usage, underscoring the institutionalization of these principles [5]. In contexts involving open data, governance extends to ensuring compliance with licensing terms, such as the requirement for explicit attribution to the Data Providing Organization [17].​  

# 3.5 Data Preservation  

The long-term usability and enduring value of high-value datasets for data-driven development are fundamentally reliant on robust data preservation strategies [35]. Effective preservation is critical for facilitating future research endeavors, enabling historical analysis, and ensuring the reproducibility of scientific findings [35]. Maintaining data integrity and accessibility over extended periods requires systematic approaches to archiving, versioning, and provenance tracking [9,27,34].  

Core practices in data preservation include data archiving, which involves securely storing data in formats and locations that ensure long-term accessibility and integrity [9]. Data versioning is essential for tracking changes to datasets over time, allowing users to identify specific versions used in analyses and facilitating reproducibility by linking results to the exact data state at a given point [9,34]. Furthermore, maintaining comprehensive data provenance records is crucial for understanding the origin, history, and processing steps applied to a dataset, thereby enhancing trust and facilitating validation [9,27]. Organizations like the OECD emphasize the importance of data archiving, versioning, and documentation to ensure long-term availability and usability, although specific tools are often not detailed [5].​  

Various tools and technologies support these preservation practices. Data archiving solutions range from physical media storage to cloud-based repositories, often incorporating checksums and migration strategies to counter media degradation and technological obsolescence [9]. Data versioning systems, frequently integrated with data management platforms, track modifications, annotate versions, and manage branching and merging of data pipelines [9]. Tools for data provenance tracking often build upon metadata management systems and workflow logs, recording data transformations, user actions, and source information to create an audit trail [27]. While specific tools are diverse and context-dependent [34], the implementation of such technical measures is vital for operationalizing preservation principles [9].  

Choosing among different preservation strategies necessitates careful consideration of associated costs and benefits. Factors influencing the decision include the volume and complexity of the data, required access frequency, security needs, regulatory compliance, and the expected lifespan of the data's value. While initial setup and ongoing maintenance of robust preservation systems can incur significant costs, the benefits derived from ensuring continued access, enabling future research, avoiding data loss, and maintaining scientific integrity generally outweigh these expenses, particularly for highvalue datasets where the cost of recreation or loss is prohibitively high.​  

# 4. Access, Sharing, and Interoperability  

Unlocking the full potential of high-value datasets for data-driven development fundamentally relies on ensuring their effective access, sharing, and interoperability. This section synthesizes insights into the challenges and mechanisms facilitating these critical aspects. The primary challenges highlighted include the fragmentation and siloed nature of existing  

data [3], making it incompatible across different systems and hindering efficient circulation and utilization [2,6,11,15].   
Addressing these issues requires robust policies, standards, and collaborative frameworks.  

A central model for promoting data accessibility and reuse is the adoption of open data principles. Open data is defined by its free availability for anyone to access, use, and distribute without significant legal or technical restrictions [24,25]. These principles, including accessibility, reusability, and transparency, are deemed crucial for enhancing the value and impact of datasets, fostering innovation, collaboration, and the creation of new services for societal and commercial benefit [13,25]. Initiatives range from Open Government Data portals in numerous countries [6,11] and by international bodies like the OECD [5,34], to corporate efforts and domain-specific projects [13,24,27]. Regional open data hubs play a vital role by tailoring global principles to local contexts, building capacity, and fostering collaboration among diverse stakeholders [21].  

The effectiveness of data sharing and reuse is significantly influenced by data sharing policies and licensing models. Open Government Data (OGD) licenses, such as the "Open Government Data License" v1.0, provide essential legal frameworks, defining user rights (utilization, modification, redistribution) and obligations (attribution) [17]. Compatibility with broader open content licenses, like Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International, facilitates wider interoperability [17]. Beyond open access, other models like restricted or controlled access exist [27], although the provided material focuses primarily on open paradigms and collaborative approaches such as data collaboratives, which facilitate sharing, often of private sector data, for public good purposes [8].​  

Interoperability is a fundamental requirement for maximizing data utility [3,5]. Establishing common data standards and metadata schemas is paramount for enabling seamless data integration and reuse across disparate systems and platforms [3,5,7]. Standardized data formats and comprehensive metadata enhance semantical interoperability and reduce the cost of accessing and manipulating data [25]. The absence of adequate standards creates significant friction [15] and impedes data liquidity and accessibility, thereby limiting innovation [2]. Efforts to cultivate national integrated data markets and establish standards for data circulation and trading are seen as critical for enabling data assetization and capitalization [2,33]. Continuous collaboration between industry and government is necessary to evolve standards effectively [15].​  

The value of accessible, sharable, and interoperable data is realized through its use by various social groups, each with distinct motivations [1]. These groups include technical experts seeking data for research and development, the private sector aiming to create business value, and government/civil society utilizing data for public services, advocacy, and addressing societal challenges [3,5,25,38]. Meeting the needs of these diverse users necessitates data that is not only accessible and licensed for reuse but also technically usable and semantically interoperable. Thus, addressing challenges related to data silos, lack of standards, and legal clarity through effective policies, licensing, and standardization is crucial for enabling data-driven development across all relevant social groups. The promotion of openness and shared benefit, as advocated in discussions around AI research resources, underscores the broader move towards facilitating access and collaboration in data and technology domains [36].​  

# 4.1 Open Data Principles and Initiatives  

Open Data represents a paradigm shift in data accessibility, defined as data freely available for anyone to access, use, and distribute without legal or technical barriers [25]. The core tenets of open data, including free use, modification, sharing, accessibility, reusability, and transparency, are fundamentally applicable to high-value datasets [9,25,34]. A central argument is that embracing these principles enhances the overall value and impact of such datasets [25]. By enabling unrestricted access and use, open data fosters collaboration, innovation, and the creation of new services that yield both social and commercial value [13,17,25]. This openness allows datasets to be integrated, analyzed, and repurposed in ways that may not have been initially envisioned, thereby unlocking latent potential and maximizing societal benefit [13].  

The commitment to open data principles by countries and organizations is often driven by the belief that openness promotes transparency, aids in combating corruption, and energizes civic engagement [25]. High-value datasets, particularly those generated by governments and international bodies, increasingly adhere to these principles, providing free access for various applications [6,11]. Licensing and governance models are crucial enablers of open access. For instance, the Open Government Data License facilitates the sharing and application of government data by granting users broad, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free rights to reproduce, distribute, transmit, modify, and adapt the data for any purpose, including creating derivative works, without requiring additional authorization [17]. This legal framework directly supports the practical implementation of open data principles.​  

Numerous initiatives globally promote open data, each with varying scopes, goals, and target users. Open Government Data initiatives, exemplified by platforms like Data.gov and Climate.data.gov, aim to make public sector information readily available to citizens, researchers, and businesses [6,16]. Their primary goals include transparency, improved government service efficacy, and facilitating public sector collaboration with entities like the private sector [17]. Corporate initiatives, such as those by Microsoft, focus on promoting open innovation and data governance through partnerships with industry, government, and civil society to empower users and providers to collaborate and create value for societal benefit [13,27]. Domain-specific efforts like the Open Food Data Hackdays aim to build publicly available databases and foster entrepreneurial use within particular sectors [24]. Other initiatives focus on leveraging big data for social good and sustainable development, including the GSMA’s “Big Data for Social Good,” Data for Climate Action, and Data Collaboratives, often involving cross-sectoral data sharing for specific public benefit outcomes [8,12]. Global networks such as OD4D (now D4DNet) have focused on advancing the understanding and impact of open data and supporting the evolution of open data ecosystems, particularly in developing countries [38]. While government initiatives often prioritize transparency and public service through governmental data, corporate and collaborative initiatives tend to emphasize innovation, cross-sector partnerships, and targeted societal outcomes, showcasing the diverse applications and stakeholders involved in the open data landscape.​  

International organizations play a significant role in advancing open data principles and standards. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) adheres to open data principles by making its statistical data freely available for use, modification, and sharing through initiatives like the OECD Data Explorer and API [5]. This practice sets a standard and provides infrastructure that promotes open access to high-value economic and social data. Similarly, the United Nations Statistics Division contributes to promoting open data, aligning its data practices with principles of free access and use, thereby advancing global statistical standards and data availability [6,34].  

The benefits of open data are extensive and well-documented across various initiatives. They range from promoting governmental transparency and accountability to stimulating economic growth through innovation and the creation of new data-driven services [17,25]. Open data facilitates research, energizes civic engagement, and supports efforts towards sustainable development and addressing global challenges like climate change [12,13,16,25]. By enabling data collaboratives, open data principles also support sharing private sector data for public good purposes [8]. Although the concept of open data presents significant challenges, such as ensuring data quality, privacy, security, and sustainability, the provided digests primarily focus on the benefits and the mechanisms supporting openness [25,27].​  

# 4.2 Regional Open Data Hubs and Ecosystems  

Regional open data hubs and ecosystems represent a crucial layer in the global infrastructure for data-driven development, acting as intermediaries that tailor global open data principles and practices to specific local and regional contexts [21]. These entities play vital roles in promoting open data adoption, building local and regional capacity, and fostering collaboration among diverse stakeholders. Analysis of prominent regional initiatives reveals varied approaches shaped by distinct geographical, political, and socio-economic landscapes [21].  

Across different regions, hubs such as the Africa Open Data Network (AODN) in Africa, ILDA in Latin America, the Caribbean Open Institute (COI), Data for Development Asia (D4Dasia) in Southeast Asia, the African Francophone Open Data Community (CAFDO), and Middle East and North Africa Data (MENAdata) demonstrate diverse strategies [21]. AODN, hosted in Kenya, focuses on scaling open data impact through policy adoption, partnerships, and innovation-oriented capacity building across Africa [21]. Similarly, ILDA in Latin America champions inclusive development and public innovation, emphasizing the ethical use of public data and building capacity within communities, with a specific focus on gender inclusion and public sector efficiency [21]. The COI adopts an open development approach in the Caribbean, utilizing open data as a catalyst for inclusion and innovation through advocacy, awareness, and specific capacity building efforts in data literacy and application [21].​  

Comparing these approaches, several common strategies and regional adaptations emerge [21]. Many hubs prioritize capacity building, though the focus varies; COI emphasizes data literacy and application, while ILDA targets community capacity building and ethical considerations [21]. Community and network building are central to most initiatives, connecting technologists, civil society, government, and researchers, as seen with D4Dasia in Southeast Asia and CAFDO in Francophone Africa, the latter of which specifically cultivates local leadership in 15 countries [21]. Advocacy and engagement with the public sector are also key, particularly for COI and CAFDO, which aims to provide tools for policymakers [21]. Furthermore, several hubs explicitly link open data initiatives to addressing specific development  

challenges, including AODN's focus on scaling impact, ILDA's drive for inclusive development, and MENAdata's emphasis on research and advocacy for long-lasting regional issues [21]. Research plays a significant role in informing strategies for D4Dasia, CAFDO, and MENAdata [21].  

These diverse regional initiatives collectively contribute to the global open data ecosystem by creating a distributed network of expertise and activity [21]. By adapting global principles to local needs and fostering region-specific communities of practice, they generate valuable insights and models that can inform efforts in other parts of the world. The MENAdata network, for instance, actively seeks stronger connections with international open data initiatives and partners, facilitating the cross-pollination of ideas and strategies [21]. Beyond these explicitly detailed hubs, the existence of initiatives like the Open Food Data Hackdays in Switzerland, supported by regional organizations such as Opendata.ch, further illustrates the presence and activity of diverse regional ecosystems promoting open data use cases [24]. While specific factors contributing to success or failure for each hub require deeper analysis beyond the scope of the provided digests, the outlined strategies—such as targeted capacity building, robust community engagement, policy advocacy, and aligning open data with regional development priorities—represent potential best practices in fostering vibrant regional open data ecosystems [21].  

# 4.3 Open Government Data and Licensing  

Open government data (OGD) encompasses all public sector data stored and made accessible by governments in the public interest without usage or distribution restrictions [25]. These datasets are characterized by being non-privacy-restricted and non-confidential, produced using public funds, and made available for free use and distribution [25]. The effective utilization and sharing of such data necessitate clear legal frameworks, primarily through open government data licenses.  

Open government data licenses are crucial for defining the legal and practical aspects governing the use of public datasets. The "Open Government Data License" v1.0 provides a notable example, delineating specific rights and obligations for both users and data providing organizations [17]. Under this license, users are typically granted extensive rights to utilize, modify, and redistribute the data. A key obligation for users is the requirement to provide explicit attribution to the original Data Providing Organization [17]. Failure to comply with this attribution requirement renders the license void [17]. The v1.0 license is designed for compatibility with established open content licenses, specifically aligning with the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 International [17], which facilitates broader data interoperability and reuse. For data providers, the license outlines conditions under which data provision may cease, such as changes in public interest or potential infringement of third-party rights [17]. Beyond governmental licenses, the broader landscape of data sharing includes various agreements, such as those proposed for AI training contexts (e.g., CDLA Permissive 2.0, C-UDA 1.0, DUA-OAI, DUA-DC), which aim to simplify and govern data exchange, although their specific application to OGD depends on the dataset's nature and source [27]. The need for standardized agreements highlights the legal complexities that can otherwise hinder data sharing [27].​  

The availability of government datasets is a global trend, with numerous countries establishing portals to disseminate public information. Examples of such portals exist in Europe, the United States, New Zealand, India, and Northern Ireland [11], as well as in the UK (e.g., UK Data Service) [6] and Switzerland (providing data like fresh product nutrition information) [24]. Organizations like the OECD also make significant datasets available under open licenses, supporting evidence-based policy [5]. Comparing government datasets across different countries is essential for understanding the landscape of available resources for data-driven development, considering factors such as accessibility, quality, and the range of data types offered [11,34]. While the presence of numerous portals indicates increasing accessibility, detailed comparisons regarding data granularity, update frequency, and overall quality often require in-depth analysis beyond mere availability.  

Government datasets play a fundamental role in fostering data-driven development by providing foundational information for research, policy analysis, and the creation of public services. Their accessibility under open licenses allows researchers, businesses, and the public to leverage this information for innovation. Furthermore, the proactive release of government data is a critical mechanism for promoting transparency and accountability [6,11]. By making data produced with public money openly available, governments enable scrutiny of their activities and empower citizens with information, aligning with the core principles of open data [25]. The diverse range of available government datasets, facilitated by various national and international portals [6,11], underscores their increasing importance as a high-value resource for societal and economic advancement.  

# 4.4 Data Standardization and Interoperability  

Data standardization and interoperability are recognized as fundamental requirements for maximizing the utility and value of datasets [3,5]. A primary objective of standardization is to ensure efficient data circulation, trading, development, utilization, and secure supervision, laying the groundwork for realizing data elements' inherent value [2]. The integration and reuse of data across disparate systems and platforms critically depend on establishing common standards and protocols [3,5].​  

Conversely, the absence of adequate market standards for data elements presents significant challenges, impeding data "liquidity" and "accessibility," which in turn limits innovation and the multiplier effects of data on economic development [2]. Lack of interoperability and harmonized technical standards can create friction, for instance, for consumers interacting with fintech products and services [15].  

Different data standards and metadata schemas are evaluated for their effectiveness in promoting data access and reuse. Standardized data formats and comprehensive metadata schemas are promoted to facilitate data sharing and integration across diverse platforms and organizations [5]. Specifically, metadata plays a crucial role in enhancing opportunities for semantical interoperability, thereby lowering the cost associated with accessing, manipulating, and sharing data across boundaries [25]. The adoption of APIs and structured protocols also implicitly necessitates a level of standardization to ensure seamless data access and usage [24].  

The importance of standardization is highlighted across various sectors. For example, standardizing data elements is central to improving local decision-making by making data more interoperable and usable across different jurisdictions and sectors [3]. In the fintech domain, interoperability and harmonized standards are advocated to reduce friction and foster innovation, necessitating close engagement between industry and government authorities as technologies evolve [15]. Furthermore, establishing standards and systems specifically for data circulation and trading is considered essential [33].  

Investigating the standardization path for data element market development reveals that it is perceived as critical for enabling data assetization and capitalization [2]. This path aims to structure data flows and transactions based on standardized layouts to ensure efficient circulation, trading, and utilization [2]. The challenges posed by inadequate standards directly impact the achievement of these goals, underscoring the need for a robust standardization framework to unlock the full potential of data elements as economic factors [2]. Continuous engagement between stakeholders, including industry and government, is suggested to ensure standards evolve effectively, fostering innovation while mitigating potential risks [15].  

# 4.5 Identifying Relevant Social Groups for Open Data Use  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Social Group</td><td>Primary Motivation / Use Case</td><td>Examples</td></tr><tr><td>Technical Experts / Researchers</td><td>Analysis, Model Development, Experimentation, Scientific Inquiry</td><td>Data Scientists, ML Practitioners, University Researchers</td></tr><tr><td>Private Sector</td><td>Creating Business Value, Developing Products/Services</td><td>Start-ups, Enterprises, Businesses using data for insights, new ventures</td></tr><tr><td>Government Officials / Policymakers</td><td>Evidence-based Decision- Making,Improve Public Services</td><td>Urban Planners, Policy Analysts,Government Agencies</td></tr><tr><td>Civil Society Organizations / Public</td><td>Transparency, Advocacy, Addressing Societal Issues</td><td>NGOs,Journalists, Citizens monitoring government, social activists</td></tr><tr><td>Marginalized Groups</td><td>Beneficiaries of data applications addressing disparities</td><td>Women in informal sector, poor, uneducated (challenges illuminated by data)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Understanding the diverse social groups that interact with open data is crucial for comprehending its impact and potential for data-driven development. Various studies identify distinct sets of stakeholders and users, each driven by specific motivations [1]. These groups encompass a broad spectrum, ranging from technical experts and private sector entities to government bodies, civil society organizations, and the general public [17,25,38].​  

A framework grounded in the theory of Relevant Social Groups (RSG) identifies five overarching motives for open data use based on an analysis of reported use cases: exploring for creativity, creating business value, enabling local citizen value, addressing global societal challenges, and advocating the open data agenda [1]. These motivational categories help in classifying the diverse groups mentioned in the literature.  

One significant category includes technical users such as IT specialists, researchers, data scientists, and machine learning practitioners [6,11,25]. Their primary motivations revolve around leveraging open data for analytical purposes, model development, experimentation, and general research [6,11,25]. For instance, researchers and ML practitioners seek curated datasets suitable for various tasks, driving scientific inquiry and technological advancement [6,11]. Participants in open data hackathons, often with strong technical backgrounds in computer science and engineering, are motivated by enhancing their skills, exploring technical challenges, and learning about specific data domains like open food and nutrition data [24]. These motivations align predominantly with the "exploring for creativity" category and, depending on the research focus, with either "addressing global societal challenges" or "enabling local citizen value" [1].​  

The private sector represents another key social group, including start-ups, small enterprises, and private companies [25,38]. Their motivation is centered on creating business value, utilizing open data to develop information services, build applications, and derive commercial benefits [1,25]. This group seeks data that can be integrated into products, services, or internal operations to gain a competitive advantage or generate revenue.​  

Government officials, policymakers, and planning/infrastructure decision-makers constitute a crucial group of open data users and often data providers [3,5,8,38]. Their motivations are primarily public oriented: enabling evidence-based decisionmaking, improving public services, enhancing infrastructure maintenance and development, fostering economic development, and increasing transportation options [3,5]. These objectives align strongly with "enabling local citizen value" and "addressing global societal challenges" [1]. Data collaboratives, for instance, benefit government officials and policymakers by providing data for public good initiatives [8].  

Civil society organizations, journalists, and the general public represent groups motivated by transparency, advocacy, and addressing societal issues [5,8,25,38]. Their engagement often stems from a desire to hold power accountable, inform the public, and contribute to social causes, mapping to "advocating the open data agenda", "enabling local citizen value", and "addressing global societal challenges" [1]. Participation in events like hackathons can also be driven by a commitment to the open data cause itself [24].  

While some groups are direct users, others are identified as relevant because their circumstances highlight the need for data to address disparities. For example, women and girls in the informal sector and marginalized populations excluded by factors such as language, poverty, or lack of education are groups whose challenges can be illuminated and potentially addressed through the application of data—even if they are not the primary data users themselves [12]. Their relevance underscores the "addressing global societal challenges" motive [1].​  

Comparing these motivations, technical users and businesses primarily seek data for functional or commercial application, requiring data that is technically usable, structured, and potentially valuable for analysis or product development [11,25]. Government and civil society groups, while also requiring usable data, are driven by public value and societal impact, often seeking data relevant to policy areas, social conditions, or public services [3,5]. These differing motives influence the types of data they prioritize (e.g., economic, demographic, environmental, infrastructure data) and the applications they build (e.g., business intelligence tools, scientific models, policy dashboards, public service apps, advocacy visualizations) [3].  

Synergies between these groups are evident in collaborative initiatives such as data collaboratives, which facilitate data sharing between the private sector and government for public benefit [8]. Similarly, multi-stakeholder networks involving governments, civil society, the private sector, and technical experts foster collaborative change through data use [38]. While the digests do not explicitly detail conflicts, the varied objectives and data needs among groups could potentially lead to tensions regarding data access, formats, priorities, or interpretation, reflecting inherent differences in their approaches to leveraging open data. Identifying these distinct social groups and their underlying motivations is thus fundamental to understanding the dynamics of open data use and its potential to drive development.  

# 5. Monetization and Economic Aspects  

The economic valuation and monetization of high-value datasets represent a crucial dimension of data‐driven development, necessitating an understanding of data's role as a transformative factor of production [2]. Recognizing data alongside traditional economic inputs like labor and capital highlights its increasing significance in driving economic growth, technological innovation, and industrial development, particularly emphasized in national strategies for boosting the digital economy [33]. Data exhibits unique characteristics, such as non‐competitiveness, partial excludability, synergy, increasing returns to scale, and positive externalities, which differentiate it from traditional factors and influence its economic treatment and potential [2]. This perspective has profound implications for economic policy, requiring focus on the development of the data industry infrastructure and recognizing data's potential to generate revenue and optimize operations [20,33].​  

Leveraging this potential involves implementing various data monetization strategies [4,20,28]. These strategies are typically classified into direct approaches, which generate revenue by selling data or data‐derived products (e.g., raw data sales, data‐as‐a‐service, targeted reports [4,20,24,28]), and indirect approaches, which focus on using data internally to improve business processes, enhance efficiency, and optimize operations leading to cost savings or increased productivity [4,20]. Further classification distinguishes between internal monetization, where data is used solely within the organization for decision‐making and process optimization, and external monetization, which involves offering data or data products/services to external entities [20,28]. Successful data monetization, particularly direct external strategies, often requires sophisticated understanding of both data volume and value, supported by centralized data expertise [28]. The benefits of data monetization include generating new revenue streams, achieving cost reductions, and improving operational efficiency [4,7,20].​  

Despite the opportunities, the monetization of data and the cultivation of a vibrant data element market face significant challenges. These challenges encompass technological hurdles related to data quality, interoperability, and security; institutional issues concerning unclear data ownership, regulatory uncertainty, and lack of standardized frameworks; and strategic considerations such as developing effective data valuation methodologies and building efficient trading systems [2,4]. The development of a data element market progresses through stages from data resource management to assetization and eventual capitalization, each presenting unique obstacles [2]. Obstacles to market efficiency are observed at the factor level (data quality, accessibility), industrial level (cross‐sector integration), and institutional level (regulation, standardization) [2]. Addressing these challenges requires targeted policy interventions, including clarifying ownership, developing valuation and pricing mechanisms, establishing secure trading platforms, and promoting a clear standardization path to enhance trust and reduce transaction costs [2]. Accelerating the cultivation of an integrated national data market is a key objective to overcome fragmentation and realize economies of scale [33].  

# 5.1 Data as a Key Factor of Production  

In the contemporary digital economy, there is increasing recognition of data's emergence as a fundamental factor of production, alongside traditional inputs like labor, capital, and land [2,9,27,34]. This viewpoint is supported by governmental initiatives and international organizations emphasizing data's pivotal role in driving economic growth and technological advancement [2,5,33]. The integration of data elements with artificial intelligence, technological innovation, and industrial development is considered essential for fostering high-quality economic development [33].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Characteristic</td><td>Data</td><td>Traditional Factors (e.g., Labor, Capital)</td><td>Implications for Economy/Policy</td></tr><tr><td>Rivalry</td><td>Non-competitive (can be used by multiple)</td><td>Rivalrous (use by one prevents use by another)</td><td>Enables broad diffusion, network effects</td></tr><tr><td>Excludability</td><td>Partially excludable (hard to fully control)</td><td>Often fully excludable</td><td>Challenges in ownership,value capture, security</td></tr><tr><td>Synergy</td><td>High (combining datasets increases</td><td>Often lower (additive value)</td><td>Encourages data integration and</td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>value)</td><td></td><td>collaboration</td></tr><tr><td>Returns to Scale</td><td>Increasing returns</td><td>Often diminishing or constant returns</td><td>Value grows disproportionately with scale and application</td></tr><tr><td>Externalities</td><td>Positive externalities</td><td>Can have both positive and negative</td><td>Benefits accrue beyond initial users, requires policy support</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Data possesses distinct characteristics that differentiate it from traditional factors of production. Key among these are noncompetitiveness, partial excludability, synergy, increasing returns to scale, and externality [2]. Unlike labor or physical capital, which are typically rivalrous (use by one party prevents simultaneous use by another), data can be used by multiple parties concurrently without depletion, exhibiting non-competitiveness. While traditional factors like land and capital are often fully excludable, data's excludability is often only partial, meaning controlling access can be challenging. Furthermore, data exhibits synergy, where combining different datasets can yield value exceeding the sum of their individual parts. Crucially, data often demonstrates increasing returns to scale; the value derived from a dataset can grow disproportionately as it is integrated with more data or applied to more use cases. Finally, data often generates externalities, impacting parties not directly involved in its collection or initial use [2]. These characteristics contrast significantly with the often diminishing or constant returns associated with incremental additions of labor or capital in traditional economic models.  

Treating data as a key factor of production has profound implications for economic development and policy-making. It necessitates focusing on the development of the data industry itself, encompassing collection, storage, processing, analysis, and application [33]. This perspective highlights the potential for data to generate revenue and improve business operations, implicitly supporting its role as a productive asset [20]. The increasing value contained within institutional datasets accumulated over time, often undiscovered until actively sought, underscores the economic potential [4]. Discoveries such as long-term trends, customer behavioral patterns, or subtle indicators of competitor strategies can justify significant investment in data management and analysis [4].​  

Managing and valuing data as an asset presents both opportunities and challenges. The opportunity lies in exploring new business models centered around creating and capturing value from digital activities, particularly through data [24]. Open data, for example, can foster an ecosystem of actors including businesses, suppliers, intermediaries, and developers, leading to the emergence of new infomediary models that translate data into actionable insights and services [24]. Data's potential to drive business innovation further reinforces its asset value [24]. However, valuing data is complex due to its noncompetitive nature, partial excludability, and the dependency of its value on context, analysis, and synergy with other data. Challenges include establishing appropriate data governance frameworks, ensuring data quality and interoperability, addressing privacy and security concerns, and developing standardized methods for data valuation that account for its unique economic characteristics. Despite these challenges, the potential for data to unlock significant economic value and drive innovation positions it as a critical factor in modern production and a central consideration for future economic policy.

5.2 Data Monetization Strategies (Direct, Indirect, Internal vs. External)  

Data monetization involves leveraging data assets to generate economic value, a critical aspect of data-driven development.   
Strategies for achieving this value can broadly be categorized as direct or indirect, and internal or external [4,20].  

Direct data monetization strategies involve generating revenue by selling or trading data itself or data-derived products and services [4]. Examples include the direct sale of raw data, providing access through data portals, or offering targeted services built upon data insights [4,24]. Real-world instances of direct monetization are seen in platforms like Walmart's Retail Link System, which facilitates data sharing with suppliers, and Alibaba's provision of targeted personal finance services based on user data [4]. Other approaches encompass selling data outright, wrapping analytics around existing products and services (e.g., dashboards providing metrics on customer sentiment), and developing sophisticated "big data as a service" business models [4,28]. Specific examples of data products include forecast reports and survey data sold externally [20]. The development of new applications and businesses based on open data also exemplifies direct, external monetization, with projects like Open receipts, Nutrimenu, and Jarvis the Nutritionist emerging as potential data-driven ventures [24]. A primary benefit of direct monetization is the creation of new revenue streams [4].​  

In contrast, indirect data monetization focuses on using data internally to improve business processes, enhance efficiency, and optimize operations, leading to cost savings or increased productivity rather than direct data sales [4]. This approach involves leveraging data to improve internal operations, enhance customer experience, optimize service delivery, identify waste, and improve safety [4]. Specific examples include using data for informed decision-making, streamlining supply chains, improving efficiency, and enhancing customer service [20]. A well-defined data strategy, fundamental to indirect monetization, supports business goals by enabling efficient resource utilization, avoiding duplicated efforts, and facilitating cross-team collaboration through centralized datasets [7]. Data collaboratives, while potentially facilitating external data sharing, can indirectly contribute to a company's value by boosting brand reputation, channeling R&D spending, increasing overall profits, and identifying new risks and opportunities [8]. Improving business processes is highlighted as an indirect strategy with immediate potential for monetary benefit [4]. The benefits of indirect monetization primarily revolve around operational improvements, cost reductions, and enhanced decision-making capabilities [7,20].​  

Beyond the direct/indirect distinction, data monetization strategies can also be classified by their scope: internal versus external [20,28]. Internal monetization involves utilizing data exclusively within the organization to drive informed decisionmaking and optimize internal processes, aligning closely with the benefits of indirect monetization like improved efficiency and resource utilization [7,20]. External monetization, conversely, involves offering data or data-driven products and services to external customers or partners, encompassing direct data sales, data-as-a-service models, or the creation of data-based external applications [20,24,28]. This is often the focus when developing new businesses or revenue streams from data [24]. The choice between internal and external strategies is influenced by factors such as overarching business goals [7], the target audience for the data or insights (internal teams versus external market), and the potential value that insights generated from the data can provide to customers [28]. Sophisticated models focusing on both data volumes and values are crucial for successful external, direct monetization strategies like selling supply chain reports to wholesalers [28].  

Measuring the monetary benefit of data monetization strategies is essential [4]. For indirect strategies, this often involves quantifying cost savings from efficiency gains, waste reduction, and optimized resource allocation [4,7,20]. Direct and external strategies measure benefit through generated revenue from data sales, data products, or services. For instance, one retail company aimed to grow revenue from selling real-time supply chain reports to account for $2 5 \%$ of their overall revenue [28]. Measurement also involves assessing the value created for customers through analytics, such as assisting merchants with customer segmentation and cross-sell analysis [28]. Overall, organizations must establish metrics to demonstrate the tangible economic impact of their data utilization efforts [4]. While benefits like new revenue streams, cost savings, and operational improvements are well-documented, detailed analysis of risks associated with specific strategies is less prominent in the literature reviewed.  

# 5.3 Cultivating the Data Element Market  

The cultivation of a robust data element market is essential for fostering data-driven development and enhancing production efficiency. This complex process unfolds through distinct stages, primarily involving the management of data resources, their transformation into data assets, and ultimately, their capitalization [2,9,27,34]. Accelerating the cultivation of a national integrated data market is identified as a key imperative [33].​  

Despite the significant opportunities presented by a functioning data element market, numerous obstacles impede its development. At the foundational level, challenges include unclear data ownership rules, which complicate data sharing and transaction [2]. Moving towards data assetization and capitalization, critical barriers emerge such as the lack of practical value assessment methodologies, imperfect pricing mechanisms, and an underdeveloped trading system [2]. These issues collectively contribute to an insufficient supply of high-quality data available for market exchange [2]. Furthermore, obstacles manifest at different operational levels: the factor level involves issues related to data quality and accessibility; the industrial level faces challenges in integrating data across sectors and developing data-driven business models; and the institutional level contends with regulatory uncertainty and lack of standardized frameworks [9,27,34].  

Effective approaches to cultivating the data element market must address these multifaceted challenges systematically. This necessitates key policy interventions and the establishment of robust regulatory frameworks. Policies should aim to clarify data ownership and usage rights, develop standardized methods for data valuation and pricing, and construct efficient and secure data trading platforms [2]. A critical component of market development is the establishment of a clear and widely adopted standardization path [2,9,27,34]. Standardization is essential for ensuring data interoperability, quality, and security, thereby building trust among market participants and reducing transaction costs. Efforts to accelerate the development of a national integrated market [33] imply a high-level strategic approach focusing on nationwide coordination and infrastructure development to overcome localized fragmentation and unlock economies of scale. Successfully navigating these stages and overcoming the identified obstacles through targeted policy and standardization is crucial for realizing the full potential of data as a productive economic factor.​

# 9. Conclusion  

This survey has highlighted the critical and expanding role of high-value datasets as foundational elements for data-driven development across diverse sectors [29]. High-value datasets possess transformative potential, serving as catalysts for innovation, engines of economic growth, and vital tools for driving social progress and addressing global challenges such as achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [12] and mitigating climate change. They are essential for strengthening the evidence base underpinning policymaking, particularly within rapidly evolving domains like the digital economy [32] and local infrastructure investment [3]. Furthermore, accessible and well-curated datasets are indispensable for advancing fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence, enabling breakthroughs in research and practical  

applications [6,11]. The growth of the digital economy, with core industries contributing significantly to GDP, underscores the increasing demand for and value of such data resources [33].  

Realizing the full potential of high-value datasets necessitates sustained investment in their creation, maintenance, and strategic management [7,33]. The process of data curation is not merely supplementary but fundamental, directly impacting the success or failure of data-driven initiatives, such as machine learning model performance [18]. Prioritizing data cleanliness and manageability is paramount for effective utilization [6]. Organizations must develop deliberate data strategies aligned with their overarching objectives to ensure efficient resource utilization and informed governance [7,18].  

However, the path to leveraging high-value datasets is fraught with significant challenges that require diligent attention. Foremost among these is ensuring robust data quality, which is critical for the performance, fairness, robustness, safety, and scalability of models, yet is frequently overlooked, particularly in specialized domains like healthcare machine learning [22,23]. Accessibility remains a persistent hurdle, characterized by data silos, a lack of data literacy among potential users, and insufficient multi-modal analysis tools [3,12]. Ethical considerations, including data misuse, issues of inequality, and inherent biases within datasets, demand rigorous address [12,36]. Therefore, establishing and implementing robust governance frameworks, clear policies, and standardized practices are crucial for fostering trust and enabling the responsible use of data [10,25,33]. Technological, institutional, and strategic complexities also pose challenges, for example, in areas like data monetization [4]. Even within areas like open source innovation, security risks and the need for enhanced evaluation persist [19].​  

To promote the responsible and effective use of high-value data for societal benefit, specific actions are needed from various stakeholders.  

• Policymakers and Governments: Should prioritize advancing data governance frameworks for development [10], actively work to bridge the digital divide, mitigate data misuse, and address inequality and bias [12]. They are encouraged to increase the supply of high-quality data, cultivate integrated data markets, and establish clear data circulation and trading standards [33]. Implementing effective open data policies and practices is critical [25], potentially including supporting digital public goods and fostering vibrant open source ecosystems [19]. Furthermore, governments can leverage data collaboratives to develop smarter policies [8] and must continue efforts to improve the measurement of the digital economy to strengthen evidence-based policy [32].  

• Researchers and Practitioners: Must place greater emphasis on data quality assessments and curation processes throughout the data lifecycle, particularly in applied domains like healthcare ML [18,23]. Developing comprehensive data strategies aligned with organizational goals is essential [7]. Future research should focus on tackling persistent technical and institutional challenges, such as overcoming data silos and improving data literacy [3]. Exploring and refining data monetization strategies and building relevant skills will be vital for leveraging data economically [4,20]. Methodologies like hackathons can serve as valuable tools for crowdsourcing innovation by leveraging open data [24].​  

• Stakeholders broadly: Need to engage in collaborative efforts across governments, organizations, and academic institutions to promote both the release and effective use of data [12,25]. Learning from past experiences, such as the financial crisis in the context of fintech, can help orient data-driven innovations toward broader societal benefit [15]. Fostering international cooperation and ensuring sustainable and responsible practices are paramount for harnessing the full potential of data and related technologies like AI and blockchain [29,36].  

Ultimately, advancing the use of data for development, with a focus on inclusivity, good governance, and economic growth, requires a collective and sustained effort [38]. By strategically investing in data infrastructure, addressing critical challenges related to quality, accessibility, ethics, and governance, and promoting collaborative action, societies can unlock the profound potential of high-value datasets to drive innovation and achieve significant societal benefits.
