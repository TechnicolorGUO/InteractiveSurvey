# Literature Survey: Causal Modeling for Longitudinal and Panel Data

## Introduction
Causal modeling is a cornerstone of modern statistical analysis, particularly when examining relationships between variables over time. Longitudinal and panel data provide unique opportunities to study causal effects due to their temporal structure, allowing researchers to disentangle causation from correlation. This survey explores the methodologies, challenges, and advancements in causal modeling specifically tailored for longitudinal and panel data.

## Background on Longitudinal and Panel Data
Longitudinal data refers to repeated observations of the same units (e.g., individuals, firms) over time, while panel data combines cross-sectional and time-series dimensions. These datasets are valuable for causal inference because they allow for the control of unobserved heterogeneity and the examination of dynamic processes. Key features include:
- **Time-varying covariates**: Variables that change over time.
- **Fixed and random effects**: Methods to account for unit-specific differences.
- **Temporal dependencies**: Relationships between past and future observations.

$$
Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{it},
$$
where $Y_{it}$ is the outcome for unit $i$ at time $t$, $X_{it}$ is the predictor, $\alpha_i$ represents individual-specific effects, and $\epsilon_{it}$ is the error term.

## Main Sections

### 1. Fixed Effects vs. Random Effects Models
Fixed effects models isolate within-unit variation to estimate causal effects, effectively controlling for all time-invariant confounders. In contrast, random effects models assume that individual-specific effects are uncorrelated with predictors, enabling more efficient estimation but requiring stronger assumptions.

| Model Type | Assumptions | Strengths |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Fixed Effects | Time-invariant confounders are controlled | Robust to omitted variable bias |
| Random Effects | Individual effects uncorrelated with predictors | More efficient estimates |

### 2. Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
The DiD approach compares changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group and a control group. It relies on the parallel trends assumption, which posits that, absent treatment, the average outcomes of the treated and control groups would have followed the same trajectory.

$$
Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Treated_i + \beta_2 Post_t + \beta_3 (Treated_i \times Post_t) + \epsilon_{it},
$$
where $Treated_i$ indicates whether unit $i$ is in the treatment group, and $Post_t$ indicates whether time $t$ is after the treatment.

### 3. Instrumental Variables (IV) and Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)
When endogeneity arises due to unmeasured confounders or reverse causality, IV methods can identify causal effects. A valid instrument must be correlated with the endogenous predictor but uncorrelated with the error term. The 2SLS procedure involves two regression steps to estimate the causal effect.

$$
\text{First stage: } X_{it} = \pi_0 + \pi_1 Z_{it} + u_{it},
$$
$$
\text{Second stage: } Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \hat{X}_{it} + \epsilon_{it},
$$
where $Z_{it}$ is the instrument and $\hat{X}_{it}$ is the predicted value from the first stage.

### 4. Structural Equation Models (SEMs)
SEMs extend traditional regression by incorporating latent variables and complex relationships among observed and unobserved constructs. They are particularly useful for panel data where multiple indicators measure underlying constructs.

$$
\eta = B\eta + \Gamma\xi + \zeta,
$$
where $\eta$ represents latent endogenous variables, $\xi$ represents latent exogenous variables, and $B$, $\Gamma$, and $\zeta$ define the structural relationships.

### 5. Bayesian Approaches
Bayesian methods offer flexibility in modeling longitudinal and panel data by incorporating prior distributions and uncertainty quantification. Hierarchical Bayesian models can account for both within-unit and between-unit variability.

$$
p(\theta | Y) \propto p(Y | \theta) p(\theta),
$$
where $p(\theta | Y)$ is the posterior distribution, $p(Y | \theta)$ is the likelihood, and $p(\theta)$ is the prior.

## Challenges and Limitations
Despite their strengths, causal models for longitudinal and panel data face several challenges:
- **Measurement error**: Imperfectly measured variables can bias estimates.
- **Dynamic treatment effects**: Treatment effects may vary over time, complicating interpretation.
- **Missing data**: Missing observations can lead to biased results if not properly addressed.

## Conclusion
Causal modeling for longitudinal and panel data provides powerful tools for understanding dynamic relationships and estimating causal effects. While classical methods like fixed effects and DiD remain widely used, advances in IV, SEMs, and Bayesian approaches continue to expand the toolkit for researchers. Future work should focus on addressing remaining challenges, such as robustness to violations of key assumptions and scalability to large datasets.
