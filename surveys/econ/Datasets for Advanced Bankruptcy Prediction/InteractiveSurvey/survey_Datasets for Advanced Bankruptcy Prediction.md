# 2 Introduction
The prediction of corporate bankruptcy is a critical area of financial research, with significant implications for investors, creditors, and regulatory bodies [1]. Accurate bankruptcy prediction can help in risk management, portfolio optimization, and financial decision-making, thereby reducing the economic impact of corporate failures [1]. Traditional methods, such as financial ratio analysis and actuarial models, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the complex and dynamic nature of financial distress. The advent of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning and ensemble methods, has opened new avenues for improving the accuracy and robustness of bankruptcy prediction models [1]. However, the effectiveness of these models is highly dependent on the quality and richness of the datasets used for training and validation. This survey paper focuses on the datasets and methodologies that have been employed in advanced bankruptcy prediction, providing a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in this field [2].

The primary research topic of this survey paper is the exploration of datasets and advanced machine learning techniques for bankruptcy prediction [3]. Specifically, we examine how various types of datasets, including financial statements, textual data, and network data, can be leveraged to enhance the predictive power of bankruptcy models [4]. We also delve into the methodologies used for feature selection, data balancing, and model evaluation, highlighting the challenges and best practices in each area. The survey aims to provide a detailed understanding of the current landscape of bankruptcy prediction, with a focus on the datasets and techniques that have shown the most promise [3].

The paper begins by discussing advanced neural network architectures, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which have become essential tools in time series forecasting, particularly in financial applications [5]. We explore how these architectures can capture long-term dependencies and handle sequential data, making them well-suited for financial time series analysis [6]. We also examine Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which offer unique strengths in capturing local patterns and complex interdependencies, respectively. The integration of these models in hybrid and ensemble methods is also discussed, highlighting their ability to combine the strengths of multiple models and improve predictive accuracy.

Next, we delve into data augmentation and feature engineering techniques, such as synthetic data generation and adversarial learning, which are crucial for enhancing the robustness and generalization of machine learning models. We explore how these techniques can address the limitations of traditional datasets, particularly in scenarios where real data is limited or biased. The role of sentiment analysis and expert tracing in financial market prediction is also examined, emphasizing the importance of unstructured data sources such as social media and news articles in capturing market sentiment and identifying influential market participants.

The paper further discusses the evaluation and comparison of different machine learning models, focusing on performance metrics, sensitivity analysis, and backtesting. We highlight the importance of a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes both real-world and synthetic datasets to ensure that models are robust and adaptable to different market conditions. The integration of large language models (LLMs) in financial analysis is also explored, particularly in the context of data integration and multi-modal analysis, where LLMs can fuse textual and numerical data to provide deeper insights into financial health.

Finally, we address the challenges of model explainability and transparency, discussing both model-agnostic and model-specific explainable AI (XAI) techniques. The empirical analysis of LLM biases and the application of utility theory in economic forecasting are also covered, emphasizing the need for careful calibration and validation of models to ensure their reliability and fairness [7]. The paper concludes with a discussion on future directions and the potential for further advancements in the field of bankruptcy prediction, particularly in the areas of data collection, model interpretability, and the integration of real-time data [3].

Second, it highlights the challenges and best practices in data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, guiding the development of more robust and reliable prediction models. Third, it discusses the role of explainability and transparency in financial modeling, emphasizing the importance of trust and accountability in AI systems. Overall, this survey paper aims to advance the field of bankruptcy prediction by synthesizing current knowledge and identifying areas for future research [2].

# 3 Time Series Forecasting with Deep Learning

## 3.1 Advanced Neural Network Architectures

### 3.1.1 Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their advanced variant, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have become indispensable tools in time series forecasting, particularly in financial applications [5]. RNNs are designed to handle sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from past inputs, enabling them to model temporal dependencies [8]. However, vanilla RNNs often struggle with the vanishing gradient problem, which hinders their ability to learn long-term dependencies. LSTM networks address this issue through a sophisticated gating mechanism that regulates the flow of information through the network. Specifically, LSTMs incorporate three gates: the input gate, which determines what new information to store in the cell state; the forget gate, which decides what information to discard from the cell state; and the output gate, which controls what part of the cell state is output as the hidden state.

In the context of financial time series, LSTMs have demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional machine learning models and other deep learning architectures such as Residual Networks (ResNets) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) [5]. This is particularly evident when LSTMs are trained on raw Open-High-Low-Close-Volume (OHLCV) data, where they achieve comparable or better performance without the need for complex feature engineering. The ability of LSTMs to capture long-term dependencies is crucial for financial forecasting, as market trends and patterns often span extended periods [6]. Our study reveals that the optimal window size for training LSTMs varies with the hidden size of the model, challenging the conventional wisdom that fixed window lengths are universally applicable. This finding underscores the importance of hyperparameter tuning in achieving the best performance.

Despite their advantages, LSTMs are not without limitations. As the length of the input sequences increases, LSTMs become computationally expensive and can suffer from gradient vanishing and exploding problems, which can impede training and reduce model effectiveness [9]. To mitigate these issues, recent research has explored the use of more efficient architectures, such as the Transformer, which employs self-attention mechanisms to model long-range dependencies in a parallelized manner [6]. However, LSTMs remain a powerful and widely used tool in financial time series analysis, particularly for tasks that require capturing complex temporal dynamics and long-term dependencies [6].

### 3.1.2 Convolutional Neural Networks and Graph Neural Networks
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools in the domain of financial time series analysis, each addressing specific challenges and leveraging unique strengths. CNNs, originally designed for image processing, have been adapted to time series data by treating sequences as one-dimensional images [6]. Their hierarchical convolutional layers excel at capturing local patterns and short-term dependencies, making them particularly useful for identifying immediate market reactions to news, economic indicators, and other transient events [6]. However, the inherent limitation of CNNs lies in their restricted receptive fields, which limit their ability to model long-term dependencies and broader trends [6].

In contrast, GNNs offer a more flexible and scalable approach by representing financial data as graphs, where nodes correspond to assets or market participants, and edges represent relationships such as correlations or causal links. This graph-based representation allows GNNs to capture complex interdependencies and propagate information across the network, enhancing the model's ability to understand and predict market dynamics. GNNs are particularly advantageous in scenarios involving multiple interacting assets, such as portfolio optimization and risk management, where the relationships between assets play a crucial role in decision-making.

To further enhance the capabilities of these models, hybrid architectures combining CNNs and GNNs have been explored. For instance, CNNs can be used to extract local features from individual time series, while GNNs can integrate these features across a network of interconnected assets. This combination leverages the strengths of both approaches, enabling the model to capture both short-term local patterns and long-term global dependencies. Such hybrid models have shown promise in improving the accuracy and robustness of financial predictions, particularly in dynamic and volatile markets.

### 3.1.3 Hybrid and Ensemble Methods
Hybrid and ensemble methods in financial time series forecasting combine the strengths of multiple models to improve predictive accuracy and robustness. These methods leverage the complementary capabilities of different algorithms, such as traditional statistical models and modern deep learning techniques, to capture a broader range of temporal dependencies and non-linear patterns. For instance, ensemble methods like stacking, bagging, and boosting can integrate the outputs of diverse models, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), exponential smoothing, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to produce more accurate and stable forecasts. By combining these models, hybrid and ensemble methods can mitigate the limitations of individual models, such as the inability of ARIMA to capture non-linear relationships and the tendency of RNNs to suffer from vanishing gradients.

One notable approach is the use of hybrid models that integrate deep learning architectures with traditional statistical techniques. For example, a hybrid model might use an LSTM network to capture long-term dependencies in the data, while a classical ARIMA model handles short-term trends and seasonality. This combination allows the model to effectively address the complexities of financial time series, which often exhibit both long-term and short-term patterns. Additionally, ensemble methods can incorporate domain-specific knowledge and feature engineering, enhancing the model's ability to adapt to different market conditions and data characteristics. The integration of these diverse components not only improves predictive performance but also increases the interpretability of the model, making it more useful for practical applications in finance.

Another key aspect of hybrid and ensemble methods is their ability to handle the inherent noise and volatility in financial data. By leveraging multiple models, these methods can reduce the impact of outliers and noisy data points, leading to more reliable predictions. For instance, ensemble methods can use techniques like cross-validation and bootstrapping to ensure that the model is robust and generalizes well to unseen data. Furthermore, the use of hybrid models that combine different types of input data, such as technical indicators, fundamental data, and textual sentiment, can provide a more comprehensive view of the market, thereby improving the overall predictive accuracy. Despite these advantages, the development and tuning of hybrid and ensemble models can be computationally intensive and require careful consideration of model architecture, training procedures, and hyperparameter optimization.

## 3.2 Data Augmentation and Feature Engineering

### 3.2.1 Synthetic Data Generation and Adversarial Learning
Synthetic data generation and adversarial learning have emerged as powerful techniques to address the limitations of traditional machine learning models in financial forecasting. Synthetic data generation involves creating artificial datasets that mimic the statistical properties of real-world financial data, thereby providing a controlled environment for training and testing models. This approach is particularly useful when real data is limited, noisy, or biased, as it allows researchers to generate large, balanced datasets that can improve the robustness and generalization of predictive models. By carefully designing the synthetic data to include various market conditions and anomalies, researchers can ensure that models are better prepared to handle the complexities and uncertainties of real financial markets.

Adversarial learning, on the other hand, is a framework that involves training two models simultaneously: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and synthetic data. This adversarial process forces the generator to produce increasingly realistic synthetic data, which can then be used to train other models. In the context of financial forecasting, adversarial learning can help in generating synthetic market scenarios that are difficult to predict, thereby improving the model's ability to handle rare or extreme events. This is particularly important in financial markets, where rare events can have significant impacts on asset prices and market dynamics.

The integration of synthetic data generation and adversarial learning has shown promising results in enhancing the performance of deep learning models, such as LSTMs and Transformers, in financial forecasting. By using synthetic data to augment real datasets, these models can achieve better generalization and higher accuracy in predicting market trends and asset prices. Moreover, the adversarial training process can help in identifying and mitigating biases in the training data, leading to more reliable and robust predictive models. This combination of techniques is expected to play a crucial role in advancing the field of financial machine learning, enabling more accurate and reliable predictions in complex and dynamic market environments [10].

### 3.2.2 Sentiment Analysis and Expert Tracing
Sentiment analysis plays a pivotal role in financial market prediction by capturing the attitudes and emotions of market participants, which can significantly influence stock prices. In this section, we explore the application of sentiment analysis techniques, particularly in the context of unstructured data sources such as social media, news articles, and blockchain messages [11]. Traditional methods, such as rule-based and lexicon-based approaches (e.g., VADER and TextBlob), have been widely used for sentiment analysis. However, these methods often struggle with the nuanced and context-dependent nature of financial text, leading to inaccuracies in sentiment classification. To address these limitations, recent studies have leveraged transformer-based models, such as BERT, which are fine-tuned on large datasets of financial text to capture more complex and context-specific sentiments. These models have demonstrated superior performance in identifying subtle market sentiments, thereby enhancing the predictive power of financial models.

In parallel with sentiment analysis, expert tracing has emerged as a complementary approach to identify influential market participants and their trading patterns [12]. Expert tracing involves the identification of individuals or entities whose trading activities and opinions have a significant impact on market dynamics. This is particularly relevant in the context of social media platforms, where influential users can sway market sentiment and, consequently, stock prices [12]. The challenge in expert tracing lies in distinguishing true experts from noise, especially in the presence of large volumes of unstructured data. To this end, dynamic expert tracing algorithms have been developed, which use machine learning techniques to identify and track influential market participants over time. These algorithms often incorporate features such as trading frequency, profitability, and consistency to identify experts and inverse experts (those whose predictions are consistently incorrect) [12]. By integrating sentiment analysis with expert tracing, researchers can gain deeper insights into market dynamics and improve the accuracy of stock price predictions.

The combination of sentiment analysis and expert tracing has shown promising results in various financial applications, including stock price prediction and trading strategy development. For instance, studies have demonstrated that incorporating sentiment scores from social media and news articles, along with expert opinions, can enhance the performance of predictive models. This integrated approach not only improves the accuracy of predictions but also provides actionable insights for traders and investors. However, the success of these methods depends on the quality and relevance of the data sources, as well as the robustness of the machine learning models used. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated algorithms that can handle the increasing complexity and volume of financial data, while also addressing the challenges of data quality and model interpretability.

### 3.2.3 Order Flow Measures and Hawkes Processes
Order flow measures are critical in understanding the dynamics of financial markets, particularly in the context of limit order books (LOBs). These measures capture the flow of buy and sell orders, providing insights into market liquidity, volatility, and the behavior of market participants. One of the most sophisticated approaches to modeling order flow is through the use of Hawkes processes, which are self-exciting point processes that can capture the clustering and self-excitation properties of financial events. Hawkes processes are particularly well-suited for modeling the temporal dependencies in order flow data, where past events can influence the likelihood of future events.

In the context of financial markets, a univariate linear Hawkes process can be defined by its conditional intensity function, which describes the instantaneous rate of event occurrence at any given time, conditioned on the history of past events [13]. This intensity function is typically modeled as a base rate plus a sum of excitation terms, each of which represents the impact of a past event on the current intensity. The excitation terms are often parameterized by a kernel function, which can be exponential, power-law, or other forms depending on the specific characteristics of the market being studied. By estimating the parameters of the Hawkes process, researchers can gain insights into the underlying market dynamics, such as the degree of self-excitation and the decay of event impacts over time [13].

Recent studies have extended the application of Hawkes processes to more complex order flow measures, such as order flow imbalances and the decomposition of market events into add, cancel, and trade events [13]. These advanced measures provide a more nuanced view of market activity and can be used to predict mid-price movements and other market outcomes. For example, by decomposing the order flow into its constituent parts, researchers can identify the specific types of events that drive market movements and the conditions under which these movements are most likely to occur. This information is valuable for developing trading strategies and risk management models, particularly in the context of high-frequency trading and algorithmic trading systems.

## 3.3 Model Evaluation and Comparison

### 3.3.1 Performance Metrics and Sensitivity Analysis
Performance metrics and sensitivity analysis play a crucial role in evaluating the effectiveness and robustness of financial prediction models. Commonly used performance metrics include the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which quantify the deviation between predicted and actual values. Additionally, metrics such as the Sharpe ratio and the Information Coefficient (IC) are employed to assess the risk-adjusted returns and the predictive power of the models, respectively. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of model performance, enabling researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions.

Sensitivity analysis is essential for understanding how changes in input parameters affect model outputs. This analysis helps in identifying the most influential features and parameters, thereby guiding the optimization of model configurations. Techniques such as partial dependence plots and permutation feature importance are commonly used to visualize and quantify the impact of individual features on model predictions. Sensitivity analysis also aids in detecting overfitting and ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data. By systematically varying input parameters, researchers can assess the stability and reliability of the model, which is particularly important in financial applications where small changes can lead to significant differences in outcomes.

In the context of financial time series prediction, sensitivity analysis can reveal the model's responsiveness to different market conditions and data characteristics. For instance, models trained on highly volatile markets may exhibit different sensitivities compared to those trained on stable markets. Understanding these sensitivities is crucial for developing robust trading strategies and risk management practices. Moreover, sensitivity analysis can help in fine-tuning hyperparameters and selecting appropriate model architectures, such as choosing between LSTM and GRU networks based on their performance and training efficiency. Overall, a thorough performance evaluation and sensitivity analysis ensure that the models are not only accurate but also reliable and adaptable to changing market dynamics.

### 3.3.2 Backtesting and Real-Time Simulations
Backtesting and real-time simulations are critical components in evaluating the performance and robustness of financial models, particularly those involving deep learning architectures like LSTMs [14]. In the context of financial time series analysis, backtesting involves simulating the performance of a model using historical data to assess its predictive accuracy and stability over different market conditions. This process is essential for validating the model's ability to generalize beyond the training data and to identify potential overfitting issues. For LSTM models trained on raw OHLCV data, backtesting has shown that optimal window sizes can vary significantly with the model's hidden size, challenging the conventional wisdom of using fixed window lengths [10]. This variability underscores the importance of adaptive window selection strategies in enhancing model performance.

Real-time simulations, on the other hand, focus on the model's ability to make accurate predictions in a live trading environment. These simulations are designed to mimic the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of financial markets, where the model must process and react to new data in real-time. The sequential nature of LSTMs makes them well-suited for real-time applications, as they can maintain a memory of past data points and use this information to inform current predictions [6]. However, this strength is also a limitation, as LSTMs can become computationally expensive and suffer from gradient vanishing and exploding problems when dealing with very long sequences [6]. To mitigate these issues, various techniques such as gradient clipping and the use of more efficient architectures like GRUs have been explored. Despite these challenges, LSTMs have consistently outperformed other deep learning architectures like ResNet and TCN in financial time series forecasting, highlighting their effectiveness in capturing complex temporal dependencies [6].

The integration of backtesting and real-time simulations in the evaluation framework provides a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance. Backtesting helps in identifying the optimal model configurations and hyperparameters, while real-time simulations ensure that the model can handle the high-frequency and low-latency requirements of live trading. The combination of these two approaches is crucial for developing robust and reliable financial models. Additionally, the use of synthetic datasets in real-time simulations can help in stress-testing the model under a wide range of market conditions, further enhancing its robustness and adaptability. Overall, the synergy between backtesting and real-time simulations is vital for advancing the field of financial time series analysis and improving the practical applicability of deep learning models in trading and investment strategies [14].

### 3.3.3 Comparative Studies and Benchmarking
In the realm of comparative studies and benchmarking, the evaluation of various models and techniques is crucial for advancing the field of time series analysis and financial forecasting. This section delves into the methodologies employed to assess the performance of different models, including traditional statistical methods, deep learning architectures, and hybrid models. The primary focus is on the robustness, accuracy, and scalability of these models when applied to diverse datasets, such as stock market indices and synthetic time series. The evaluation metrics used in these studies include mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and the Sharpe ratio, which collectively provide a comprehensive assessment of model performance.

To ensure a fair comparison, the experimental setup is meticulously designed to maintain consistent parameter settings across all models. For instance, the same hyperparameters are used for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and gated recurrent units (GRUs). This approach allows for a direct comparison of the inherent capabilities of each model architecture. Additionally, the use of both real-world and synthetic datasets provides insights into how well these models generalize to different types of data. The synthetic datasets, which mimic weekly activities with varying levels of complexity, serve as a controlled environment to test the models' ability to capture temporal patterns and long-term dependencies.

The results of these comparative studies highlight the strengths and limitations of each model. For example, while LSTM and GRU models exhibit comparable performance in capturing long-term dependencies, GRUs are often found to train faster, making them a preferred choice for applications requiring rapid prototyping and deployment. Furthermore, the introduction of hybrid models that combine classical statistical techniques with deep learning architectures has shown significant improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency. These findings underscore the importance of tailoring model selection to the specific characteristics of the dataset and the computational resources available. The benchmarking results also emphasize the need for ongoing research to develop more sophisticated models that can handle the increasing complexity and volume of financial data.

# 4 Large Language Models in Financial Analysis

## 4.1 Data Integration and Multi-Modal Analysis

### 4.1.1 Text and Numerical Data Fusion
Text and numerical data fusion has emerged as a critical area of research, particularly in the context of financial and business intelligence applications. This section explores the methodologies and techniques used to integrate textual and numerical data, highlighting the challenges and opportunities associated with this fusion. Traditional approaches to data fusion often involve feature concatenation, where textual features derived from natural language processing (NLP) techniques are combined with numerical features from structured data sources. However, this simplistic approach can lead to suboptimal performance due to the heterogeneity and high dimensionality of the data. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly the advent of transformer-based models, have opened new avenues for more sophisticated fusion mechanisms.

Transformer models, with their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information, have been successfully applied to fuse text and numerical data. For instance, in the domain of financial forecasting, transformer models can simultaneously process textual data from earnings calls and numerical data from financial statements, enabling a more holistic understanding of company performance. Techniques such as attention mechanisms allow the model to weigh the importance of different features dynamically, leading to more accurate predictions. Additionally, hybrid models that combine transformers with traditional machine learning algorithms, such as gradient boosting or support vector machines, have shown promise in improving predictive performance while maintaining interpretability.

Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in the field of text and numerical data fusion. One major challenge is the alignment of textual and numerical data, especially when dealing with asynchronous or incomplete data sources. Methods such as temporal alignment and data imputation are essential to ensure that the fused data accurately reflects the underlying relationships. Another challenge is the interpretability of the fused models, as the complexity of deep learning architectures can make it difficult to understand the decision-making process. Research efforts are ongoing to develop explainable AI (XAI) techniques that can provide insights into how the models integrate and utilize the different types of data [15]. Overall, the fusion of text and numerical data holds significant potential for enhancing the accuracy and robustness of predictive models in various domains.

### 4.1.2 Earnings Call Transcripts and Market Variables
Earnings call transcripts serve as a rich source of qualitative and quantitative data, offering insights into a company's financial health, strategic direction, and market positioning [16]. These transcripts typically include discussions led by senior executives, analysts, and investors, covering topics such as revenue growth, profit margins, operational efficiencies, and market trends. The integration of earnings call transcripts with market variables, such as stock prices, trading volumes, and volatility indices, provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing the impact of corporate communications on financial markets [16]. Advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition, are increasingly employed to extract meaningful signals from these transcripts, enhancing the predictive power of financial models.

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of textual data from earnings calls in forecasting stock price movements and market reactions [16]. For instance, the language and tone used during these calls can signal future performance, with positive sentiment often correlating with subsequent stock appreciation and negative sentiment with declines. Additionally, the disclosure of forward-looking guidance, such as earnings forecasts and strategic initiatives, can significantly influence investor sentiment and market expectations. By combining textual analysis with traditional financial metrics, researchers and practitioners can develop more robust models for predicting market outcomes, identifying potential investment opportunities, and managing portfolio risks.

However, the application of NLP techniques to earnings call transcripts presents several challenges, including the variability in language use, the presence of jargon and technical terms, and the need for context-aware analysis. To address these issues, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in handling complex textual data, providing deeper insights into the nuances of corporate communications. Despite these advancements, there remains a need for further research to refine and validate these models, particularly in emerging markets where the availability of high-quality data and the unique characteristics of local financial environments pose additional challenges. The development of specialized datasets, such as the MiMIC dataset for Indian markets, is crucial for advancing the field and ensuring that models are tailored to specific regional contexts.

### 4.1.3 Cross-Asset Risk Management
Cross-Asset Risk Management (CARM) is an advanced framework designed to address the complexities of managing risks across diverse financial instruments, including equities, fixed income, and currency markets. This framework leverages the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to integrate and analyze vast amounts of data from various sources, such as financial news, market reports, and economic indicators. By synthesizing these data points, LLMs can provide real-time insights and contextual understanding, enabling financial institutions to make more informed and timely risk management decisions [17]. The dynamic nature of CARM allows for continuous monitoring and adjustment, which is crucial in rapidly changing market conditions.

The integration of LLMs in CARM offers several advantages over traditional risk management approaches. Unlike static models that rely on historical data and predefined rules, LLMs can adapt to new information and evolving market trends. This adaptability is particularly important in identifying emerging risks that may not be apparent through conventional methods. For instance, LLMs can detect subtle changes in market sentiment or economic policies that could impact asset prices, allowing risk managers to proactively adjust their strategies. Additionally, the use of LLMs enhances the interpretability of risk assessments, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and act on the insights provided. This transparency is crucial for building trust and ensuring regulatory compliance.

Furthermore, CARM frameworks can be extended to incorporate multi-modal data, such as textual, numerical, and time-series information, to provide a more comprehensive view of risk. This multi-modal approach is particularly useful in scenarios where different types of data can offer complementary insights. For example, textual analysis of earnings calls and financial news can be combined with quantitative market data to predict stock price movements more accurately. The ability to integrate and analyze such diverse data sources not only improves the accuracy of risk assessments but also enhances the robustness of risk management strategies. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs and multi-modal data, CARM represents a significant advancement in the field of financial risk management.

## 4.2 Explainability and Transparency

### 4.2.1 Model-Agnostic vs Model-Specific XAI Techniques
Model-agnostic and model-specific XAI techniques represent two distinct approaches to enhancing the interpretability of machine learning models [15]. Model-agnostic methods are designed to be applicable across a wide range of models, including those with complex architectures such as deep neural networks and ensemble models. These techniques, such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), focus on providing explanations by approximating the model's behavior locally or globally through simpler, interpretable models. The advantage of model-agnostic methods lies in their flexibility and broad applicability, making them valuable for understanding and debugging a wide variety of models without requiring deep knowledge of the underlying architecture.

In contrast, model-specific XAI techniques are tailored to the unique characteristics and structures of specific types of models. For example, decision tree visualization and feature importance scores in random forests are model-specific methods that leverage the inherent interpretability of decision trees. Similarly, for neural networks, techniques like saliency maps and activation maximization provide insights by highlighting the input features that most influence the model's output. Model-specific techniques often offer more detailed and precise explanations, as they can directly utilize the model's internal mechanisms. However, this specificity can limit their applicability to other types of models, making them less versatile than model-agnostic methods.

The choice between model-agnostic and model-specific XAI techniques depends on the specific requirements of the application. Model-agnostic methods are preferred when the model type is unknown or varies, and when a general understanding of the model's behavior is sufficient. Model-specific techniques, on the other hand, are more suitable when deep insights into the model's internal workings are necessary, such as in high-stakes applications where transparency and accountability are critical. Balancing the trade-offs between flexibility and depth of explanation is crucial for effective model interpretation and trust-building in AI systems [15].

### 4.2.2 Empirical Analysis of LLM Biases
Empirical analysis of biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical area of research, particularly as these models are increasingly integrated into various decision-making processes. Studies have shown that LLMs can exhibit biases similar to those observed in human decision-making, such as over-extrapolation from recent trends and irrational economic behavior [7]. For instance, Ross, Kim, and Lo (2024) applied utility theory to evaluate the economic biases in LLMs, revealing that these models often fail to act rationally in economic contexts, deviating from both optimal and human-like behaviors [7]. This finding underscores the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive these biases, as they can significantly impact the reliability and fairness of LLM-generated recommendations.

Further empirical research has focused on the specific types of biases that LLMs exhibit in different applications. Chen et al. (2024) investigated how LLMs forecast stock returns and found that these models tend to over-extrapolate from recent market trends, leading to inaccurate predictions. This over-reliance on recent data can result in suboptimal investment decisions, highlighting the need for more sophisticated methods to mitigate such biases. Additionally, the influence of training data on LLM biases has been explored, with studies indicating that the composition and quality of training data play a crucial role in shaping the model's behavior. For example, LLMs trained on biased or skewed datasets are more likely to produce biased outputs, emphasizing the importance of careful data curation and preprocessing.

To address these biases, researchers have proposed various methodologies, including the development of benchmark datasets and the application of debiasing techniques. The creation of annotated datasets, such as BASIR (Budget-Assisted Sectoral Impact Ranking), which combines numerical and textual data from budget transcripts, provides a valuable resource for evaluating LLM performance in specific economic contexts [18]. Moreover, the use of domain-specific metrics, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, has been advocated to assess the discriminatory power of LLMs in distinguishing between different economic events. These empirical analyses not only help in identifying the sources of biases but also inform the development of more robust and fair LLMs, ultimately enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios.

### 4.2.3 Utility Theory and Economic Forecasting
Utility theory provides a foundational framework for understanding how individuals make economic decisions, particularly in the context of risk and uncertainty. In recent years, the application of utility theory to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has revealed intriguing insights into the economic biases inherent in these models. Ross, Kim, and Lo (2024) demonstrated that LLMs' economic behavior deviates from both full rationality and human-like decision-making, suggesting that these models may not always align with traditional economic theories. This deviation is particularly evident in their handling of complex economic scenarios, where LLMs often exhibit biases similar to those observed in human decision-making, such as over-extrapolation from recent trends.

S. Chen et al. (2024) further explored the implications of these biases in the context of stock return forecasting. Their study found that LLMs tend to over-extrapolate recent market movements, leading to suboptimal predictions. This over-extrapolation can be attributed to the models' reliance on historical data and their tendency to overweight recent information, a phenomenon known as recency bias. These findings highlight the importance of carefully calibrating LLMs to account for such biases, especially when they are used for economic forecasting [7]. The authors also suggested that incorporating more sophisticated economic models and external data sources could help mitigate these biases and improve the accuracy of LLM-based forecasts.

In another line of research, several studies have utilized LLMs to forecast a variety of economic series, including GDP growth, inflation rates, and unemployment figures [7]. J. Chen et al. (2023), Bond, Klok, and Zhu (2024), Tan, Wu, and Zhang (2024), and Jha et al. (2025) have all reported promising results, with LLMs demonstrating the ability to capture complex economic dynamics and provide valuable insights. However, these studies also caution against over-reliance on LLMs for economic forecasting, emphasizing the need for rigorous validation and the integration of domain expertise [7]. The application of utility theory in this context underscores the importance of understanding the underlying decision-making processes of LLMs and the potential for these models to influence economic outcomes.

## 4.3 Frameworks and Applications

### 4.3.1 Unified Mathematical Frameworks for Performance Metrics
Unified Mathematical Frameworks for Performance Metrics aim to establish a comprehensive and coherent approach to evaluating the effectiveness of models across various domains, particularly in classification tasks such as churn prediction, fraud detection, and spam filtering. These frameworks integrate a diverse array of performance metrics, including classification accuracy, F1 score, Type I and Type II errors, and ROC curves, to provide a multi-faceted assessment of model performance [1]. The primary goal is to develop a theoretical foundation that not only quantifies the performance of models but also elucidates the conditions under which certain metrics are more advantageous than others.

One of the key aspects of these frameworks is the derivation of theoretical bounds and the establishment of conditions under which relative metrics outperform absolute metrics. Relative metrics, such as those based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, are particularly useful in noisy environments where absolute metrics may be less reliable. By providing a principled approach to performance evaluation, these frameworks help in the design of more robust and reliable models. For instance, in the context of financial forecasting, where data can be highly volatile and non-stationary, relative metrics can offer a more stable and interpretable measure of model performance.

Moreover, these frameworks often incorporate advanced statistical techniques and distance measures, such as Euclidean distance, Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), and Wasserstein distance, to quantify the similarity or dissimilarity between different datasets or model outputs. These measures are crucial for tasks like transfer learning, where the goal is to adapt a model trained on one domain to perform well on another. By providing a unified mathematical foundation, these frameworks facilitate the development of more generalized and adaptable models, thereby enhancing their applicability across a wide range of business and scientific domains.

### 4.3.2 FinTextSim for Financial Text Analysis
FinTextSim represents a significant advancement in the field of financial text analysis, leveraging the power of fine-tuned sentence transformers to enhance the accuracy and relevance of textual data processing in financial contexts [19]. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on hand-crafted features and rule-based systems, FinTextSim utilizes deep learning architectures pre-trained on vast amounts of text data, which are then fine-tuned on domain-specific financial corpora. This approach not only captures the syntactic and semantic nuances of financial language but also adapts to the unique characteristics of financial documents, such as annual reports, earnings call transcripts, and regulatory filings.

The core innovation of FinTextSim lies in its ability to generate high-quality embeddings that effectively capture the meaning and context of financial text [19]. These embeddings serve as robust inputs for various downstream tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and entity recognition. By integrating FinTextSim with existing financial analysis frameworks, researchers and practitioners can achieve more accurate predictions and insights. For instance, in the context of stock price prediction, FinTextSim can help identify key phrases and sentiments from earnings call transcripts that are indicative of future market movements, thereby providing a competitive edge to investors and analysts.

Furthermore, FinTextSim's versatility extends beyond individual document analysis to encompass the broader landscape of financial markets. When applied to large datasets of financial disclosures, such as those found in the MiMIC dataset, FinTextSim can uncover hidden patterns and relationships that are not apparent through conventional methods. This capability is particularly valuable for cross-sectional and time-series analyses, where the goal is to understand the dynamics of market sectors and the impact of macroeconomic factors. By enhancing the quality of financial information extracted from text, FinTextSim facilitates more informed decision-making, ultimately contributing to the efficiency and stability of financial markets [19].

### 4.3.3 Sectoral Performance Ranking and Budget Transcripts
In the realm of financial market analysis, the integration of textual data from budget transcripts has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting sectoral performance [18]. The Indian Union Budgets, spanning from 1947 to 2025, provide a rich dataset comprising over 1,600 texts from budget transcripts, each labeled with corresponding sectors [18]. This dataset, known as BASIR (Budget-Assisted Sectoral Impact Ranking), not only offers a historical perspective on sectoral allocations but also serves as a foundation for empirical assessments of sectoral performance post-budget announcements [18]. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, researchers can extract meaningful insights from these transcripts, identifying key sectors that are likely to outperform following the budget release.

The BASIR framework introduces a novel approach to sectoral performance ranking by combining quantitative financial metrics with qualitative textual analysis. Traditional methods often rely solely on historical financial data, which may not fully capture the forward-looking signals embedded in budget transcripts. The integration of textual data allows for a more comprehensive evaluation, as the language and tone used in these documents can provide early indicators of sectoral growth or decline. For instance, positive sentiment in budget speeches regarding specific sectors can correlate with subsequent market performance, offering investors and analysts a valuable edge in making informed decisions. This approach has been validated through empirical studies, demonstrating that models incorporating textual data from budget transcripts outperform those based on historical financial metrics alone.

Moreover, the application of large language models (LLMs) in this context has further enhanced the predictive capabilities of sectoral performance ranking. LLMs, with their ability to understand and interpret complex textual information, can provide nuanced insights that are not easily discernible through traditional methods. These models can analyze the sentiment, context, and implications of budgetary announcements, thereby improving the accuracy of sectoral performance predictions. The empirical assessment of LLMs in this domain has shown that they can effectively identify sectors with the highest potential for growth, even in the absence of immediate quantitative indicators. This integration of LLMs with financial data analysis represents a significant advancement in the field, offering a more holistic and forward-looking approach to sectoral performance ranking.

# 5 Machine Learning for Bankruptcy Prediction

## 5.1 Advanced Prediction Models

### 5.1.1 Statistical and Machine Learning Techniques
Statistical and machine learning techniques have been pivotal in advancing the field of actuarial learning, particularly in the context of bankruptcy prediction [1]. Traditional statistical methods, such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Multi-discriminant Analysis (MDA), have been widely used for their ability to handle multiple classes and provide insights into the discriminative features of financial distress. These methods, however, often struggle with high-dimensional data and the quantification of uncertainty in predictions, which are critical aspects in financial modeling. To address these limitations, machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), have been increasingly adopted. SVMs excel in high-dimensional spaces and can effectively handle non-linear relationships, making them suitable for complex financial datasets. ANNs, on the other hand, offer a flexible framework for modeling intricate patterns and can be extended to deep learning architectures for enhanced predictive power.

Decision tree-based methods, such as those introduced by Morgan and Sonquist (1963) through the Automatic Interaction Detector (AID), have evolved into sophisticated algorithms like random forests and gradient boosting [20]. These ensemble methods not only improve predictive accuracy but also enhance model interpretability, a crucial factor in actuarial applications where transparency is paramount. Random forests, for instance, aggregate multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting and provide robust predictions, while gradient boosting iteratively refines the model by focusing on difficult-to-predict instances. More recent advancements, such as XGBoost, further optimize computational efficiency and model performance, making them highly effective for large-scale financial datasets. The integration of decision trees with other machine learning techniques, such as ensemble methods and deep learning, has led to the development of hybrid models that combine the strengths of multiple approaches.

In the realm of advanced bankruptcy prediction, deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), have shown promise in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies in financial data [6]. CNNs are particularly useful for identifying local patterns in structured data, such as financial statements, while LSTMs excel in handling sequential data, making them ideal for analyzing time-series financial metrics. MLPs, with their ability to model non-linear relationships, serve as a foundational architecture for more complex deep learning models. The effectiveness of these models, however, is contingent upon the quality and structure of the input data, highlighting the importance of rigorous data preprocessing and feature engineering. By leveraging these advanced techniques, researchers and practitioners can develop more accurate and robust models for predicting financial distress, thereby mitigating the risks associated with corporate bankruptcy [4].

### 5.1.2 Feature Selection and Data Balancing
Feature selection and data balancing are critical steps in the preprocessing phase of machine learning pipelines, particularly in the context of bankruptcy prediction [21]. Feature selection involves identifying the most relevant features that contribute to the predictive power of the model while reducing dimensionality and avoiding overfitting. Techniques such as Random Forest, correlation analysis, and genetic algorithms are commonly employed for this purpose. Random Forest, for instance, not only ranks features based on their importance but also captures non-linear relationships and interactions between variables, making it a robust choice for feature selection in complex datasets. Correlation analysis helps in identifying and eliminating redundant features that may introduce multicollinearity, thereby improving model stability and interpretability. Genetic algorithms, on the other hand, use evolutionary techniques to iteratively select the optimal subset of features, often leading to more efficient and accurate models.

Data balancing addresses the issue of class imbalance, which is prevalent in bankruptcy prediction datasets where the number of non-bankrupt companies typically far outweighs the number of bankrupt companies. This imbalance can lead to biased models that perform well on the majority class but fail to accurately predict the minority class. Techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) are widely used to balance the dataset by generating synthetic samples for the minority class. SMOTE works by creating new instances along the line segments joining any/all of the k-nearest neighbors for each example in the minority class. This approach not only increases the number of minority class samples but also introduces diversity, which can improve the model's ability to generalize. Other techniques, such as Random Over-sampling and Under-sampling, can also be effective but may introduce noise or lose important information, respectively.

In the context of bankruptcy prediction, the combination of feature selection and data balancing is crucial for building robust and reliable models [21]. The feature selection process ensures that the model focuses on the most informative and relevant features, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving computational efficiency. Data balancing, on the other hand, ensures that the model is trained on a representative sample of both classes, thereby improving its predictive accuracy, especially for the minority class. Together, these techniques enhance the overall performance of machine learning models, making them more effective in identifying companies at risk of bankruptcy [1]. The effectiveness of these techniques is further validated through comprehensive experiments and evaluations, where models are tested on holdout sets to ensure that they generalize well to unseen data.

### 5.1.3 Bayesian Framework and Expert Judgment
The Bayesian framework offers a robust and flexible approach to incorporating expert judgment into actuarial learning models, enhancing their reliability and interpretability. This framework allows for the explicit quantification of uncertainty, which is crucial in fields such as finance and healthcare, where decisions based on model predictions can have significant consequences. By integrating prior knowledge and expert opinions into the model, the Bayesian approach not only improves the model's robustness against irrelevant data and outliers but also provides a clear and intuitive interpretation of the results, making it accessible to users with varying levels of statistical expertise.

In the context of bankruptcy prediction, the Bayesian framework can be particularly advantageous [3]. It enables the incorporation of expert judgment regarding the financial health of a company, which can be crucial in identifying early warning signals that may not be evident from the data alone. For instance, expert insights on industry-specific trends, management practices, and market conditions can be encoded into the prior distributions of the model parameters. This integration of expert knowledge helps to refine the model's predictions, making them more accurate and relevant to the specific context of the company or industry being analyzed.

Moreover, the Bayesian framework facilitates the updating of model parameters as new data becomes available, allowing for a dynamic and adaptive approach to bankruptcy prediction [3]. This adaptability is essential in rapidly changing economic environments, where the relevance and accuracy of predictive models can quickly diminish. By continuously updating the model with new information and expert insights, the Bayesian approach ensures that the predictions remain current and reliable, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the bankruptcy prediction process [3].

## 5.2 Data Preprocessing and Imputation

### 5.2.1 Granular Computing for Missing Data
Granular computing offers a robust framework for addressing missing data in high-dimensional datasets, particularly prevalent in bankruptcy prediction studies [21]. By forming granules around missing values, this approach focuses on the most semantically relevant features, thereby reducing the complexity of imputation tasks. The process involves grouping similar data points based on their proximity in feature space, allowing for a more focused and efficient handling of missing information. This method leverages the inherent structure of the data, enabling the prediction of missing values with greater accuracy and less computational overhead compared to traditional imputation techniques.

In the context of bankruptcy prediction, where datasets often contain tens of thousands of observations and numerous missing elements, granular computing provides a scalable solution [21]. The formation of granules around missing values considers only the most significant features, which are typically those that have a strong correlation with the financial health of a company. This selective approach ensures that the imputation process is informed by the most relevant data, leading to more reliable predictions. Moreover, the granular structure facilitates the integration of various machine learning and statistical models, enhancing the overall robustness of the prediction system.

The application of granular computing in missing data imputation is further enhanced by its ability to handle the high dimensionality and large size of bankruptcy datasets [21]. By focusing on a smaller, more relevant subset of data, the method reduces the noise and redundancy often present in big data environments. This not only improves the efficiency of the imputation process but also enhances the interpretability of the results. As a result, granular computing emerges as a promising technique for improving the accuracy and reliability of bankruptcy prediction models, especially in scenarios where data quality and completeness are major concerns.

### 5.2.2 BERT-Based Sentiment Analysis
BERT-Based Sentiment Analysis leverages the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to capture nuanced sentiments from textual data, particularly in the domain of financial disclosures. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis methods that often rely on rule-based systems or simpler machine learning models, BERT's deep contextualization and bidirectional training allow it to understand the context and subtle nuances of language, making it highly effective for analyzing complex documents such as Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections in corporate filings [22]. By pre-training on large corpora and fine-tuning on specific tasks, BERT can accurately capture the sentiment of text, even when the language is ambiguous or contains industry-specific jargon.

In the context of bankruptcy prediction, BERT-based sentiment analysis offers a powerful tool for extracting predictive signals from unstructured financial narratives [22]. The MD&A section of annual reports, for instance, contains forward-looking statements and qualitative assessments of company performance, which can provide early warnings of financial distress. BERT models can be fine-tuned to identify negative sentiment patterns that correlate with future bankruptcy events, such as expressions of uncertainty, financial strain, or operational challenges. This approach complements traditional financial ratio analysis by incorporating textual insights that may not be fully captured by quantitative metrics alone, thus enhancing the overall predictive power of bankruptcy models [4].

Moreover, the adaptability of BERT to different domains and languages makes it a versatile choice for cross-industry and international bankruptcy prediction studies. Researchers can fine-tune BERT models on domain-specific datasets to improve their relevance and accuracy. For example, in the banking sector, BERT can be trained on a corpus of bank-specific disclosures to better understand the unique language and risks associated with financial institutions [22]. Similarly, in the manufacturing sector, BERT can be adapted to recognize industry-specific terminologies and sentiment indicators. This flexibility not only broadens the applicability of BERT-based sentiment analysis but also enhances its robustness across diverse economic conditions and market environments.

### 5.2.3 Taxonomy and Dataset Evaluation
In the realm of dataset evaluation and taxonomy, it is crucial to establish a systematic approach to categorize and assess datasets effectively. The proposed taxonomy aims to provide a structured framework that facilitates the identification and comparison of datasets across different dimensions, such as data type, size, and quality. This taxonomy is particularly important in the context of financial distress prediction, where the reliability and relevance of input data significantly influence model performance. By categorizing datasets into distinct classes, researchers can better understand the strengths and limitations of each dataset, thereby making informed decisions regarding their applicability in specific modeling scenarios.

The evaluation of datasets involves a multifaceted approach that considers various metrics to gauge the informativeness and utility of the data. Key metrics include the completeness of the dataset, the presence of missing values, and the temporal coverage of the data. Additionally, the diversity of data sources and the inclusion of both accounting-based ratios and non-financial indicators, such as corporate restructuring behavior, are critical components of dataset evaluation. These metrics help in assessing the robustness of the dataset and its potential to capture the multifaceted nature of financial distress. Furthermore, the evaluation process should also account for the potential biases and limitations inherent in the data, ensuring that the selected datasets are representative and unbiased.

To enhance the transparency and reproducibility of research findings, it is essential to document the evaluation criteria and the rationale behind the selection of datasets. This documentation not only aids in the replication of studies but also contributes to the cumulative knowledge in the field. By systematically evaluating and categorizing datasets, researchers can identify gaps in existing data resources and highlight areas where new data collection efforts are needed. Moreover, the development of standardized evaluation metrics and taxonomies can foster collaboration and facilitate the sharing of best practices among researchers, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable financial distress prediction models.

## 5.3 Model Evaluation and Robustness

### 5.3.1 Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models
In the realm of machine learning, the comparative analysis of various models is crucial for understanding their strengths and weaknesses in specific applications. This section delves into the evaluation of several prominent machine learning algorithms, including regression trees, random forests, Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, and feedforward neural networks, in the context of predicting one-year-ahead mortality rates [20]. Each model is assessed based on its predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability, which are critical factors in healthcare and financial applications where decisions based on model predictions can have significant implications.

The decision tree, a foundational algorithm, serves as a baseline for more complex ensemble methods such as random forests and Boosting. Random forests, by aggregating multiple decision trees, often achieve higher accuracy and robustness against overfitting, making them suitable for datasets with high variance. Boosting algorithms, particularly those like XGBoost and CatBoost, enhance predictive power by sequentially correcting the errors of weak learners, leading to highly accurate models. However, these models can be computationally intensive and less interpretable compared to simpler models. Feedforward neural networks, while powerful in capturing complex nonlinear relationships, require substantial data and computational resources, and their black-box nature poses challenges for interpretability.

The comparative analysis also highlights the importance of model selection based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand. For instance, in scenarios where interpretability is paramount, such as in medical diagnosis, simpler models like decision trees or logistic regression might be preferred. Conversely, in applications where predictive accuracy is the primary concern, ensemble methods or neural networks may be more appropriate. The results of this comparative analysis provide valuable insights for practitioners and researchers, guiding the selection of machine learning models for specific tasks and datasets.

### 5.3.2 Dual-Encoder Framework for Intra-Risk and Contagion Risk
The dual-encoder framework for intra-risk and contagion risk is designed to capture the nuanced and multifaceted nature of financial distress, particularly in the context of bankruptcy prediction [23]. This framework employs two distinct encoders to model the internal and external risk factors that contribute to an enterprise's financial instability. The intra-risk encoder focuses on the internal attributes of an enterprise, such as financial ratios, operational metrics, and management practices, to derive a comprehensive assessment of the company's intrinsic risk. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep neural networks, the intra-risk encoder can identify subtle patterns and anomalies that may not be apparent through traditional statistical methods.

In contrast, the contagion risk encoder is designed to model the external risk factors that can propagate through an interconnected business ecosystem. This encoder utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs), specifically Hyper-GNNs and Heter-GNNs, to capture the complex relationships and dependencies between different entities within the enterprise knowledge graph (EKG). Hyper-GNNs are particularly adept at handling higher-order interactions, such as those involving multiple parties in a financial transaction, while Heter-GNNs can model the diverse and heterogeneous relationships that exist between different types of entities, such as suppliers, customers, and creditors. By integrating these GNNs, the contagion risk encoder can effectively quantify the risk of financial contagion, which is the likelihood that the financial distress of one entity will spread to others within the network [23].

The dual-encoder framework combines the outputs of the intra-risk and contagion risk encoders to provide a holistic risk assessment. This integrated approach allows for a more accurate and robust prediction of bankruptcy by considering both the internal health of the enterprise and the external economic environment [23]. The framework is particularly useful in dynamic and uncertain economic conditions, such as those experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, where traditional models may fail to capture the rapid changes and complex interactions that influence financial stability. By incorporating both encoders, the framework can adapt to new data and evolving market conditions, making it a powerful tool for risk management and financial decision-making.

### 5.3.3 Performance Metrics and Economic Conditions
Performance metrics in the context of pension fund liability evaluation and bankruptcy prediction must be robust, interpretable, and capable of handling large volumes of data while maintaining accuracy [2]. Key metrics include precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), which collectively provide a comprehensive view of model performance [1]. These metrics are crucial for assessing the reliability of models in predicting future financial states, particularly in volatile economic environments. The robustness of these metrics ensures that they can effectively handle outliers and irrelevant data, thereby enhancing the stability and reliability of the models [20].

Economic conditions significantly influence the performance of these models, as financial health and solvency are closely tied to broader economic trends. During periods of economic instability, such as recessions or pandemics, the predictive power of models can diminish due to increased uncertainty and variability in financial data. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many models that were previously accurate became less reliable as unprecedented economic shocks disrupted historical patterns. Therefore, it is essential to adapt performance metrics to account for these economic fluctuations, possibly by incorporating macroeconomic indicators and stress testing models under different economic scenarios.

Moreover, the integration of macroeconomic data with traditional financial metrics can enhance the predictive accuracy of models, especially in detecting early warning signals of financial distress. This approach not only improves the robustness of the models but also provides a more holistic view of the financial landscape. For example, combining unemployment rates, GDP growth, and inflation with financial ratios can offer deeper insights into the underlying economic conditions that affect a company's financial health. Such an integrated approach is particularly valuable for stakeholders who need to make informed decisions in rapidly changing economic environments.

# 6 Future Directions


The current research on advanced bankruptcy prediction, while extensive, still faces several limitations and gaps. One significant limitation is the reliance on historical financial data, which may not adequately capture the dynamic and evolving nature of financial distress. Traditional datasets often lack real-time and granular data, such as high-frequency trading data, social media sentiment, and economic indicators, which could provide more timely and comprehensive insights. Additionally, the quality and completeness of financial statements can vary significantly across companies and regions, leading to inconsistencies and biases in model training. Another gap is the limited focus on the interpretability and transparency of advanced machine learning models, particularly deep learning architectures, which are often perceived as black boxes. This lack of interpretability can hinder the adoption of these models in practical financial decision-making, where trust and accountability are paramount.

To address these limitations, several directions for future research are proposed. First, there is a need to develop and integrate real-time data sources into bankruptcy prediction models. This includes leveraging high-frequency trading data, social media sentiment, and real-time economic indicators to enhance the timeliness and relevance of predictions. Advanced data collection methods, such as web scraping and API integrations, can be employed to gather these data streams. Additionally, the development of robust data preprocessing techniques, such as data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering, is essential to ensure the quality and consistency of real-time data. Second, research should focus on improving the interpretability and transparency of advanced machine learning models. This can be achieved through the development of explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as model-agnostic methods like LIME and SHAP, and model-specific methods like saliency maps and attention mechanisms. These techniques can provide insights into the decision-making process of complex models, making them more accessible and trustworthy for financial stakeholders. Furthermore, the integration of domain-specific knowledge and expert judgment into model development can enhance the interpretability and practical utility of these models.

Finally, the proposed future work has the potential to significantly impact the field of bankruptcy prediction and financial risk management. By incorporating real-time data sources, researchers and practitioners can develop more dynamic and responsive models that can adapt to changing economic conditions and provide timely warnings of financial distress. This can help investors, creditors, and regulatory bodies make more informed decisions, thereby reducing the economic impact of corporate failures. Additionally, the enhancement of model interpretability and transparency can foster greater trust and adoption of advanced machine learning techniques in financial institutions, leading to more robust and reliable risk management practices. Overall, these advancements can contribute to a more stable and resilient financial ecosystem, benefiting all stakeholders involved.
