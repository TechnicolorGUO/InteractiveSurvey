# Abstract  

Bankruptcy prediction is an important research area that heavily relies on data science. It aims to help investors, managers, and regulators better understand the operational status of corporations and predict potential financial risks in advance. To improve prediction, researchers and practitioners have begun to utilize a variety of different types of data, ranging from traditional financial indicators to unstructured data, to aid in the construction and optimization of bankruptcy forecasting models. Over time, not only instrumentalized data improved, but also instrumentalized methodology for data structuring, cleaning, and analysis. With the aid of advanced analytical techniques that deploy machine learning and deep learning algorithms, bankruptcy assessment became more accurate over time. However, due to the sensitivity of financial data, the scarcity of valid public datasets remains a key bottleneck for the rapid modeling and evaluation of machine learning algorithms for targeted tasks. This study therefore introduces a taxonomy of datasets for bankruptcy research, and summarizes their characteristics. This paper also proposes a set of metrics to measure the quality and the informativeness of public datasets. The taxonomy, coupled with the informativeness measure, thus aims at providing valuable insights to better assist researchers and practitioners in developing potential applications for various aspects of credit assessment and decision making by pointing at appropriate datasets for their studies.

# 1. Introduction  

The prediction of corporate bankruptcy is crucial for the stability of the economic system and the sustainability of business management. In an everchanging and increasingly competitive global business environment, timely identification of potential financial risks enables companies to implement effective strategic and management measures.  

Traditional accounting-based has played a pivotal role in bankruptcy prediction, providing a comprehensive assessment of an enterprise’s operational and financial status. There are many studies on bankruptcy prediction based on accounting-based data, and most of the studies focus on the model itself to explore how to use a better model to improve the prediction based on current data[1, 2, 3, 4].  

However, publicly available accounting-based data is limited due to several reasons. First, the sensitivity of financial data often restricts full disclosure. Second, as only listed companies are obliged to disclose financial reports, it is difficult to obtain relevant data on small and medium-sized enterprises. Last, but not least, the lack of uniformity in financial report formats complicates the collection, cleaning, and structuring of large datasets, increasing the likelihood of noisy and redundant data. In response to these limitations, the research and professional communities are increasingly turning to machine learning and deep learning techniques, referred to in this paper as advanced bankruptcy prediction methods. We consider these methods as instruments to enhance and increase the quality and informativeness of the dataset for a better performance for bankruptcy prediction.  

Some studies have integrated macroeconomic data with accounting-based variables to capture some signals that cannot be detected by traditional indicators, enabling earlier warning of bankruptcy risk and providing more time and space for corporate decision-making[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].Other research has identified new predictors in emerging areas, such as textual data and relational data, bringing new understanding and research directions to both industry and academia [13, 14, 15, 16]. By combining data from various fields—including financial, market, and social aspects—a more comprehensive understanding of the business ecosystem can be achieved, enriching the context for bankruptcy prediction. Given the multifaceted influences on business operations, utilizing multiple datasets helps address this complexity and build more robust predictive models.  

Currently, there have been many reviews on bankruptcy prediction modeling (see [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]), and they summarize the modeling methods applied to bankruptcy prediction from various perspectives, ranging from traditional techniques to deep learning model applications. However, as the authors of this paper argue, the effectiveness of the model is highly dependent on the quality of the input data. The results of the comparison of the model effectiveness may become obsolete due to the quality differences of the input data. This paper therefore aims at providing a taxonomy by categorizing the datasets that can be found and instrumentalized by scientific publications. By offering the metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of various datasets for bankruptcy prediction, we are able to better understand and collect data that can help predict bankruptcy, so that we can understand the signs and trends and take effective measures ahead of time, thus reducing the risk of bankruptcy.  

Compared to other reviews, this paper is dedicated to a comprehensive and in-depth study of multiple datasets applied to corporate bankruptcy prediction, providing a more holistic perspective on the integration of datasets across disciplines. Our contribution has three important pillars, as follows:  

• To the best our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to survey topical research papers and to define the taxonomy of bankruptcy prediction datasets that are instrumentalized for research. • The developed taxonomy provides criteria for classifying and comparing different datasets, allowing researchers to obtain a more focused view of relevant datasets, and to cater their research needs accordingly. • The proposed set of metrics evaluates the quality and the informativeness of the datasets, supporting therefore researchers in collecting the most appropriate datasets for bankruptcy prediction.  

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, in Section 2 we describe the manually collected data for our research and we introduce our taxonomy. Section 3 narrows down our data sample universe to the publicly available datasets, and introduces our measure that we develop to address the informativeness of datasets. Section 4 concludes with a reflection on our findings.  

# 2. Data and first results: Survey and taxonomy  

The first bankruptcy prediction model appeared in 1968 in the seminal work of Altman [5]. He developed the famous Z-Score model to predict bankruptcy based on the following five financial ratios: working capital/total assets, retained earnings/total assets, earnings before interest and taxes/total assets, market value equity/book value of total debt, and sales/total assets. The model was shown to be successful in providing bankruptcy predictions and served as a foundation for subsequent researchers to further refine bankruptcy models. Numerous scholars and researchers have continued to refine and develop various types of bankruptcy prediction model ever since, narrowing down the general focus across different industries and countries [25, 26, 27, 28, 24, 19]. With the emerge of advanced analytical techniques that thrived on machine learning and vast data availability, more diverse set of data variables were applied to predict bankruptcy. Has bankruptcy research become more efficient as a result of data diversity? And what type of data has become available and instrumentalized for bankruptcy research? This latter question underpins the motivation for this paper.  

To arrive at a sound taxonomy, we first assess and collect datasets comprehensively covering the scientific domain of bankruptcy prediction. To ensure an unbiased environment for data collection, we used Google Scholar $^ 1$ . We executed our search using ”bankruptcy prediction” and ”insolvency prediction” as the primary query terms to identify and collect the relevant datasets, motivated by the seminal work of Bellovary et al. [24] that discusses an indepth survey on different methods for bankruptcy prediction. Notably, we excluded the term ”financial distress” to avoid conflating it with bankruptcy, as the former pertains to operational challenges, whereas the latter involves deliberate asset protection decisions by companies[29]. The study [30] also supports this view that the financial ratios used in the financial distress prediction model don’t contribute to bankruptcy prediction.  

We identified relevant papers using Google Scholar based on the following criteria: (1) relevance to bankruptcy or insolvency prediction, (2) detailed dataset descriptions, (3) the adoption of machine learning or deep learning methods for model training, and, and (4) publication within the past decade (2013-2023) or representative datasets before 2013. This ten-year timeframe was selected to focus on recent developments in big data and machine learning and their implications for bankruptcy research.  

In consideration of maximizing the retention of diverse datasets, to further restrict our investigation, we considered only important works as assessed by the (1) number of citations and (2) the quality of publication venue, i.e. published in ranked conferences and journals. To maintain the diversity of the datasets that is selected for bankruptcy research, thus to create a rather robust environment for our assessment, we also included papers that were operating unique, problem-specific datasets yet achieved less citations. Ultimately, we searched for and included all papers that employed machine learning and deep learning techniques for bankruptcy prediction, independent of the type of dataset that were instrumentalized for the analysis. Our survey resulted therefore in a diverse selection of 47 papers in total, including both public and private, i.e. proprietary, datasets that combined both quantitative (i.e. numeric) and qualitative (i.e. text) variables. To assess and to analyze the used data, we further needed to restrict our analysis on research papers that instrumentalized publicly available, i.e. published datasets. We summarize the findings of our survey in the following subsections.  

2.1. Survey of public available datasets used by advanced bankruptcy prediction  

After manually reviewing the papers found, we collected information to describe the characteristics of the instrumentalized datasets for bankruptcy prediction in as much detail as possible. Table B structures the datasets of the collected 47 papers along the following variables: (1) publication year, (2) number of samples that the study uses, (3) bankruptcy rate, (4) number of features that is applied in the model, (5) data type, (6) data source, (7) publicly available? (8) fee applied?. We use the slash symbol $" \rangle { } ~ / " \rangle$ to indicate where information is not specifically retrievable from a particular paper. Even though that many studies claim the datasets that they use were publicly available, some datasets are only conditionally accessible, such as with subscription fee. The authors of this paper note that it may actually cause a barrier for reviewers to revisit a particular study and/or to use a particular dataset. In the followings we introduce and describe the datasets that are instrumentalized in research, and are claimed to be publicly available with free access.  

# 2.1.1. American dataset  

This dataset was published by Lombardo et al.2 [31] in 2022. The authors collected accounting data from 8262 different companies in the period between 1999 and 2018 related to the public companies in the US stock market. A company is labeled ”Bankruptcy” (1) if it filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in the subsequent fiscal year; otherwise, it is labeled ”Alive” (0). The dataset comprises 78,682 firmyear observations without missing or synthetic values, divided into training (1999-2011), validation (2012-2014), and test (2015-2018) sets..  

# 2.1.2. Polish dataset  

This dataset is published in the UCI machine learning repository, which can be accessed and downloaded $^ 3$ [32]. The dataset focuses on the bankruptcy prediction of Polish companies, collected from the Emerging Markets Information Service (EMIS $^ 4$ ) covering bankruptcies from 2000-2012 and active companies from 2007-2013. This dataset doesn’t show the original value of the financial statements but contains 64 financial ratios as model training features calculated from the financial statements. The response variable Y uses 0 to represent the company does not bankrupted and uses 1 to represent the company go bankruptcy. Five classification cases are based on the forecasting period. The nth year means the data contains financial rates from the nth year of the forecasting period and the corresponding class label that indicates bankruptcy status after (5-n) years.  

# 2.1.3. Taiwanese dataset  

This dataset is published in the UCI machine learning repository, and it can also be found in Kaggle $^ { 5 }$ [33]. The dataset, spanning from 1999 to 2009, was collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal. Company bankruptcy is defined according to the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The dataset comprises 6,819 instances and 95 variables, with the response variable being binary: 220 companies are labeled as bankrupt and 6,599 as non-bankrupt, resulting in a bankruptcy rate of approximately $3 . 2 3 \%$ . A notable advantage of this dataset is the absence of missing values and the high quality of the variables, which comprehensively cover important financial ratios. However, a significant limitation is its relatively small size, which may be insufficient for training machine learning or deep learning models effectively.  

# 2.1.4. SMEsD  

This dataset was published by Wei et al. in 2024 on Github $^ 6$ [34]. This dataset specially contains the information of lawsuit, which is very rare public available data. SMEsD covers 3,976 SMEs and affiliated individuals in China, covering the period from 2014 to 2021. This database forms a comprehensive enterprise knowledge graph linking all enterprises and their related individuals by their basic information and lawsuit records from 2000 to 2021. Basic information for each company includes registered capital, paid-in capital, and establishment date. Lawsuit records provide details such as the involved plaintiff, defendant, subjects, court level, outcome, and timestamp. It can be used to split the out of time dataset for testing.  

# 2.1.5. HAT  

This dataset was collected in early October 2020 and published in 2021 [15], also available on Github7. The authors curated a real-world dataset encompassing the board member network and the shareholder network of 13,489 companies in China. Data was sourced from various public platforms. Specifically, they randomly sampled 1,000 companies located in the same city that experienced bankruptcy in 2018. They then expanded the network by capturing information on all shareholders and board members associated with these firms. This process was repeated twice, resulting in the augmentation of the original 1,000-node network to a more extensive network comprising 13,489 nodes.  

2.1.6. Other publicly available datasets with a subscription fee Bureau Van Dijk. Bureau Van Dijk, a Moody’s Analytics company, provides a range of business intelligence and financial datasets that are widely used in various industries for decision-making, risk assessment, and research.

# 2.2. Taxonomy of datasets used for advanced bankruptcy prediction  

It is a well-known fact in data science that the quality of the data determines the upper boundary of the model performance. Still, despite the importance of recognizing and acknowledging quality measures of the used data, as we argue, bankruptcy prediction research using machine learning has been dominated by a strong, model-driven focus. Numerous scholarly papers have been reviewing and addressing the performance of bankruptcy prediction models [22, 23, 17, 21, 20]. Both Alaka et al. [23] and Clement et al. [21] found that no single tool or model consistently outperforms others, suggesting that a hybrid approach may be more effective. The other paper points out that advanced machine learning methods appear to have the greatest promise for future research on firm failure [20]. In contrast to these scientific works, we analyze the various datasets that are instumentalized for bankruptcy prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first study in the data science literature devoted to this subject.  

After manually reviewing the papers we detected a feature-driven pattern of the applied datasets, allowing us to classify the research papers on bankruptcy prediction. We conceptualized and summarized our findings by a taxonomy. Based on the keywords and the title of the surveyed papers, combined with the leading variables of the applied methodology for bankruptcy prediction, we classified the employed datasets into the following five categories: (1) accounting-based, (2) market-based, (3) macroeconomic, (4) relational, and (5) non-financial. Table 1 structures and defines the different categories of our taxonomy. Below we summarize and define these categories in detail. Additionally, Table B in the Appendix summarizes the reviewed papers and describes their important data-driven features for bankruptcy prediction.

# 2.2.1. Accounting-based datasets  

Traditional financial data is one of the most commonly used data sources in bankruptcy forecasting. These data include financial statements such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements, as well as data related to financial metrics such as operating income, net profit, and return on assets. These data sources provide important clues about the financial health of a company and are often used to build bankruptcy prediction models based on ratio analysis and statistical modeling.  

# 2.2.2. Market-based datasets  

The surveyed papers that use market-based data instrumentalize proprietary datasets, provided by Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation, Bloomberg, Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) dataset, Johannesburg Stock Exchange, Korea Stock Exchange KOSPI Index and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The applied methods of these papers, however, provide an indirect signal on the used, market-based indicators for bankruptcy prediction.Some of the recurring features of market-based datasets are stocck price performance, market capitalization, trading volume, market-to-book ratio, credit default swap, volatility of stock returns, liquidity ratios, dividend yield, and market sensitivity.  

# 2.2.3. Macroeconomic factors  

Macroeconomic data sources include data related to the industry and macroeconomic environment, such as industry growth rates, gross domestic product (GDP), interest rates, and inflation rates. These data can help bankruptcy forecasting models to better consider the impact of the external environment on the business, thus improving the accuracy of the forecast.  

# 2.2.4. Relational data  

Enterprises are an important part of society and have a network of relationships in society that encompasses a wide range of relationships, including with other enterprises, government agencies, non-profit organizations, customers, suppliers, employees and communities. These relationships have a significant impact on the success and sustainability of the enterprise, and they also reflect the state of the enterprise. We also find the transactional data is an important part to form relation between companies[36, 37], however, unfortunately there is no publicly available data upon that.  

# 2.2.5. Non-financial data  

We define this category to add all other types of, typically descriptive, data, as in [38]. Based on the surveyed papers, the majority of instrumentalized datasets are private data sources, however, more studies instrumentalize annual reports of publicly listed companies. As the consequence of the further development of different language models, more studies started paying attention to the annexes of such annual reports. The information that is extracted from these annexes can serve as sentiment variables for bankruptcy prediction, as in [39].  

By reviewing the features of the applied methodologies of the papers, we can indirectly refer to the characteristics of non-financial datasets. According to our review, fundamental information about a company, such as registration date, location, legal form, ownership structure, product information, or the service portfolio, is the most frequently used non-financial data for bankruptcy prediction. Furthermore, company governance indicators, such as company’s management ability, business feasibility, technical ability, are as well crucial elements for bankruptcy assessment. As the reviewed papers [40, 41] argue, governance indicators can reflect the business status and signalize future development of a company. There are also some studies that use tax-based variables or legal (i.e. lawsuit-related) data to predict bankruptcy. Due to data sensitivity, such data is typically owned by private entities.  

Applying our taxonomy on the total set of surveyed papers, Figure 1 depicts the distribution of different dataset types. As our findings show, accounting-based data is still the most commonly utilized data source, which accounts for the vast majority of the reviewed papers. From the in total 47 reviewed studies, 40 papers used accounting-based data. What indicates, however, the emerging trend of using mixed datasets for bankruptcy prediction is that 19 papers out of 40 instrumentalized accounting-based data as the only resource. The remaining 21 studies used other types of datasets to supplement the observations to predict bankruptcy. Only two studies relied purely on market-based data for modelling, and five papers combined market-based data with other data types. From this Venn graph, we know that most papers are rely on a single data type to do the research. It’s may because of the difficulty to do the data fusion.  

With the development of graph neural networks, relational data has been gradually applied to bankruptcy prediction models in recent years. Nonfinancial data has become a very broad category, including not only company information on board and management structure and on annual reports, but also on regulatory and compliance data, such as taxation and litigation, as discussed earlier. Our findings indirectly confirm that research methodologies for bankruptcy prediction have been indeed adopting to the available data variables and applied them accordingly. In total we found 24 papers that use either relational (6 papers) or non-financial (18 papers) data. Most frequently, these datasets were applied in combination with accounting data. There are four papers that exclusively use these datasets for bankruptcy prediction.

# 3. Experiment and impact: Data quality and informativeness for bankruptcy prediction  

The presented survey summarizes different datasets that are deployed for advanced bankruptcy prediction, resulting in a taxonomy to structure and to address their main characteristics. As we further argue, this taxonomy enables setting up an experiment to address the performance and modelingrelated challenges of these different datasets. An experimental evaluation of the different bankruptcy models is beyond the scope of this survey. We present in the followings a complementary, yet equally important assessment to address the quality and the informativeness of datasets as the function of their characteristics.  

# 3.1. Metrics for evaluating the quality of datasets  

Although both machine learning and deep learning models are becoming very powerful for bankruptcy prediction, one needs to carefully consider which datasets are indeed applicable for the analysis. Not every datasets are suitable for training and provide the solution to the modeling objective. Gudivada et al. focus on data quality in the context of big data and machine learning, and list the dimensions for data quality assessment[42]. As they argue, if the dataset is small, the model may overfit. If the paper operates with high dimensional dataset, the deep learning model may not be able to perform effective feature extraction. If there is no correlation in the data, the deep learning model may not be able to perform effective feature extraction on the data. If there are outliers in the dataset, the deep learning model may predict them incorrectly.  

These are commonly known analytical rules for all the datasets. However, the datasets used for bankruptcy prediction, as our taxonomy also conceptualizes, has their own characteristics. Real-world bankruptcy datasets often exhibit a significant imbalance between the number of bankrupt and non-bankrupt enterprises, with bankrupt enterprises typically being a minority. This imbalance poses challenges for model training and evaluation. Some studies have used datasets with artificially higher bankruptcy rates[43, 44, 45], which, although not reflective of real-world distributions, do not invalidate the conclusions of these studies. Understanding the quality of the dataset is essential for its proper use. Therefore, we propose a set of metrics to measure the quality of a dataset, ensuring that it is suitable for effective bankruptcy prediction (see Table2).  

# 3.2. Metrics for evaluating the informativeness of datasets  

In the financial industry, regulatory compliance necessitates high interpretability for both features and models. This requirement means that each input feature in a model must have a clear and understandable meaning to explain the prediction outcomes effectively. Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transform original features into new principal components, which are often difficult to interpret, thus reducing the model’s transparency and interpretability. Consequently, most bankruptcy prediction models do not employ dimensionality reduction methods, such as PCA and factor analysis, for feature engineering. However, the performance of models can sometimes degrade due to the presence of too many redundant features. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the informativeness of these features within their context. To address this need, we propose a set of metrics to evaluate the informativeness of features. We also conduct experiments using available datasets to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of these metrics in assessing the quality of features for bankruptcy prediction.  

Our experiment is inspired by existing literature on feature selection. Laborda et al. [46] mention using Chi-Squared test and correlation coefficients to select features for a credit scoring model. Trivedi et al. [47] conclude that the combination of random forest and Chi-squared tests is the best pair for building credit scoring models, over-performing tests such as information-gain or gain-ratio. Jemai et al. [48] mention the univariate feature selection method by calculating feature importance, information value, as well as Chi-squared tests can represent the correlation between features and labels. Ramya and Kumaresan [49] point out that the effects of these, above-mentioned metrics are, in fact, similar. Based on these commonalities and findings, we deploy therefore for our experiment the information value, feature importance and Chi-squared tests to evaluate feature effects on informativeness. We shortly introduce the selected tests in the following subsections.  

# 3.2.1. Information Value  

Information Value (IV) is a statistical measure commonly used in credit scoring and predictive modeling to evaluate the predictive power of a variable. It quantifies the strength of the relationship between an independent variable and the dependent variable by measuring the variable’s ability to differentiate between the categories of the dependent variable.  

IV is calculated as follows:  

$$
I V = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { k } ( P _ { i 0 } - P _ { i 1 } ) \cdot \ln \left( { \frac { P _ { i 0 } } { P _ { i 1 } } } \right)
$$  

where $k$ is the number of categories or bins of the independent variable, $P _ { i 0 }$ is the proportion of non-events (refers to active companies in this context) in the $i$ th category, and $P _ { i 1 }$ is the proportion of events (refers to bankrupted companies in this context) in the $i$ th category.  

A higher IV indicates a stronger predictive power of the variable. Typically, if $I V \geq 0 . 5$ , researchers associate a variable with a very strong predictive power. If $0 . 1 \leq I V < 0 . 3$ , a moderate predictive power is associated to the variable. Consequently, $I V < 0 . 0 2$ indicates no predictive power. In practice, IV is often used during the variable selection process in predictive modeling to identify and retain the most influential variables for model development.  

# 3.2.2. Feature Importance  

Feature Importance (FI) is a crucial concept in machine learning and data analysis, aimed at identifying and quantifying the contribution of individual features or variables in a predictive model. Understanding FI helps practitioners interpret model outputs and prioritize variables based on their impact on the model’s performance.  

One commonly used method to calculate FI is the Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI) for decision tree-based models, such as Random Forests.  

The formula for MDI can be expressed as follows:  

$$
\begin{array} { r c l } { \operatorname { M D I } ( X _ { j } ) = \displaystyle \sum _ { t } p ( t ) \cdot \mathrm { i m p u r i t y } ( t ) } \\ { - \displaystyle \sum _ { t _ { L } } p ( t _ { L } ) \cdot \mathrm { i m p u r i t y } ( t _ { L } ) } \\ { - \displaystyle \sum _ { t _ { R } } p ( t _ { R } ) \cdot \mathrm { i m p u r i t y } ( t _ { R } ) } \end{array}
$$  

where $X _ { j }$ represents the j-th feature; $t$ denotes a node in the tree; $t _ { L }$ and $t _ { R }$ represent the left and right child nodes, respectively; $p ( t )$ , $p ( t _ { L } )$ , and $p ( t _ { R } )$ are the proportions of samples reaching node $t$ , $t _ { L }$ , and $t _ { R }$ among the total samples, respectively; and impurity() measures the impurity of a node, and it depends on the specific impurity criterion used (e.g., Gini impurity, entropy).  

$\mathrm { F l } _ { X _ { j } }$ can be computed by normalizing the MDI values:  

$$
\operatorname { F I } _ { X _ { j } } = { \frac { \operatorname { M D I } ( X _ { j } ) } { \sum _ { j } \operatorname { M D I } ( X _ { j } ) } }
$$  

The higher the FI value for a specific variable is, the more influential that variable is in the model. It is important to note that there are various other methods for calculating feature importance, depending on the model type and the underlying algorithms used.  

# 3.2.3. Chi-squared test  

The chi-squared $( \chi ^ { 2 } )$ test is a statistical method used to determine if there exists a significant association between categorical variables. It is particularly useful for analyzing contingency tables, which display the frequency distribution of two or more categorical variables.  

The chi-squared test applies the following formula:  

$$
\chi ^ { 2 } = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { r } \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { c } \frac { ( O _ { i j } - E _ { i j } ) ^ { 2 } } { E _ { i j } }
$$  

where $\chi ^ { 2 }$ is the chi-square test statistic, $O _ { i j }$ represents the observed frequency in the $i$ -th row and $j$ -th column of the contingency table, $E _ { i j }$ is the expected frequency in the $i$ -th row and $j$ -th column, calculated under the assumption of independence between the variables.  

The chi-squared test helps assess whether the observed frequencies significantly deviate from the expected frequencies, allowing researchers to determine if there is a statistically significant association between the variables. Commonly used, the null hypothesis ( $H _ { 0 }$ ) assumes independence between the variables, while the alternative hypothesis ( $H _ { 1 }$ ) suggests a significant association. If the calculated chi-square test statistic is greater than the critical value from the chi-squared contingency table, or if the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (commonly 0.05), then the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating a significant association between the categorical variables.  

# 3.3. Experimental setup and results  

In order to get realistic results for our metrics evaluation, we divide the analyzed datasets into two separate sub-sets, into a training and a testing set, respectively. The training sets provide the fundamentals to assess the metrics value to describe the quality of data in the context of bankruptcy prediction . We set the ratio of training and testing sets to 70%:30% in our experiment, and applied for each dataset accordingly. During our experiment, we also randomly split each dataset five times, thus repeated the setting of ratios and used eventually the aggregated average of those five repeats as the metrics value.  

The summary of quality metrics for the evaluated datasets is presented in Table 3. It is noted that the Russian dataset exhibits a significantly higher bankruptcy rate compared to others, which may offer modeling advantages but could potentially deviate from real-world scenarios. Moreover, the sample size of the Russian dataset is notably small, presenting challenges for model training. Additionally, the Russian dataset demonstrates a relatively high feature-to-sample size ratio. In contrast, the American dataset as well as the Taiwanese dataset shows an opposite trend with a large sample size but fewer features. This imbalance between sample size and number of features could also pose a challenge when modeling. The five Polish datasets seem more balanced with a reasonable bankruptcy rate. Therefore, it’s important for researchers and professional to know the quality of the dataset before using it.  

Figures 2, 3 and 4 summarize our findings. We compare the metrics value of different datasets using box plots. As Figures 2 and 4 indicate, the features of the American dataset perform the best for both feature importance and the Chi-squared test. However, it ranks relatively low for information value. The apparent difference of metrics rankings, as our experiment concludes, shows an opposite finding compared to what Ramya and Kumaresan[49] conclude.

Figure 2: Feature importance of different datasets  

Features from Russian dataset have a relatively high value for feature importance but not that good for Chi-squared test. In terms of information value, features from Russian dataset speared over a wide range, which means it has features with extreme high information value and at the same time there are features with extreme low information value.  

The performance of five Polish datasets are quite similar in each metric may because they share the same features. The average lines of each box representing for each Polish dataset are basically at the same level for these three datasets. All of them are ranked in the middle.

# 4. Conclusion  

Bankruptcy prediction has important practical applications in the financial field, and the application of diverse data sources enhances more comprehensive and multi-perspective information for constructing prediction models. From traditional financial data to emerging social media and alternative data, as well as incorporating machine learning techniques, all contribute to the accuracy and usefulness of bankruptcy prediction. However, rational integration and mining of these data, along with continuous improvement of predictive models, remain crucial issues to be addressed in future research and practice.  

In this study, we collected different datasets used in this paper from 47 literatures related to bankruptcy prediction, and conducted qualitative and quantitative analysis on them, hoping to bring insight to researchers. Our findings indicate that while different data sources provide more information for bankruptcy forecasting, integrating this data and mining valuable information is challenging. Data quality, data inconsistency, and cross-data source issues are challenges that need to be overcome. When applying bankruptcy prediction models constructed from different data sources, model evaluation and improvement are critical. Backtesting and validation of models using historical data, adoption of appropriate performance metrics to measure the accuracy of predictions, and improvement and optimization of models based on evaluation results.  

At present, accounting-based data remains the predominant dataset for training bankruptcy prediction models. This kind of dataset is relatively easy to obtain and the data quality is high. At the same time, we also find that the new data type of relational dataset also plays a very important role in bankruptcy prediction, but this kind of data usually involves some sensitive data such as transaction information, and the knowledge graph of enterprises and people, which is not easy to obtain.  

Although many datasets are public datasets, most of them are paid for or self-integrated. There are not many datasets that are completely free and can be downloaded directly. We will continue to follow this information in the future.
