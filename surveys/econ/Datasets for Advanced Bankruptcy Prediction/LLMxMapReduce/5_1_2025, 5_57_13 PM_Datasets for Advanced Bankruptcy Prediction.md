# 0. Datasets for Advanced Bankruptcy Prediction  

# 1. Introduction  

The accurate prediction of corporate bankruptcy remains a critical task for financial institutions, investors, and enterprises, particularly in the wake of recent financial crises which have underscored the potential for widespread economic disruption [1,5,9,11]. Effective predictive models are essential for informed decision-making, enabling timely intervention to mitigate losses and manage risks, such as those within complex business groups [9,15]. Traditionally, bankruptcy prediction relied on statistical methods like Altman's Z-score or Ohlson's O-score, as well as structural models such as the Merton model [5,14]. However, these models often face limitations in handling the increasing volume, variety, and complexity of financial data and intricate relationships [1].​  

In response to these challenges, the field has witnessed a significant transition towards advanced data mining and machine learning techniques, including ensemble learning methods like boosting and Support Vector Machines, as well as deep learning [1,2,5,9,11,12]. These advanced approaches demonstrate enhanced capabilities in processing high-dimensional data, capturing non-linear patterns, and potentially improving predictive accuracy compared to traditional models [1,9].​  

The effectiveness and performance of these sophisticated machine learning and deep learning models are fundamentally underpinned by the datasets they are trained and evaluated upon. The availability of diverse, high-quality data sources has increased significantly, moving beyond traditional financial statements to include heterogeneous information, presenting both opportunities and challenges [10]. Adapting existing methods to leverage these multisource heterogeneous features is a key challenge [10]. Moreover, data preprocessing steps, such as feature selection to identify representative data and enhance performance, and instance selection or outlier detection to filter out problematic data, are recognized as crucial for building robust and reliable prediction models [7,11,12]. Studies comparing model performance across different datasets or after data quality adjustments highlight the direct influence of dataset characteristics on prediction outcomes [7].  

While existing literature reviews often cover prediction methodologies, a dedicated and comprehensive analysis focusin pecifically on the datasets used for advanced bankruptcy prediction is less common.

# 2. Overview of Bankruptcy Prediction Models  

![](images/ac2ea87412d6d23e2fad47dd1c28ec8927a72d2d4da7edc6da876ec175bb8ccd.jpg)  

The field of bankruptcy prediction has evolved significantly, transitioning from traditional statistical approaches to sophisticated machine learning and deep learning methods [1]. This progression is driven by the increasing complexity of financial systems and the availability of diverse, high-dimensional datasets.  

Traditionally, bankruptcy prediction relied on statistical models primarily utilizing financial ratios derived from companies' balance sheets and income statements. Prominent examples include univariate models like Beaver's (1966) and multivariate discriminant analysis, notably Altman's Z-Score (1968) [13,14]. Other statistical and market-based models such as Ohlson (1980), Merton DD, Naïve DD, KMV, EWMA, and Monte Carlo simulations have also been employed [8,13,14]. Logistic regression (Logit) is another foundational statistical model often used due to its ability to estimate default probabilities and address limitations of models like the Z-score [5]. While these traditional methods provided initial frameworks, they often rely on assumptions about data distribution and linearity, which may not fully capture the complex, non-linear relationships inherent in financial distress [9].  

The limitations of traditional statistical models paved the way for the adoption of machine learning techniques [10,17]. Machine learning models offer greater flexibility in handling complex patterns and non-linear interactions within financial data. Commonly applied machine learning algorithms in bankruptcy and credit risk prediction include Support Vector Machines (SVM), which are effective for classification, particularly in dealing with non-linear and non-stationary data [5,9,16]. Studies comparing models have shown SVM to exhibit high prediction accuracy and stability [7]. Other frequently used machine learning models encompass artificial neural networks, decision trees, random forests, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) [7,16,17]. Comparative analyses often highlight the varying strengths of different models; for instance, Logit might be preferred for early warning systems focusing on identifying more default events, while SVM might be favored for regulatory actions requiring higher precision [5].​  

Further advancements have led to the exploration of ensemble learning methods and deep learning architectures [1,10]. Ensemble methods, such as Boosting, Stacking, and hybrid combinations, aggregate the predictions of multiple base models to improve overall robustness and accuracy [2,10,11,17]. These approaches aim to mitigate the biases and limitations of individual classifiers [10]. Deep learning models, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), represent a significant leap by enabling automatic feature extraction from raw data and handling high-dimensional inputs effectively [1,8,12]. This is particularly relevant as predictive models increasingly incorporate non-traditional data sources like text or multi-modal information [8].  

The rationale for this evolution towards more complex machine learning and deep learning models is primarily rooted in their potential to capture more intricate patterns, handle larger volumes and varieties of data, and potentially achieve higher predictive performance compared to simpler statistical models. However, this increased complexity comes with a greater reliance on data. Advanced models are data-hungry, and their performance is highly dependent on the quality, relevance, structure, and volume of the training data. The transition from models relying solely on predefined financial ratios to those capable of learning features automatically from vast, heterogeneous datasets [1] underscores the critical importance of understanding the characteristics, strengths, and limitations of the datasets used. Effective application of these advanced models necessitates not only algorithmic expertise but also a deep understanding of the underlying data sources and their suitability for the task, which forms the focus of subsequent discussion.  

# 3. Traditional Datasets and Features  

Traditional bankruptcy prediction has historically relied predominantly on datasets derived from established financial reporting sources, primarily financial statements and credit reports [1,3,13]. These datasets capture a company's financial status and performance over time, often spanning multiple years [14]. Examples of such widely used datasets include the Australian, German, Japanese, and UC Competition datasets, which formed the basis for evaluating model performance and data characteristics like outliers [7]. Financial data from specific markets, such as listed companies in the Chinese A-share market—particularly those designated as “ST” (Special Treatment) indicating financial distress—or data from platforms like Orbis and Experian for Danish firms, exemplify the types of sources utilized [13,14].  

The features within these datasets are typically standard financial metrics and ratios constructed from raw financial statement items like income statements and balance sheets [1,13]. These features are designed to reflect various critical aspects of a company's financial health [1,3]. Key areas assessed include profitability (e.g., Return on Assets – ROA), operational efficiency (e.g., Operating Gross Margin), solvency (e.g., Total Liability/Equity Ratio, current liabilities, monetary assets), operational capabilities, capital structure, and asset structure (e.g., fixed asset disposal, surplus reserve) [1,3,5]. These metrics are considered crucial for evaluating a company's ability to repay debts, maintain profits, and manage its assets and liabilities effectively [1]. Comprehensive traditional datasets can encompass a large number of these financial factors, sometimes exceeding 400, serving as input variables for prediction models [5]. Some datasets also include integerbased continuous and discrete financial metrics [3].​  

Historically, these traditional datasets were analyzed using statistical models to predict financial distress and bankruptcy [1]. Common approaches included financial statement analysis and prediction models such as linear regression and logistic regression [1]. Specific models like the Z-Score and Naïve DD models were also calculated using features derived from financial data [14]. More complex statistical frameworks, such as models relevant to KMV, EWMA, and Monte Carlo simulations, have also been applied to traditional financial data for assessing systemic risk, particularly in the banking sector [8].​  

Despite their foundational role, traditional datasets and methods exhibit inherent limitations. Primarily, they rely predominantly on a single type of information source (financial reports), leading to homogeneous features and potentially incomplete evaluations of the multifaceted nature of financial risks [10]. Such data is often static, reflecting a company's financial position at specific reporting periods, and can be susceptible to manipulation, which can hinder accurate prediction [5]. Furthermore, while focusing on financial metrics, traditional datasets might overlook or treat other internal company characteristics implicitly. However, some data collection efforts alongside traditional financial data have included seemingly non-traditional internal factors, such as employee counts [13]. These factors, while not standard financial ratios, can influence firm-specific risk or the cost of debt [13], suggesting that a broader view of internal characteristics—even if not purely financial—can complement the insights gained from traditional financial statement analysis.​  

# 4. Advanced and Alternative Datasets  

Moving beyond traditional financial statement analysis, the field of bankruptcy prediction is increasingly leveraging a diverse array of advanced and alternative datasets to enhance predictive accuracy and provide earlier warning signals. These data sources capture different facets of a firm's risk profile, ranging from real-time market perceptions and qualitative information embedded in text to complex interdependencies within economic networks and granular details about associated individuals. This section categorizes and analyzes these diverse datasets, highlighting their unique characteristics, sources, and theoretical underpinnings, while also discussing the inherent challenges in their integration [1,2,8,10,13,14].​  

We delve into the features and theoretical links of market-based data to firm value and risk [2,14], explore textual data from corporate reports and external sources, along with necessary feature extraction techniques like sentiment analysis [1,8], and discuss the potential of network data in capturing systemic risk and contagion effects. Additionally, we examine other alternative data types, including niche sources like employee characteristics [13] and alternative financial signals, recognizing the significant challenges associated with integrating these heterogeneous information streams into cohesive and robust predictive models.​  

# 4.1 Market-Based Data  

Beyond traditional accounting figures, market-based data plays a crucial role in advanced bankruptcy prediction models. Unlike accounting data, which provides a historical snapshot of a firm's financial performance, market-based indicators are inherently forward-looking, reflecting investors' collective expectations about a firm's future prospects and risk profile in real time. This distinction is pivotal as it allows models to capture market sentiment and anticipate potential distress signals before they are fully reflected in financial statements.​  

Specific market-based variables commonly employed include stock returns, volatility, dividends, and liquidity measures derived from market activity [2]. Other market-derived inputs, such as stock price and asset volatility, are fundamental components for calculating metrics like the Distance-to-Default (DD) [14]. The theoretical underpinning for using market data in this context is often rooted in structural models of default risk, such as Merton's model [2,14]. Merton's model conceptualizes a firm's equity as a call option on its assets, with the default threshold represented by the face value of its debt. The distance-to-default, a key output of such models, estimates how many standard deviations the firm's asset value is away from the default point, critically relying on market observable data like equity price volatility and market value of equity to infer asset value and volatility [14]. The Naive DD model, for instance, explicitly utilizes market-based information for its calculation [14].  

Empirical studies consistently validate the predictive power of market-based data in distinguishing financially distressed firms from healthy ones. Research indicates that market-based indicators demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional financial ratios for this task [2].  

# 4.2 Textual Data  

Beyond traditional financial indicators, the integration of textual data has emerged as a significant avenue for enhancing the accuracy and timeliness of bankruptcy prediction [1,8]. This approach leverages unstructured text from various sources to capture qualitative factors that may precede quantitative distress signals.  

Key textual data sources explored in the literature include internal corporate documents such as financial reports and audit statements, as well as external information channels like news articles and social media [1,8].  

Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are essential for transforming these unstructured textual sources into valuable features for predictive models. These techniques enable the extraction of insights such as sentiment, topic relevance, and specific narrative patterns. For instance, deep learning models, including BERT and CNN, have been applied to analyze the sentiment embedded within financial disclosures like Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections and audit reports [8]. Such sentiment analysis aims to quantify the tone and outlook conveyed by management or auditors, providing potential indicators of underlying corporate health or risk. Research indicates that incorporating textual data from these financial reports can improve financial distress prediction accuracy [8]. Specifically, the sentiment derived from audit reports has been found to offer more significant incremental predictive power compared to sentiment extracted from MD&A sections [8].​  

Complementing internal reports, external textual data from news articles and social media provides perspectives on corporate reputation, market perception, and industry dynamics [1]. Analysis of these external sources can reveal shifts in public opinion, negative publicity, or market-wide trends that may impact a company's stability. While financial reports offer detailed, official disclosures reflecting management's view and auditor's opinion, external news and social media capture real-time public sentiment and broader market context. The combination and comparative analysis of insights from both internal financial texts and external public discourse, processed through advanced NLP methods, represent a promising direction for developing more sensitive early warning systems for corporate bankruptcy [1,8]. Different textual sources and NLP features capture distinct facets of a company's situation – from internal operational concerns reflected in financial report narratives and sentiment, to external pressures and perceptions mirrored in news and social media – contributing to a more holistic risk assessment.​  

# 4.3 Network Data  

Network data provides a crucial perspective in bankruptcy prediction by capturing the complex interdependencies and vulnerabilities within economic systems, thereby shedding light on systemic risk and contagion effects. While traditional financial data focuses on individual firm characteristics, network data analyzes the relationships between entities, such as firms, banks, or corporate subsidiaries, providing insights into how distress can spread through these connections [15].  

![](images/697f56e1eef7317bb2080c795f78ccfc5db6a14287c971b2974d1e34951a59c1.jpg)  

Inter-firm dependencies, such as credit relationships, supply chain connections, or ownership structures, are critical determinants of a firm's resilience or susceptibility to external shocks or the failure of connected parties. Traditional models often treat firms in isolation, missing the crucial context of their interconnectedness. Network analysis, conversely, models these relationships as a graph where nodes represent firms and edges represent specific types of relationships (e.g., credit exposure, resource flow, ownership ties). The structure and dynamics of this network reveal potential contagion pathways, where the failure of one entity could trigger a cascade of failures among its connected counterparts.  

An example illustrating the relevance of relational data, interpretable through a network lens, is the examination of internal risk management and resource reallocation within corporate groups [15]. While not explicitly employing formal network analysis techniques in the digest description, the study's focus on intra-group relationships, resource flows, and credit risk among subsidiaries inherently examines a network structure. In this context, subsidiaries act as nodes, and intra-group transactions, resource transfers, or credit exposures form the edges [15]. Analyzing how resources are reallocated within the group to manage internal credit risk reveals the strength of connections and potential points of vulnerability or support among member firms. This internal network perspective is vital because distress in one subsidiary can impact others through direct financial ties or shared resources, representing a form of intra-group contagion. Understanding the structure of these internal relationships and the mechanisms of resource movement provides valuable context for predicting the bankruptcy of the group as a whole or individual subsidiaries, highlighting how internal network features augment traditional financial analysis by capturing these hidden dependencies and risk mitigation or amplification processes.  

Common network analysis techniques applicable in this domain, although not detailed in the provided digest, generally involve analyzing network topology (e.g., centrality measures, clustering coefficients) and simulating contagion processes to identify critical nodes or vulnerable structures. The analysis of resource allocation and transaction patterns within a corporate group, as described [15], can be seen as a specific application focusing on the flow dynamics and the resulting redistribution of risk or liquidity within the defined network.  

# 4.4 Other Alternative Data Sources  

Beyond traditional financial metrics, advanced bankruptcy prediction models increasingly incorporate diverse alternative data sources to capture multifaceted aspects of firm health and risk.  

One notable category involves leveraging non‐financial data related to individuals associated with the firm. For example, research has explored the relevance of employee criminal records as an indicator of firm risk and its potential link to the cost of debt [13].​  

A study utilizing the Danish Criminal Registry (Kriminalstatistik Afgørelse), which contains comprehensive data on judicial decisions, penalties, and specific crime codes since 1980—accessed through Statistics Denmark—provides detailed information on employee conduct [13]. This dataset, when combined with employment data from the Integrated Database for Labor Market Research (IDAN database), which includes details on employment spells and salary, allows for linking individual employee histories to firm-level outcomes like the cost of debt [13]. The specific nature of criminal decisions, penalties imposed (including incarceration length), and the year of the decision are granular details available for analysis [13].​  

Another emerging alternative data stream originates from corporate communications. Speech emotion data extracted from earnings calls, for instance, represents a modality capable of conveying information beyond the textual content [8]. Such data can be processed using deep learning techniques; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been employed for feature extraction from this data type, while Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are suitable for sequential prediction tasks based on these features [8].  

The potential of other alternative data sources, such as transactional data reflecting real-time sales activity or web traffic indicating customer engagement and operational status, also exists for capturing dynamic aspects of a firm's operational health. However, the utilization of these highly heterogeneous data types presents significant challenges. Obtaining access to granular, proprietary data like criminal records, detailed employment histories, transactional logs, or web analytics often requires specific agreements and navigating privacy concerns [13]. Furthermore, validating the accuracy and reliability of data from disparate sources—which may lack standardized formats or collection methodologies—is crucial. Integrating these varied data streams, which differ in structure, frequency, and scale, into a unified framework for predictive modeling requires sophisticated data engineering and robust methodological approaches.  

# 4.5 Multi-Modal Data Integration  

The predictive accuracy of bankruptcy models can be significantly enhanced by integrating multiple data modalities, moving beyond traditional single-source financial indicators. This approach leverages the complementary information contained in diverse data types to provide a more comprehensive view of a firm's or individual's financial health and risk profile.​  

Various studies explore the integration of different data sources. Common combinations include traditional financial data with other relevant indicators. For instance, research suggests integrating financial statements with industry-specific and macroeconomic indicators to improve the comprehensiveness of bankruptcy risk assessment [1]. Beyond standard numerical data, the integration extends to less structured modalities. One notable approach involves combining traditional financial ratios with textual data, such as sentiment derived from annual reports and earnings call transcripts, and even speech emotion data extracted from earnings calls [8]. Another study incorporates firm-specific financial data with individual-level data, including demographics, employment history, and criminal records of employees and CEOs, to assess their impact on firm bankruptcy and the cost of debt [13]. Even a simple combination of models leveraging different information sources, such as the joint use of the Naïve DD model and the Z-Score, can be viewed as a form of multi-modal data integration aimed at improving prediction performance [14]. The broader concept of multi-source information fusion is also recognized as a valuable strategy for risk assessment [18].  

The techniques employed for integrating these diverse data modalities vary.  

A straightforward method involves combining features extracted from different sources and feeding the concatenated feature vector into a predictive model, such as an LSTM [8]. More sophisticated approaches address the challenges posed by multisource heterogeneous data. A hybrid-strategy-based self-adaptive method (HSB_RS) has been proposed, which includes a weight-fused adaptive lasso incorporating group weighting (WFAL_GW) specifically designed for adaptively integrating heterogeneous features [10]. Furthermore, HSB_RS incorporates an improved evidential reasoning (ER) rule, AER, for adaptively aggregating the predictions derived from diverse base classifiers, each potentially trained on different data modalities or feature subsets [10]. These fusion techniques aim to effectively combine the signals from different data types, accounting for their potential heterogeneity and varying predictive power.​  

Evidence from the field suggests that integrating multi-modal data can indeed improve bankruptcy prediction accuracy compared to models relying solely on a single data source. By incorporating information from financial statements, market conditions, industry trends, management quality proxies (like criminal records), and forward-looking qualitative data (like sentiment and emotion from earnings calls), models can capture a wider range of risk factors. Although specific comparative performance metrics across diverse multi-modal studies vary depending on the datasets and methodologies used, the exploration of advanced integration techniques, such as those for multisource heterogeneous data [10], underscores the research community's focus on multi-modality as a promising avenue for developing more robust and accurate bankruptcy prediction systems.​  

# 5. Dataset Characteristics and Data Preprocessing  

Effective bankruptcy prediction research fundamentally relies on the quality and characteristics of the datasets utilized, coupled with the rigor of applied data preprocessing techniques. This section details the crucial attributes of bankruptcy datasets, explores their influence on model development and performance, and systematizes the common preprocessing methodologies employed to enhance data quality and model robustness.​  

Bankruptcy datasets exhibit significant variability across several key dimensions, including temporal scope, geographical origin, industry focus, size, and critically, the inherent class imbalance or bankruptcy rate [3,5,8,13,14]. Geographical differences reflect diverse economic, legal, and regulatory environments [15], requiring careful consideration when generalizing models across regions [3]. Similarly, the temporal dimension is critical, as factors influencing bankruptcy evolve over time [1], necessitating the use of appropriate time ranges and potentially time series approaches like rolling prediction [5]. Industry-specific risk profiles and financial structures also impact dataset characteristics, often leading  

researchers to focus on specific sectors like listed companies [3,5,8,14] or SMEs [13], or exclude certain industries [13]. Dataset size impacts the ability to train complex models, while the severe class imbalance, where bankrupt instances are a small minority, poses a major challenge for standard algorithms, necessitating specialized handling [3,7]. These characteristics collectively influence the intrinsic difficulty of a dataset and directly impact achievable model performance [7].​  

Data for these studies is drawn from diverse sources, including public financial databases, company filings, and increasingly, alternative sources like textual and potentially audio data from reports and earnings calls [3,5,8,13,14,15]. While some studies utilize readily available benchmark datasets [7], detailed reporting on original data sources and collection methodologies is often lacking, which can impede reproducibility and understanding of potential biases [5,8,11,14]. Challenges in data acquisition also include access restrictions to proprietary or sensitive data [19] and ensuring consistency across diverse sources or jurisdictions [15].  

Given these dataset characteristics and collection challenges, robust data preprocessing is a vital prerequisite for building effective bankruptcy prediction models. Common preprocessing steps include handling missing values, detecting and treating outliers, standardizing data, encoding categorical features, and feature selection [1]. Different strategies exist for handling missing data, such as imputation using statistical measures like the mean or median, nearest neighbor methods, or interpolation for numerical features [1]. For non-numerical features, imputation with a placeholder like "unknown" may be applied [16].​  

Outlier handling is also crucial, as extreme values can negatively impact model training. Identification methods include statistical checks and visualization tools like box plots [1]. Treatment strategies involve removal, capping values at theoretical limits, or imputation [16]. Distance-based clustering methods offer a more sophisticated approach to outlier detection and removal [7]. Comparing simpler methods like median imputation/capping [16] with distance-based removal strategies [7] highlights a spectrum of techniques, each with potential impacts depending on the dataset characteristics.  

A significant focus in preprocessing is addressing the severe data imbalance [3]. This imbalance can lead to models biased towards the majority class, resulting in poor prediction of the minority (bankrupt) class. Effective techniques for handling imbalance are critical [1,5,16]. These include data-level approaches like oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class, and algorithm-level approaches such as cost-sensitive learning or incorporating regularization during model training [1,5,16]. Regularization techniques, such as adding a penalty term (e.g., $L _ { 1 }$ ​ or $L _ { 2 }$ ) to the loss function, help prevent overfitting, which can be exacerbated by imbalanced data [5]. For instance, a common regularized loss function can be expressed as​  

$$
\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { r e g u l a r i z e d } } ( y , \hat { y } ; \mathbf { w } ) = \mathcal { L } ( y , \hat { y } ) + \lambda R ( \mathbf { w } )
$$  

where $\mathcal { L }$ is the original loss function, $R ( \mathbf { w } )$ is the regularization term based on model weights ​w , and $\lambda$ is the regularization coefficient [5]. The choice and implementation of these preprocessing steps, especially regarding outlier treatment and imbalance handling, significantly influence data quality, model robustness, and ultimately, predictive performance.​  

# 5.1 Key Dataset Characteristics  

The efficacy and generalizability of bankruptcy prediction models are significantly influenced by the characteristics of the datasets used for training and evaluation. Datasets exhibit substantial variations across temporal scope, geographical origin, and industry focus, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities for research [3,5,8,13,14].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Characteristic</td><td>Description</td><td>Example Variations /Impact</td></tr><tr><td>Temporal Scope</td><td>Time period covered by the data</td><td>Factors evolve over time; requires time series analysis</td></tr><tr><td>Geographical Origin</td><td>Country or region of firms</td><td>Different economic/legal environments (Taiwan, China, Denmark)</td></tr><tr><td>Industry Focus</td><td>Specific sector or listed vs. private firms</td><td>Industry-specific risks (Listed companies, SMEs)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Size</td><td>Number of instances (firms/observations)</td><td>Impacts ability to train complex models</td></tr><tr><td>Class Imbalance</td><td>Ratio of non-bankrupt to bankrupt instances</td><td>Severe imbalance (rare event), challenges algorithms</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Geographical variations are prominent, reflecting differences in economic environments, legal frameworks, accounting standards, and bankruptcy regulations [15]. Studies have utilized data from diverse regions, including Taiwan [3], China [5,8,14], Denmark [13], the US [8], Australia, Germany, Japan, and data from the UC Competition [7], as well as cross-country datasets for group-affiliated firms [15]. These differences necessitate caution when generalizing models trained on data from one region to another. For instance, bankruptcy is defined according to Taiwanese business regulations in the Taiwanese dataset [3], a definition that may not directly apply elsewhere. The varying difficulty noted across datasets like the German and UC Competition datasets [7] further underscores the impact of inherent geographical and potentially structural data characteristics on model performance.​  

Temporal dimensions are also critical, as the factors contributing to bankruptcy evolve over time [1]. Datasets cover various periods, such as 2016–2020 [5], 1999–2009 [3], a three-year period up to 2014 [14], or 2003–2015 [13]. The use of time series data is essential to capture the dynamic nature of bankruptcy risk [1], enabling methods like rolling prediction [5]. Changes in economic cycles, industry trends, and regulatory policies across different years within a dataset's timeframe can impact the predictive power of financial ratios and other indicators.  

Industry variations also influence dataset characteristics. Many studies focus on listed companies [3,5,8,14], which have accessible financial data [5]. Other datasets target specific segments like SMEs [13], or exclude certain sectors such as financial, utilities, and state-owned companies [13]. Industry-specific risk factors and financial structures mean that models trained on data from one industry may not perform optimally in another. Datasets comprising industry-specific data [1] are often utilized to account for these differences.  

Dataset size and the bankruptcy rate (class imbalance) are crucial characteristics that can correlate with reported model performance. While specific correlations are not always explicitly detailed in digests, dataset size impacts the amount of information available for model training, potentially affecting the ability to learn complex patterns, especially for rare events like bankruptcy. The Taiwanese Bankruptcy Prediction dataset, for instance, contains 6819 instances [3], while some studies reference datasets without specifying size [11]. Bankruptcy datasets are often highly imbalanced, with a significantly smaller number of distressed firms compared to healthy ones. This imbalance poses a challenge for most standard machine learning algorithms and typically requires specialized techniques for handling [7]. Datasets with more challenging characteristics, potentially related to higher imbalance or inherent noise, like the German dataset, may result in lower reported accuracy compared to datasets perceived as easier, such as the UC Competition dataset, even after data preprocessing [7]. The inherent difficulty of a dataset, influenced by its size, imbalance, temporal, geographical, and industry specificities, directly impacts the performance achievable by prediction models.​  

As a representative example, the Taiwanese Bankruptcy Prediction dataset [3] covers the period from 1999 to 2009 [3], focusing on companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange [3]. It comprises 6819 instances with 95 features [3] and is notable for having no missing values [3]. This dataset exemplifies a common structure used in the field, providing a defined scope (listed companies), a specific timeframe, and a clear definition of the target variable based on local regulations [3]. However, like many real-world datasets, it typically exhibits class imbalance, necessitating appropriate handling during model development.​  

# 5.2 Data Sources and Collection  

Bankruptcy prediction studies draw upon a diverse array of data sources, reflecting the multifaceted nature of corporate financial health and distress. These sources range from widely accessible public databases to highly specific or proprietary datasets, each presenting distinct advantages and limitations. Common data origins include company financial statements, often collected from public filings or specialized financial databases [5,8,15]. Some studies explicitly source financial information from established providers like Orbis and Experian [13], or focus on specific markets such as the Taiwan Economic Journal [3] or the Chinese A-share market [14]. Beyond traditional financial figures, more recent approaches incorporate alternative data sources like annual reports (including MD&A and audit reports) and earnings call transcripts to capture textual and potentially audio-based information [8]. Individual-level prediction, as seen in studies linking criminal records to bankruptcy, necessitates accessing specific personal data repositories such as Statistics Denmark and the Danish Business Authority [13], with bankruptcy data sometimes requiring meticulous hand-collection from sources like Auktioner P/S [13].​  

While some studies utilize readily available "publicly available datasets" like the Australian, German, Japanese, and UC Competition datasets [7], or datasets imported directly from common file formats like CSV [16], they often lack detailed information on the original sources or the specific methodologies employed for their initial collection and compilation [5,7,8,11,14]. This lack of transparency presents a significant challenge in replicating research and understanding potential biases inherent in the data. A key issue in obtaining datasets for bankruptcy prediction [19] is related to data access and sharing restrictions, particularly concerning proprietary financial databases, regulatory filings that may have varying levels of public access, or sensitive individual data. Furthermore, challenges arise in ensuring data consistency, especially when integrating information from diverse sources or across different jurisdictions with varying accounting standards and reporting requirements [15].​  

The methods employed for data collection significantly influence dataset quality and representativeness. Collection can range from manual extraction from reports and filings to automated approaches utilizing web scraping techniques and APIs to gather data from public databases, financial reports, and credit rating agencies [1]. Manual collection, while potentially allowing for careful curation and validation of specific data points (e.g., hand-collecting bankruptcy records [13]), can be time-consuming and limit the scale of the dataset. Automated methods enable the rapid acquisition of large volumes of data, crucial for training complex machine learning models [1], but necessitate robust data cleaning and validation processes to mitigate errors and ensure accuracy. The representativeness of a dataset depends heavily on the sampling strategy and the completeness of the collected information across various firm sizes, industries, and economic conditions. Studies that do not clearly specify their data sources or collection methods make it difficult for subsequent research to evaluate the potential limitations of the dataset in terms of bias, coverage, and overall reliability, highlighting the importance of detailed reporting on the data acquisition process.

Effective data preprocessing is a critical initial step in developing robust bankruptcy prediction models, significantly impacting the quality and reliability of input data for machine learning algorithms. Essential techniques commonly employed include handling missing values, detecting and treating outliers, standardizing or normalizing data, encoding categorical features, and selecting relevant features [1].  

Addressing missing data is a fundamental requirement. Various imputation strategies exist, such as using the mean or median of the available data for numerical features, employing nearest neighbor approaches, or utilizing interpolation [1]. For non-numerical features, imputation with a placeholder like “unknown” is also practiced [16]. The choice of imputation method can depend on the data distribution and the extent of missingness.​  

Outlier handling is another crucial aspect. Outliers, which are observations deviating significantly from other data points, can distort model training and lead to suboptimal performance. Methods for identifying outliers include statistical approaches such as analyzing standard deviations and visualizing data distributions using box plots [1]. Once identified, outliers can be handled by removal—although caution is needed to avoid discarding valuable information [13]. Alternative strategies involve capping extreme values at a theoretical maximum or imputing them with less sensitive values like the mean [16]. A more sophisticated approach involves using distance-based clustering methods to identify and subsequently remove outliers [7]. Studies have explored the impact of removing different volumes of outliers, suggesting that the optimal strategy may be data-dependent and require evaluation [7]. Comparing the median/capping approach [16] with distancebased removal [7] highlights a spectrum from simpler, rule-based methods to more data-driven techniques for outlier mitigation.​  

Data standardization or normalization is often applied to bring features to a similar scale, which is particularly important for distance-based algorithms or optimization procedures. Techniques like min-max scaling and z-score normalization are standard practices [1,3]. Categorical features typically require encoding into numerical formats using methods such as onehot encoding or label encoding [1]. Furthermore, feature selection techniques—including correlation and variance analysis— can reduce dimensionality and focus models on the most predictive variables [1].  

A significant challenge in bankruptcy prediction is the severe data imbalance, where the number of non-bankrupt instances vastly outweighs bankrupt instances [3]. This imbalance can lead models to be biased towards the majority class, achieving high overall accuracy but performing poorly in predicting the rare, critical event of bankruptcy. Mitigating this requires specific strategies. While some studies list standard preprocessing techniques which form the foundation of data preparation [1,16], these digests do not explicitly detail imbalance-specific data sampling or cost-sensitive learning strategies employed within those works. However, datasets known to have this issue explicitly note the necessity of techniques like oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or employing cost-sensitive learning approaches during model training to address this imbalance directly [3].  

Another strategy that can indirectly help in imbalanced or complex datasets is the use of regularization during model training. Regularization terms are added to the loss function to penalize complexity and prevent overfitting, which can be exacerbated by data characteristics like imbalance [5]. For instance, the inclusion of a regularization term   
\​   
in the loss function   
\​   
where \(\lambda\) is the regularization coefficient, can improve classification accuracy by preventing the model from relyin too heavily on any single feature or becoming overly complex [5].  

In summary, the choice and application of specific data preprocessing techniques—ranging from the fundamental handling of missing values and outliers to strategies for severe class imbalance—have a profound impact on the performance and reliability of bankruptcy prediction models. Different methods for imputation and outlier handling offer varying trade-offs between complexity and effectiveness [7,16]. Critically, effectively addressing data imbalance requires tailored techniques, whether through data resampling, cost-sensitive learning, or model regularization [1,5,16], highlighting the need for careful consideration of these steps in the model development pipeline.  

# 6. Feature Engineering and Selection  

Feature engineering and selection represent critical preparatory stages in the development of advanced bankruptcy prediction models, aiming to transform raw data into meaningful inputs and identify the most predictive variables. Feature engineering involves the creation of potentially more informative variables from existing data sources, a practice deeply rooted in the analysis of corporate financial health. Financial ratios derived from standard financial statements serve as foundational features, capturing aspects such as profitability, liquidity, solvency, and efficiency [3,5,15]. These are often categorized systematically for analysis [3], with specific examples including "ROA(C) before interest and depreciation before interest" and "Total Liability/Equity Ratio" [3]. Beyond standard ratios, engineering techniques may involve observing trends in key metrics like operating income and net profit [1], defining specific constructs like the cost of debt [13], or creating composite distress indicators such as the Naive DD model and the Z-Score [14]. Furthermore, feature engineering is extending to incorporate non-traditional data, including criminal records of executives or employees [13] and sentiment derived from textual or speech data [8], often combined with traditional financial indicators. For corporate groups, engineered features might specifically address intra-group financial dynamics and resource allocation [15].​  

Following feature engineering, feature selection is employed to reduce dimensionality, mitigate overfitting, enhance model performance, and improve interpretability by identifying and retaining only the most relevant features [1,4,11]. The literature employs a variety of systematized techniques falling under categories such as filter, wrapper, and embedded methods, as well as dimensionality reduction [12]. Specific filter methods include the t-test, correlation matrices [1,12], SelectKBest with chi-squared test [16], variance contribution analysis [1], and Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR) [4]. Stepwise regression represents a wrapper or embedded approach [12]. Dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA) are also utilized [12]. More advanced methods encompass optimization-based techniques such as Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) [4], Genetic Algorithms [17], and the boosted binary Harris hawks optimizer [18].​  

Empirical evidence generally supports the notion that feature selection is beneficial for model performance [1,4,11]. Studies demonstrate performance improvements, including enhanced accuracy, when utilizing selected feature subsets [4]. The choice of feature selection method can significantly impact the final feature set and subsequent model outcomes, often tailored to complement specific model architectures, such as GWO with Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) or MRMR with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) [4]. Combining features from diverse sources, such as financial ratios and sentiment scores, has also shown enhanced prediction capabilities [8]. However, the consistency of important feature sets across different datasets or methodologies is not extensively detailed in the provided literature, nor is a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity trade-offs associated with various selection techniques.​  

Further advancing the field, research explores integrating feature selection mechanisms directly into model training processes. This includes using optimization algorithms like GWO to guide feature selection concurrently with model training [4], and incorporating feature selection directly within ensemble methods, as demonstrated by the FS-Boosting algorithm [11]. Such integrated strategies, along with frameworks for adaptively handling heterogeneous multisource features [10], represent sophisticated approaches to leverage the benefits of feature selection dynamically within the model building process, potentially leading to more robust and accurate bankruptcy prediction systems.​  

# 6.1 Financial Ratios and Feature Engineering  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Aspect Assessed</td><td>Common Financial Ratios (Examples)</td><td>Feature Engineering Techniques (Examples)</td></tr><tr><td>Profitability</td><td>ROA, Operating Gross Margin</td><td>Trends in Operating Income / Net Profit</td></tr><tr><td>Solvency</td><td>Total Liability/Equity Ratio, Current Liabilities</td><td>Cost of Debt Calculation</td></tr><tr><td>Operational Efficiency</td><td>Inventory Turnover, Accounts Receivable Turnover</td><td>Composite Distress Indicators (e.g., Naive DD, Z- Score)</td></tr><tr><td>Capital Structure</td><td>Debt-to-Equity Ratio,Long- term Debt/Assets</td><td>Intra-group Financial Dynamics (for corporate groups)</td></tr><tr><td>Asset Structure</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Fixed Asset Disposal, Surplus Reserve</td><td>Incorporating Non-Financial Data (e.g., criminal records)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Financial ratios serve as foundational features in the domain of bankruptcy prediction, encapsulating various aspects of a company's financial health and performance [3,5,15]. These ratios are typically derived from financial statements and can be systematically categorized to facilitate analysis [3]. A common approach involves grouping ratios based on the financial dimension they assess, such as profitability, liquidity, solvency, and efficiency [3]. For instance, the [3] dataset includes a variety of ratios falling into these categories, with specific examples like "ROA(C) before interest and depreciation before interest" (profitability), "Operating Gross Margin" (profitability), and "Total Liability/Equity Ratio" (solvency) [3]. Other studies similarly employ ratios related to solvency, such as those involving current liabilities and monetary assets, and asset structure, such as fixed asset disposal and surplus reserve [5]. Profitability and solvency ratios are also highlighted as crucial indicators, particularly in the context of analyzing subsidiary health within a group structure [15].​  

Beyond the direct application of standard ratios, feature engineering techniques are employed to derive more predictive variables or indicators from financial data [13,14]. These techniques often involve transformations, combinations, or more complex modeling approaches. For example, specific financial indicators like operating income and net profit are recognized for their significant impact on bankruptcy prediction, especially when exhibiting concerning trends such as consecutive quarterly declines [1]. This suggests that observing patterns or changes in standard metrics over time can be a form of effective feature engineering. Furthermore, studies define specific, engineered variables to capture nuances not directly represented by standard ratios. The cost of debt (CoD) is calculated as financial expenses scaled by the average interest-bearing debt over two periods, where interest-bearing debt itself is specifically defined as total liabilities net of trade payables [13]. This detailed calculation exemplifies how specific financial constructs can be operationalized into quantitative features. Another approach involves incorporating elements of market valuation and financial structure into a single distress indicator, as seen with the Naive DD model [14]. In the context of corporate groups, feature engineering could involve creating ratios specifically designed to capture the extent of intra-group financial support and resource reallocation, which are vital for assessing the interconnected risk within the group [15]. While some studies imply the use of financial ratios, sometimes alongside other data modalities like sentiment analysis, the explicit details on specific ratios or engineering methods are not always provided [8]. Nevertheless, the process of carefully selecting, categorizing, and engineering financial features remains a critical step in building accurate bankruptcy prediction models, moving beyond simple ratio analysis to capture more complex relationships and signals within financial data.  

# 6.2 Feature Selection Methods  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Category</td><td>Description</td><td>Example Methods</td></tr><tr><td>Filter Methods</td><td>Evaluate features based on inherent properties</td><td>t-test, Correlation, SelectKBest, Variance, MRMR</td></tr><tr><td>Wrapper Methods</td><td>Use a specific model to evaluate feature subsets</td><td>Stepwise Regression (often also embedded)</td></tr><tr><td>Embedded Methods</td><td>Feature selection integrated into model training</td><td>Lasso Regression (L1 penalty), Decision Tree feature importance</td></tr><tr><td>Dimensionality Reduction</td><td>Transform feature space to lower dimension</td><td>PCA, Factor Analysis</td></tr><tr><td>Optimization-Based</td><td>Use optimization algorithms for selection</td><td>GWO, Genetic Algorithms, Boosted Binary Harris Hawks</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Effective feature selection is a critical step in developing accurate bankruptcy prediction models. It aims to reduce dimensionality, mitigate overfitting, and improve model interpretability. Various techniques have been employed and compared in the literature [1,4,12,16].  

A study specifically comparing feature selection techniques in bankruptcy prediction [12] examined methods such as the ttest, correlation matrix, stepwise regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Factor Analysis (FA). These methods represent different categories: filter methods (t-test, correlation matrix), a wrapper/embedded method (stepwise regression), and dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, FA). Filter methods evaluate features based on their inherent properties or their relationship with the target variable independently of the chosen model. Wrapper methods utilize a specific prediction model to evaluate subsets of features, while dimensionality reduction transforms the original feature space into a lower-dimensional one.​  

Beyond these comparative analyses, other specific feature selection methods have been applied. SelectKBest, particularly with the chi-squared test, has been used to select relevant features [16]. Correlation analysis is suggested as a method to identify and remove highly correlated features [1], and variance contribution analysis can assess the impact of individual features [1]. More advanced approaches include optimization-based methods like the boosted binary Harris hawks optimizer [18] and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) [4]. For instance, GWO has been applied to optimize the feature subset specifically for Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) [4]. Another filter method, Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR), has been used for feature selection—most notably in combination with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in contexts such as medical diagnosis [4]—demonstrating its applicability with certain model types. In addition, the integration of feature selection directly into the model training process is explored, as seen in FS-Boosting [11], where feature selection enhances the boosting algorithm itself.​  

The choice of a feature selection method can significantly influence model performance and is often dependent on the type of prediction model used. For example, GWO has been applied with KELM [4], and MRMR has been used for ELM [4] to complement the characteristics of non-linear or ensemble models. Although computational complexity is an important consideration—especially with large datasets—the provided studies do not detail specific computational performance comparisons or the complexities associated with these techniques in the context of bankruptcy prediction. A comprehensive assessment would ideally consider the trade-offs between theoretical principles, empirical performance, computational cost, and the suitability for the chosen predictive model.​  

# 6.3 Feature Selection and Model Performance  

Empirical evidence strongly suggests that feature selection significantly enhances the performance of machine learning models in various predictive tasks, including those related to financial distress and credit risk [1,4,11]. Studies in related diagnostic fields, for instance, have demonstrated improved accuracy when utilizing features selected by methods such as GWO-optimized KELM or MRMR with ELM [4]. Similarly, within the financial prediction domain, it has been observed that combining diverse data sources—such as integrating textual sentiment with traditional financial indicators—leads to enhanced prediction capabilities [8]. Furthermore, the joint application of different predictive models or indicators, like the Naïve DD model and the Z-Score, has been shown to improve overall performance compared to using them individually [14]. Comparative studies indicate that certain techniques, such as the t-test feature selection method, can outperform others in terms of resulting model performance metrics [12]. The process involves selecting features that are subsequently used for training and testing prediction models [16].​  

While the consensus from the provided digests is that feature selection is beneficial for performance by focusing on more relevant features [11], there is limited explicit discussion regarding the consistency of important feature sets across different datasets or methodologies. One study notes that a Logit model selected 14 factors, though the specific features are not enumerated, and comparison details for other models like SVM are unavailable [5]. Certain widely recognized indicators, such as the Z-Score and the Naïve DD model, are highlighted as significant predictors [14], suggesting that composite financial metrics derived from underlying features are often deemed important. However, the digests do not provide sufficient detail to ascertain whether consistent sets of granular features are universally selected across diverse bankruptcy prediction studies utilizing different datasets or feature selection algorithms.​  

The inherent benefits of feature selection, such as mitigating issues like overfitting and the curse of dimensionality, are implicitly supported by the reported improvements in prediction accuracy and the emphasis on selecting more relevant features [1,11]. By reducing the number of input variables and focusing on those most pertinent to the prediction task, feature selection helps models generalize better to unseen data and handle high-dimensional spaces more effectively, although these specific theoretical advantages are not explicitly elaborated upon in the provided digests. Similarly, the role of feature selection in improving model interpretability by simplifying the model input space is not discussed within the scope of the analyzed materials.  

# 6.4 Integrating Feature Selection with Models  

Advanced strategies in bankruptcy prediction often explore the direct integration of feature selection mechanisms with model training processes to enhance performance and robustness.  

One prominent approach involves leveraging optimization algorithms to guide feature selection concurrently with model parameter learning. For instance, the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm has been employed to evolve the Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) model, effectively integrating feature selection directly into the KELM training procedure [4]. This method allows the feature subset to be optimized specifically for the chosen model architecture.​  

Beyond general optimization frameworks, significant efforts have focused on integrating feature selection with ensemble methods, particularly boosting. A notable example is the FS-Boosting method, which directly integrates feature selection within the boosting algorithm itself [11]. This constitutes the central contribution of the FS-Boosting paper, demonstrating a method where feature relevance and selection are dynamically considered during the iterative boosting process. Such integration aims to select features that are most informative at each stage of building the ensemble, potentially leading to more compact and accurate models.  

Other integrated approaches extend to incorporating features derived from diverse data modalities directly into predictive models. Deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have been utilized to extract features from non-traditional data sources such as textual and speech information, integrating these learned representations directly into the prediction framework. Furthermore, methods like HSB_RS demonstrate adaptive integration at a broader level, combining heterogeneous multisource features and adaptively aggregating the predictions of multiple base classifiers through specialized algorithms (WFAL_GW and AER) [10]. While not solely focused on embedding feature selection into a single model's training, this approach exemplifies a complex integration strategy that leverages diverse features and ensemble learning for robust risk prediction.​  

Integrating feature selection directly or adaptively within model training leverages the strengths of both components. It allows the model to be trained on features specifically chosen for its structure or for the current state of the ensemble (as in boosting), potentially leading to superior predictive performance by focusing on the most relevant information and enhanced robustness by reducing reliance on irrelevant or redundant features. These integrated strategies represent a move towards more sophisticated, data-driven approaches to feature management in complex prediction tasks.  

# 7. Impact of Datasets on Model Performance and Evaluation  

The empirical analysis of bankruptcy prediction models underscores the critical interplay between the chosen dataset, the predictive model, and the evaluation methodology. Studies consistently demonstrate that both the inherent characteristics of the data and the specific metrics used to assess performance significantly influence the observed results and the understanding of model capabilities [2,4,5,16].​  

Comparisons across diverse modeling approaches highlight their varying strengths and weaknesses. Research has evaluated classical statistical models like Logistic Regression, traditional machine learning methods such as SVM, Decision Trees, and Artificial Neural Networks, as well as deep learning architectures like LSTM and CNN [1,5,7]. These comparisons often reveal performance trade-offs; for instance, Logistic Regression may exhibit a higher Type I error rate compared to SVM, which might have a higher Type II error rate [5]. This distinction is crucial in the context of bankruptcy prediction, where balancing the costs of false positives (Type I error) and false negatives (Type II error) is paramount [2,5]. Furthermore, specialized models like Naïve DD or boosting methods such as FS-Boosting have been proposed and evaluated against benchmarks, demonstrating potential improvements [11,14].​  

The selection and interpretation of evaluation metrics are fundamental, particularly given the typically severe class imbalance in bankruptcy datasets, where bankrupt instances are rare compared to non-bankrupt ones. While accuracy remains a frequently reported metric [1,4,7,14,16], it can be misleading in imbalanced scenarios. More informative metrics for such contexts include recall (sensitivity), specificity, F1 score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) [1,2,5,13,16]. Studies employing these metrics provide a more nuanced view of model performance, demonstrating superior capabilities over benchmarks or highlighting differences between models in capturing the minority (bankrupt) class [1,2,13]. For example, specific deep learning models have reported performance using recall and F1 scores, indicating their effectiveness beyond simple accuracy [1].  

Beyond model choice and metrics, the intrinsic characteristics of the datasets themselves profoundly impact prediction outcomes. The origin and underlying structure of a dataset, such as differences between a German dataset and the UC Competition dataset, can present varying levels of prediction difficulty, even after standard preprocessing [7]. Marketspecific characteristics embedded in data, such as those from the Chinese A-share market, can introduce correlations contrary to theoretical expectations, affecting model relationships and generalizability [14]. Furthermore, dataset quality, such as the presence of outliers, has been shown to significantly influence model performance, suggesting that data preprocessing steps are critical [7]. The scope and composition of a dataset—including its temporal coverage, geographical region, and the specific feature set included—limit the applicability and generalizability of models trained on that data [5]. The inclusion of richer or alternative feature sets, such as textual sentiment or criminal records, has been shown to improve prediction accuracy [8,13]. While studies often acknowledge the influence of dataset characteristics, a systematic quantification of how specific properties like size, imbalance ratio, or temporal shifts directly correlate with performance metrics is not uniformly presented, posing a challenge for understanding the generalizability and robustness of models across diverse data environments. This highlights a critical area for future research: conducting extensive comparative studies using diverse datasets and consistently reporting a comprehensive suite of imbalance-appropriate evaluation metrics to better understand and predict model performance variability.

Empirical evaluation of diverse modeling approaches is fundamental to advancing the field of bankruptcy prediction. Studies compare various statistical and machine learning models to ascertain their predictive capabilities across different datasets and time horizons. For instance, research has investigated classic machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks, decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines (SVM) [7]. A comparison across several machine learning models utilizing accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report has been presented in the context of automobile loan default risk prediction [16].  

More granular comparisons reveal distinctions between model types. A comparative analysis indicates that the Logit model exhibits a higher Type I error rate (predicting default when it does not occur) but a very low Type II error rate (failing to  

predict a default), whereas the SVM model demonstrates a very low Type I error rate alongside a higher Type II error rate [5]. This highlights the inherent trade-offs between minimizing false positives and false negatives, a critical consideration in imbalanced classification problems characteristic of bankruptcy prediction.​  

The suitability and interpretation of evaluation metrics are paramount, particularly when dealing with datasets where the number of bankrupt instances is significantly lower than non-bankrupt instances. Metrics like accuracy, while commonly used [1,7,14,16], can be misleading in highly imbalanced scenarios. More informative metrics for such contexts include recall (sensitivity), specificity, F1 score, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Several studies report performance using these more appropriate metrics [1,2,13]. For example, one study emphasizes superior predictive power over benchmark models as reflected by recall, specificity, F1 scores, and AUC across different prediction horizons [2]. Another study specifically used AUC as a measure of out-of-sample prediction accuracy [13].​  

Deep learning models have also been evaluated using these relevant metrics. For instance, a study comparing LSTM and CNN models reported specific performance figures: the LSTM model achieved an accuracy of $8 5 . 6 \%$ , recall of $7 8 . 9 \%$ , and F1 score of $8 3 . 2 \%$ in a technology company case, while the CNN model yielded an accuracy of $8 3 . 1 \%$ , recall of $7 5 . 4 \%$ , and F1 score of $8 0 . 3 \%$ in a manufacturing company case [1]. These results underscore the importance of recall and F1 score in assessing performance, as high accuracy alone might merely reflect the majority class.  

Other specialized methods and models have also been proposed and evaluated. The Naive DD model has been compared against the traditional Z-Score model for predicting financial distress, showing the ability to significantly identify distressed companies [14]. Boosting methods, such as FS-Boosting, have been presented as alternative approaches for corporate bankruptcy prediction [11]. Some research also highlights the impact of feature selection methods on model performance, comparing approaches based on unspecified metrics [12]. While some studies claim their proposed models outperform state-of-the-art methods, the specific evaluation metrics for these comparisons are not always detailed [8].​  

Based on empirical results, different model types exhibit varying strengths and weaknesses. Traditional models like Logistic Regression provide interpretability but might struggle with complex non-linear relationships and exhibit unfavorable error profiles (e.g., high Type I error) in imbalanced settings [5]. Classic machine learning models like SVM and Decision Trees offer more flexibility but also present trade-offs in error types [5]. Deep learning models like LSTM and CNN demonstrate competitive performance measured by metrics like recall and F1 score [1], suggesting their potential for capturing complex patterns, though their performance might vary across industries [1]. The choice of model should thus be guided by the specific requirements of minimizing either Type I or Type II errors, alongside overall predictive power assessed through metrics appropriate for imbalanced classification.​  

# 7.2 Influence of Dataset Characteristics  

The inherent characteristics of the datasets employed in bankruptcy prediction studies demonstrably influence model performance and generalization capabilities.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Characteristic</td><td>Influence on Model Performance/Generalization</td><td>Example Impact Noted in Text</td></tr><tr><td>Geographical Origin</td><td>Models may not generalize well across regions due to different env.</td><td>German vs UC Competition datasets showed different difficulty</td></tr><tr><td>Temporal Coverage</td><td>Factors evolve over time, models specific to period may fail</td><td>Findings specific to selected data period (e.g.,2016-2020)</td></tr><tr><td>Market Specifics</td><td>Can introduce unexpected correlations contrary to theory</td><td>Chinese A-share market correlations affected model relationships</td></tr><tr><td>Quality (Outliers)</td><td>Presence of outliers can significantly degrade performance</td><td>Outlier removal improved performance on benchmark datasets</td></tr><tr><td>Scope & Composition</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Limits applicability/generalizability to different firms/features</td><td>Models trained on specific firms/features limited in scope</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Research indicates that the specific properties of a dataset can significantly impact the predictive challenge it presents to machine learning models. For instance, a comparative analysis revealed that different datasets, such as a German dataset and the UC Competition dataset, exhibited varying levels of difficulty for prediction models, even after applying preprocessing steps like outlier removal [7]. This finding suggests that intrinsic data structures or underlying complexities specific to each dataset contribute uniquely to the prediction task’s complexity [7].  

Furthermore, the unique attributes of the market or environment from which the data is sourced can influence model behavior in unexpected ways. Studies using data from specific markets, such as the Chinese A-share market, have observed correlations between variables that run counter to established theoretical expectations, indicating that market‐specific characteristics embedded within the dataset can alter model relationships [14]. This highlights a challenge for model generalization, as relationships learned from one market’s data may not directly translate to others due to these underlying characteristic differences [14].  

The scope and composition of a dataset also impose limitations on the applicability and generalizability of developed models. For example, a study utilizing data from a specific timeframe (2016–2020) and a limited number of financial factors (400) for Chinese listed companies noted that the resulting model coefficients and findings were specifically applicable only to the selected data period and company profile [5]. This underscores that the temporal coverage, geographical region, and the specific set of features included in a dataset can restrict the domain of applicability for models trained on that data, posing significant challenges for deploying these models across different periods, regions, or datasets with richer or different feature sets [5]. While analyses exploring direct correlations between dataset features like sample size, bankruptcy rate, or time period coverage and prediction accuracy are not uniformly detailed across all studies, the documented impacts of dataset origin, complexity, and scope collectively demonstrate their critical influence on bankruptcy prediction outcomes and the subsequent challenges in achieving robust model generalization.​  

# 8. Case Studies and Applications  

The practical application of advanced models for bankruptcy prediction is effectively illustrated through various case studies employing real-world datasets. These studies demonstrate the utility of sophisticated techniques in diverse financial contexts, highlighting both achievements and challenges in deployment [1,14,17].​  

Several case studies focus on predicting financial distress among listed companies in China, spanning sectors such as services and manufacturing [17]. These analyses often incorporate factors beyond traditional financial ratios, including corporate governance structures and measures of default distance [17]. For instance, one study applied the Naive DD model to Chinese listed firms to predict financial distress, providing a specific regional case study [14]. Further detailed examples include the application of deep learning models: an LSTM model was utilized for a technology company, achieving an accuracy of $8 5 . 6 \%$ , a recall of $7 8 . 9 \%$ , and an F1 score of $8 3 . 2 \%$ ; a CNN model was applied to a manufacturing company dataset, yielding an accuracy of $8 3 . 1 \%$ , a recall of $7 5 . 4 \%$ , and an F1 score of $8 0 . 3 \%$ [1]. Beyond regional focuses like China, studies have also examined large US companies, utilizing multi-modal data such as earnings calls to predict financial distress [8]. While some research papers report using real-world bankruptcy datasets for testing, specific details regarding the companies, prediction outcomes, or practical benefits are not always explicitly provided [11].​  

Implementing these advanced prediction models in practice encounters several challenges. Data availability is a significant hurdle, as comprehensive and standardized datasets—particularly for non-public or international firms—can be difficult to obtain [15,17]. Regulatory considerations also play a crucial role, influencing data usage, model validation requirements, and the integration of model outputs into decision-making processes [15,17].​  

Despite these challenges, the demonstrated benefits of employing advanced models in practical financial risk management are considerable. These models enable the development of sophisticated risk management tools applicable in contexts like lending decisions [3]. They can provide actionable insights to companies identified with potential default risk, allowing them to proactively manage liquidity issues [5]. For regulators and financial institutions, these models facilitate the early identification of distressed firms, enabling timely interventions and mitigating broader economic impacts [2,5]. By incorporating diverse data sources, such as stock-market data, advanced models offer a more holistic view of financial risks —potentially overcoming limitations inherent in analyses relying solely on traditional financial ratios [2]. Furthermore, the framework and methodologies developed for bankruptcy prediction are adaptable and can be applied to emerging financial phenomena like risks in P2P lending or extended to other prediction tasks such as financial fraud detection and customer churn prediction [10]. The adaptability across diverse financial environments and time horizons underscores the practical utility of these advanced approaches [2].  

# 9. Challenges and Future Directions  

Developing accurate and reliable bankruptcy prediction models necessitates addressing several significant challenges related to data and model implementation. A primary hurdle is the availability, quality, and accessibility of relevant data. Publicly available datasets, while useful for foundational research, often suffer from limitations in geographical scope, temporal coverage [3], and the exclusion of crucial data types like criminal records in certain jurisdictions [13]. Accessing comprehensive data, particularly for complex entities like enterprise groups, is frequently impeded by data silos, confidentiality concerns, and inconsistencies in reporting standards across organizations and countries [15]. The need for access to full-market data to enhance model generalizability is recognized [5], yet the general acquisition of suitable datasets for bankruptcy prediction remains a significant practical difficulty [19]. Furthermore, issues such as data incompleteness [5] and the presence of outliers [7] significantly impact data quality and model reliability, underscoring the need for rigorous data cleaning and validation. Despite acknowledging these issues, systematic advancements in data accessibility and sharing are still lacking.​  

Another fundamental challenge is data imbalance and scarcity. Bankruptcy is a rare event, leading to severely imbalanced datasets where the number of non-bankrupt cases far outweighs bankrupt ones [3]. This class imbalance biases traditional models towards the majority class, impairing the accurate prediction of bankruptcies. While outlier detection might incidentally affect data distribution [7], the digests highlight the need for dedicated techniques to address imbalance and data scarcity, such as resampling or algorithmic approaches [1,5,16], although detailed comparative analyses are often not presented. Data scarcity, particularly for the minority class, also limits model generalization and calls for strategies like data augmentation or transfer learning.  

The increasing complexity of advanced predictive models introduces challenges regarding model interpretability and robustness. Models like deep learning architectures [1] and other machine learning techniques [5] often function as “black boxes” [1], making it difficult to understand the rationale behind their predictions. This lack of transparency is a major concern, especially in regulated financial domains where clear justification for risk assessments is required [1]. While model coefficients may lack interpretability [5], the overall decision-making process must be transparent [1]. Addressing interpretability is crucial for trust and adoption. Model robustness, ensuring consistent performance across different data conditions, is also vital. Some models show inherent stability [7], and methods mitigating biases can enhance robustness [10].​  

Furthermore, significant ethical and regulatory considerations frame the application of bankruptcy prediction models. Data privacy is paramount, with regulations often requiring explicit consent for using sensitive information [13]. Compliance with such requirements throughout the data processing and modeling pipeline is essential [1]. Regulatory frameworks profoundly influence how financial institutions can utilize datasets and validate models [15,17].​  

Looking ahead, future research directions must address these challenges comprehensively. A key area is the exploration and integration of novel and heterogeneous data sources [1,10]. This includes moving beyond traditional financial data to incorporate multi-modal data [1], emerging data types [10], full-market data, and challenging non-quantifiable factors like management quality [5]. Combining existing datasets with more recent or geographically diverse information is also necessary [3]. Research should also focus on developing more robust and explainable models, specifically addressing the interpretability gap [1,5] and investigating the impact of preprocessing steps on interpretability and robustness [7]. Optimizing model parameters [5] and adapting models to specific market characteristics [14], while investigating observed inconsistencies [14], are also vital. Strategies for improving data availability and sharing [19] are crucial, alongside developing better methods for identifying and quantifying complex financial structures like intra-group transactions [15]. Finally, leveraging insights and data through interdisciplinary integration [10], understanding regulatory impacts [15], and pursuing cross-domain applications [1], including real-time prediction systems [1], represent promising avenues for advancing the field.​  

# 9.1 Data Availability, Quality, and Accessibility  

Acquiring suitable datasets presents significant practical difficulties for researchers engaged in bankruptcy prediction. While some datasets are publicly available, such as the Taiwanese dataset accessible through the UCI Machine Learning Repository [3], these often possess inherent limitations. Specifically, publicly available datasets may be constrained by geographical region or specific time periods, thus limiting their generalizability to broader contexts [3]. Furthermore, certain critical data types essential for advanced prediction models, such as criminal records in specific jurisdictions like Denmark, are not publicly accessible, posing a direct challenge to widespread research in these areas [13].​  

Beyond the limitations of public data, researchers frequently encounter challenges in accessing proprietary or commercial data sources. Obtaining comprehensive data, particularly concerning complex structures like enterprise groups, is hampered by factors such as data silos, the confidential nature of proprietary information, and variations in reporting standards across different entities or countries [15]. The need for access to full-market data is also highlighted as crucial for improving model generalizability, implying that readily available datasets are often incomplete [5]. These access difficulties, including the general challenge of acquiring necessary bankruptcy prediction datasets [19], restrict the scope and depth of analysis possible in the field.​  

Data quality and consistency constitute further critical concerns. Issues such as incompleteness significantly impact the reliability and applicability of prediction models, as demonstrated by the observation that model coefficients derived from incomplete datasets may only be applicable to the specific data subset used for training [5]. Although not always directly addressed as an availability issue, researchers implicitly confront data quality challenges through practices like outlier detection and removal, which are necessary steps before model application [7]. Inconsistent reporting standards, particularly in complex corporate structures, also pose substantial challenges to data harmonization and subsequent analysis [15]. Ultimately, poor data quality and inconsistency can severely compromise model accuracy and reliability, underscoring the necessity for rigorous data cleaning and validation processes. Despite the acknowledged importance, systematic efforts and widespread success in enhancing data accessibility and sharing across diverse sources remain significant challenges in the field.​  

# 9.2 Data Imbalance and Scarcity  

A significant challenge consistently encountered in developing robust bankruptcy prediction models is the pervasive issue of data imbalance. Bankruptcy datasets are inherently imbalanced due to the infrequent occurrence of bankruptcy events relative to non-bankruptcy instances, leading to a heavily skewed class distribution ([3]). This severe imbalance can significantly impair the performance of classification models, particularly concerning the accurate identification of the minority class (bankrupt companies). Traditional machine learning algorithms, when trained on such imbalanced datasets, often exhibit a strong bias towards the majority class, resulting in high overall accuracy but poor recall and precision for the minority class. While some research implicitly deals with the effects of imbalance, specific techniques to directly address it are not always the primary focus ([7]). For instance, techniques such as outlier detection, while primarily aimed at removing noisy data points, may incidentally mitigate some negative impacts of imbalance by potentially refining the data distribution ([7]). A comprehensive analysis and comparison of the effectiveness of various dedicated techniques for handling data imbalance, such as resampling methods (e.g., SMOTE, undersampling), cost-sensitive learning, or algorithmic approaches integrated into models like deep learning architectures ([1,5,16]), would typically be crucial for this discussion. Similarly, strategies for addressing data scarcity, potentially through techniques like transfer learning or data augmentation, represent another critical dimension for improving model generalization, especially when dealing with limited instances of the minority class. However, detailed insights into the application and comparative performance of these specific imbalance handling techniques and data scarcity strategies are not present in the currently available digest information.​  

# 9.3 Model Interpretability and Robustness  

The application of complex, advanced models leveraging rich datasets in bankruptcy prediction introduces a notable tension with the critical need for interpretability, particularly within the regulated domain of financial risk management. A significant challenge highlighted in the literature is the "black box" problem [1], which arises particularly with sophisticated models like deep neural networks [1] and other machine learning approaches [5]. While these models can achieve high predictive accuracy [5], the lack of transparency regarding how predictions are derived poses difficulties for stakeholders who require clear justifications for risk assessments and decisions [1].  

Researchers emphasize the imperative for transparent decision-making processes [1], suggesting that while model coefficients or internal workings may lack interpretability [5], the overall decision logic needs to be understandable.  

Although the provided digests do not detail specific explainable AI (XAI) techniques, the acknowledged challenge of interpretability [1,5] strongly implies a potential role for XAI methods in shedding light on the factors driving model predictions in bankruptcy risk assessment, thereby mitigating the "black box" issue.​  

Beyond interpretability, model robustness is also a crucial consideration, particularly when models are applied to new or evolving data distributions. Some studies indicate that certain model architectures, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), may possess inherent advantages like good noise tolerance and stability [7]. Furthermore, methods designed to alleviate biases, such as declarative and procedural biases addressed by techniques like HSB_RS [10], contribute to enhancing model robustness and reliability against potential data shifts and inherent limitations of the learning process.  

# 9.4 Ethical and Regulatory Considerations  

The ethical and regulatory landscape surrounding bankruptcy prediction is a critical domain, encompassing concerns about data privacy, potential biases, and the influence of regulatory frameworks on data usage and model validation. A primary ethical and regulatory consideration involves data privacy. Regulations often dictate the permissible scope of data collection and usage. For example, in Denmark, accessing sensitive information such as criminal records for lending purposes requires the explicit consent of individuals, illustrating how regulations directly impact the availability and ethical use of data in financial risk assessment [13]. Consequently, researchers and practitioners must navigate complex compliance requirements throughout the data processing and model training phases to ensure responsible and lawful practices [1]. Such regulatory oversight fundamentally shapes how financial institutions can leverage datasets for developing and validating bankruptcy prediction models [15,17].​  

# 9.5 Future Research Directions  

Future research in bankruptcy prediction should prioritize the development of more sophisticated and comprehensive approaches, particularly concerning data sources, modeling techniques, and practical considerations like interpretability and robustness. A crucial direction involves developing new datasets that incorporate novel and heterogeneous data sources [1,10]. This includes integrating multi-modal data beyond traditional financial statements [1], exploring emerging sources of data [10], utilizing full-market data, and incorporating challenging non-quantifiable factors such as management capabilities or guarantees [5]. Furthermore, combining existing datasets with more recent information or data from different regions is essential to enhance the generalizability of predictive models [3].​  

Beyond data acquisition, significant research is needed in developing advanced preprocessing and modeling techniques specifically tailored for the challenging characteristics of bankruptcy data. This encompasses exploring different outlier detection and removal techniques and further examining the intricate relationship between data quality and model performance [7]. Research should also focus on optimizing model parameters [5] and developing models specifically adapted to the characteristics of particular markets or regions, such as the Chinese market [14]. Enriching methodologies toward broader applicability, such as predicting financial risks at different organizational levels or across various financial contexts, represents another promising avenue [10]. Investigating inconsistencies observed in specific models, like those between the Naïve DD model and the Z-Score in certain markets, can also yield valuable insights [14].  

Addressing lingering issues around model interpretability, robustness, and ethical deployment remains paramount. Future work should focus explicitly on improving model interpretability [1,5]. The impact of data preprocessing steps, such as instance selection, on both model interpretability and robustness warrants further investigation [7]. Developing more robust models that maintain performance across varied conditions is vital for practical application.  

Finally, exploring potential benefits of interdisciplinary collaboration is essential. This could involve understanding the impact of different regulatory environments on financial risk [15], collaborating on methods for identifying and quantifying complex financial structures like intra-group transactions [15], and investigating cross-domain applications of prediction models [1]. Developing real-time prediction systems [1] also represents a critical step towards more dynamic and actionable risk management.​  

# 10. Conclusion  

This survey has presented a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in datasets for advanced bankruptcy prediction, highlighting the evolution from reliance on traditional financial ratios towards the incorporation of increasingly diverse, advanced, and multi-modal data sources [2,8,13,15]. Research demonstrates a clear shift towards leveraging heterogeneous multisource data, with studies proposing adaptive methods like HSB_RS to effectively integrate features from varied origins and utilize emerging data sources [10]. Beyond traditional financial statements, valuable predictive information has been found in market-based variables [2], intra-group dynamics and corporate structure data [15], alternative textual and speech data capturing sentiment and emotion [8], and even non-traditional sources like the criminal records of key personnel [13]. These advancements underscore the potential of data-driven approaches to enhance financial risk management [3,8].​  

Leveraging these complex and high-dimensional datasets necessitates sophisticated machine learning techniques. Deep learning, for instance, has shown effectiveness in handling complex data and automatically extracting features for corporate bankruptcy risk prediction [1]. Similarly, SVM and hybrid SVM models are effective for capturing non-linear and nonstationary patterns prevalent in financial data, leading to more accurate forecasts [9]. The efficacy of such models is further improved by critical data processing steps. Instance selection, particularly outlier removal, has been demonstrated to enhance model performance, with SVM models exhibiting robustness in the presence of noise [7]. Feature selection techniques are also paramount, with studies indicating that methods like the t-test can significantly improve the accuracy of prediction models [12], and the integration of feature selection into algorithms like boosting shows promise [11]. While traditional models like the Naïve DD combined with Z-Score remain useful predictors [14], the field is clearly advancing through the exploration and integration of richer data landscapes and advanced computational methods [5].​  

Despite significant progress, several major challenges persist. Ensuring high data quality is critical for successful implementation [1]. Issues related to model selection, interpretability of complex models, real-time monitoring capabilities, and the challenge of cross-domain application require continued attention [1]. Furthermore, adapting models to specific markets can reveal inconsistencies and unexpected correlations, necessitating further market-specific research and model refinement [14].​  

Promising future directions include the continued exploration and integration of novel, unconventional data sources that can provide incremental predictive power. Developing robust and interpretable models capable of effectively handling and synthesizing highly heterogeneous and multi-modal data remains a key area of research [1,10]. Addressing the challenges of data quality, real-time applicability, and cross-market generalization will be crucial for the practical deployment of advanced bankruptcy prediction systems. In conclusion, continued research into expanding the breadth and depth of datasets, coupled with advancements in data-driven methodologies, is fundamental for building more accurate, robust, and interpretable bankruptcy prediction models. Such advancements are indispensable for aiding financial stakeholders in making informed decisions and for assisting regulatory bodies in maintaining financial stability [3,5,9].​
