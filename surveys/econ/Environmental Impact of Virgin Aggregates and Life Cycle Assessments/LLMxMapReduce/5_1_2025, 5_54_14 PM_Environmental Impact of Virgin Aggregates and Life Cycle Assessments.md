0. Environmental Impact of Virgin Aggregates and Life Cycle Assessments  

# 1. Introduction  

The construction sector plays a fundamental role in global infrastructure development, relying heavily on aggregates as primary building materials. Virgin aggregates, including natural sand and gravel, are consumed in vast quantities, with estimates indicating that 30–50 billion tons are mined annually for concrete production alone [3]. This scale of extraction positions the construction aggregate industry as a significant global "source-to-sink" sediment dispersal system, often exceeding natural geological processes [3]. For instance, Singapore demonstrates a high per capita consumption of aggregates, recorded at 5.4 million tonnes per person [14], while Ireland produced approximately 36 million tonnes of aggregate in a recent year [5].​

While essential for construction, the extensive extraction and processing of virgin aggregates are associated with considerable environmental and climate impacts [5]. These impacts span from habitat destruction, land degradation, and resource depletion at extraction sites to energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions during processing and transportation [8,18]. The built environment, encompassing the acquisition, use, and transformation of materials, significantly contributes to environmental burdens through material and energy use and pollutant emissions [6]. Growing awareness of ecological degradation and climate change, underscored by international agreements like the Paris Agreement and global initiatives such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is driving a global movement towards more responsible consumption and production practices in the construction industry [1,11,24].  

In response to these environmental imperatives, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has emerged as a critical methodology for comprehensively evaluating the environmental impacts of technologies, products, and processes [11,16]. LCA provides a robust framework to quantify environmental burdens across a product's entire life cycle, typically encompassing raw material extraction (cradle), manufacturing, use, and end-of-life treatment (grave) [11,29]. The core of an LCA involves a Life Cycle Inventory (LCI), which systematically quantifies energy and raw material inputs and environmental releases (emissions to air, water, and land) throughout the defined life cycle stages [21,32]. Accurate and detailed inventory data are fundamental to evaluating comparative environmental impacts and identifying potential improvements [32]. Following inventory analysis, a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) translates these inputs and outputs into potential environmental impacts, providing a more meaningful basis for comparison [32]. LCA, therefore, serves as an essential tool for enabling informed decisions on eco-efficient alternatives in construction [16].​  

A key strategy for mitigating the environmental impact of virgin aggregate use is the adoption of alternative aggregates, particularly those derived from recycled and waste materials [5,18]. Construction and demolition (C&D) waste, including demolished concrete, waste rock, and reclaimed asphalt pavement, represents a significant global challenge and a valuable potential resource [5,22]. Recycling waste concrete into recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) offers a pathway to preserve natural resources, reduce landfill dependency, and minimize environmental damage associated with virgin aggregate extraction [22,30]. Studies explore the performance and environmental benefits of incorporating RCA in various applications, such as road pavements and new concrete mixes, often utilizing LCA to quantify the environmental advantages compared to using virgin aggregates [4,7,18,22].​  

This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of the environmental impacts associated with the extensive use of virgin aggregates in the construction industry. It will delve into the application of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as a method for quantifying these impacts and guiding sustainable material selection. Furthermore, the survey will explore the potential of sustainable alternatives, particularly recycled aggregates, in reducing the environmental footprint of construction.  

# 2. Environmental Impacts of Virgin Aggregate Extraction and Processing  

The extraction and processing of virgin aggregates, fundamental inputs for the construction sector, are associated with a spectrum of significant environmental burdens [5]. These impacts manifest throughout the lifecycle, from resource extraction and subsequent processing to transportation [14].  

![](images/3d35033afd24d57591bf7d7fd3a51b6749cc3b55349657a11b4e4a99ca121375.jpg)  

The escalating global demand for construction materials places increasing pressure on natural aggregate resources, leading to concerns regarding resource depletion and the potential for localized shortages [3,14]. This intensive removal from natural systems, such as riverbeds and coastal areas, results in geomorphic alterations, habitat destruction, and long-term ecological consequences [3,14].  

Key environmental consequences directly linked to aggregate extraction and processing include land degradation and habitat loss, which can be quantified using metrics like Mean Species Abundance (MSA) to assess biodiversity impacts resulting from land use changes associated with infrastructure development [27]. Furthermore, these operations are significant contributors to energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly during extraction, crushing, and transportation phases [10,27]. The environmental footprint varies based on aggregate type, extraction methodology, transportation modes, and distances, highlighting the importance of comprehensive analyses across the entire process chain [10].  

Water and air quality are also adversely affected. Extraction activities, especially sand mining in active hydrological systems, increase suspended sediment loads in water bodies [3], while processing can lead to heavy metal leaching from materials like crushed stone [14]. Airborne particulate matter, such as silt and crusher dust generated during mechanical processing, impacts ambient air quality and necessitates control measures like dedusting processes [28]. The process also generates substantial waste streams, including solid rejects and stone slurry, requiring effective waste management strategies to minimize environmental impact and explore opportunities for material reuse [14,28]. While this section primarily focuses on virgin aggregate impacts, it is recognized that extraction activities extend to various environments, including potentially marine contexts, which present unique environmental challenges [3,14,17]. Subsequent sections will delve deeper into these specific impact categories, detailing the mechanisms, quantifying the burdens where possible, and discussing current challenges and mitigation efforts.​  

# 2.1 Resource Depletion and Land Degradation  

The escalating global demand for construction materials has resulted in aggregate consumption rates that significantly exceed natural renewal capacities [14]. The worldwide market for construction aggregates is projected to expand at a considerable annual rate of $5 . 2 \%$ [14], exacerbating concerns regarding resource scarcity. This intensive extraction brings the concept of "peak sand" into focus, reflecting the potential depletion of readily accessible and sustainable sand and gravel resources [3]. While natural sand and gravel are sourced from both old deposits and active systems, mining from active systems is often preferred due to its speed and lower immediate cost, despite its inherent unsustainability and frequent illegality [3]. This unsustainable approach leads to a deficit in sediment supply within natural systems, triggering a compensatory re-equilibration process that effectively “cannibalizes” older, stable deposits [3], further degrading the resource base.​  

The physical processes of aggregate extraction contribute substantially to land degradation globally and regionally. Quarrying and mining operations disrupt natural landscapes, leading to severe impacts such as habitat fragmentation, soil erosion, and, in some contexts, deforestation. These physical alterations trigger a cascade of long-term ecological and economic consequences. A significant ecological consequence is the loss of biodiversity, which can be quantified using indicators such as Mean Species Abundance (MSA) [27]. Studies indicate that land use changes associated with infrastructure development, including aggregate-intensive construction, contribute to biodiversity loss by replacing natural habitats [27]. The use of metrics like MSA, based on data sources such as FAO, the Global Roads Inventory Project (GRIP), and the global terrestrial biodiversity model GLOBIO, allows for the quantification of biodiversity loss per unit of land use, highlighting the environmental footprint of aggregate extraction and its downstream applications [27]. The cumulative effects of resource depletion and land degradation manifest in regional shortages, as exemplified by Singapore facing constraints on natural sand imports [14], underscoring the pressing need for sustainable resource management strategies.  

# 2.2 Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emissions  

The production and transportation of virgin aggregates are associated with significant energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [10]. These processes, encompassing activities such as extraction, crushing, and transportation, are recognized as energy-intensive [27]. The resulting GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide $( \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 } )$ , methane $( C H _ { 4 } )$ , and nitrous oxide $( N _ { 2 } O )$ , contribute to environmental impacts such as biodiversity loss, which can be quantified using factors like MSA-loss $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { \sigma } _ { \cdot }$ ha $\cdot$ yr per kg $C O _ { 2 }$ -equivalents [27]. A comprehensive analysis in this domain typically involves quantifying energy use and emissions across each stage of the aggregate lifecycle, identifying the primary sources of these environmental burdens, comparing the carbon footprint associated with different aggregate types and production methodologies, and evaluating the influence of transportation modes (e.g., truck, rail, barge) and distances on the overall environmental profile [4,10].​

# 2.3 Water and Air Pollution  

Virgin aggregate extraction processes inherently interact with the environment, potentially impacting water and air quality through various mechanisms. Water pollution concerns arise from operations such as sand mining and quarrying. Extraction activities in active hydrological systems, particularly sand mining, have been observed to increase the load of suspended sediment in water bodies [3]. Furthermore, the processing of aggregates, such as the washing of crushed stone (CS), can lead to the leaching of heavy metals into the surrounding soil and groundwater, posing environmental concerns [14]. Quarry runoff itself can contain various pollutants. While not directly focused on aggregate extraction, research exploring advanced water treatment methods—such as the electrochemical removal of sulfide from water using modified stainless steel surfaces —highlights the potential presence of specific pollutants like sulfide in industrial wastewaters, which could potentially be relevant in the context of quarry operations [33].​  

Effective management of quarry runoff and process water is therefore crucial to mitigate the impacts of suspended solids, heavy metals, and other potential contaminants on aquatic ecosystems and water quality.  

In addition to water impacts, aggregate extraction and processing activities contribute to air pollution. The mechanical processes of extraction, hauling, and crushing are significant sources of fine airborne materials—including silt and crusher dust—that are emitted into the surrounding atmosphere [28]. These particulate emissions affect ambient air quality and can have implications for human health and ecosystems. Regulatory standards often impose limits on the content of fine material in finished aggregate products, such as $1 \%$ for coarse crushed aggregates used in structural concrete and $1 5 \%$ for crushed stone sand [28]. To comply with these regulations and minimize atmospheric emissions, implementing suitable dedusting processes during crushing and handling is necessary [28]. Such measures represent current pollution control practices aimed at reducing the quantity of airborne particulates released during aggregate production. The effectiveness of these measures and the potential for implementing further best management practices—such as water spraying on haul roads and material stockpiles or enclosure of dusty operations—are critical considerations for minimizing the overall air quality impact of virgin aggregate extraction.  

# 2.4 Quarrying Processes and Waste Management  

Quarrying and the subsequent processing of virgin aggregates inherently generate various waste streams and by-products, significantly impacting the environmental footprint of aggregate production [28]. These wastes arise from rejects at the quarry sites, due to unsuitable material characteristics or sizing, and from processing units, particularly during crushing, screening, sawing, and polishing operations [28].

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>CS from Singapore)</td><td>certain aggregate types</td><td>tonnes/year (Singapore example)</td><td>Potential Utilization (in concrete)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The primary types of waste include solid waste and stone slurry [28].  

Solid waste typically consists of coarse or fine rejects from initial quarrying and crushing processes [28]. Stone slurry, on the other hand, is a semi-liquid by-product predominantly from sawing and polishing activities, composed of finely ground stone particles suspended in the water used for cooling and lubrication [28]. A specific classification within the fine waste category is quarry fines, defined as aggregate fractions smaller than $6 3 \mu \mathrm { m }$ [28]. The composition and particle size distribution of these fines vary significantly depending on the source rock [28]. For instance, granite dust typically exhibits high $\mathsf { S i O } _ { 2 }$ $( 6 9 . 8 8 \% )$ and $A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 }$ ( $1 2 . 2 1 \% )$ content, while marble and limestone dust are dominated by CaO, at $5 5 . 2 6 \%$ and $5 5 . 4 4 \%$ respectively, alongside high loss on ignition values ( $4 3 . 5 2 \%$ for marble, $4 2 . 9 8 \%$ for limestone), indicative of carbonate decomposition [28]. Size grading also differs; marble dust shows a d50 of $7 \mu \mathrm { m }$ and ${ \mathsf { d } } 9 0$ of $5 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ , while granite dust has larger particles $( \mathsf { d } 5 0 \mathsf { 9 } \mu \mathsf { m }$ , ${ \mathsf { d } } 9 0 8 0 \mu { \mathsf { m } } ^ { }$ ) and limestone dust falls in between $( \mathsf { d } 5 0 \ 1 8 \ \mu \mathsf { m }$ , $\mathsf { d } 9 0 4 0 \mu \mathsf { m } _ { \cdot }$ ) [28]. Quantities of these wastes can be substantial; for example, Singapore alone needs to dispose of approximately 0.4 million tonnes of washed coral sand (CS) annually, highlighting the scale of waste generation in specific contexts [14].​  

Current waste management strategies often involve disposal, with landfilling being a common practice [14,28]. However, landfilling stone slurry, particularly after its water content is reduced, results in the formation of stone dust, which poses several environmental challenges [28]. Recognizing the environmental and economic drawbacks of disposal, increasing attention is being paid to the potential utilization of quarry by-products [14,28]. Recycling washed CS in concrete mixtures, for instance, presents a viable method to eliminate the need for solid waste disposal in limited landfill areas [14].  

The classification of quarry by-products as post-industrial recycled materials is increasingly pertinent given their potential for reuse. Materials like quarry fines and stone slurry are generated as an unavoidable consequence of processing virgin rock resources [28]. Their successful reincorporation into manufacturing processes, such as concrete or asphalt production, effectively diverts them from the waste stream and conserves virgin resources, aligning with the principles of a circular economy and supporting their classification as valuable secondary materials [14]. This reclassification necessitates a thorough understanding of their physical and chemical properties, as detailed by studies on the composition and size grading of fine by-products [28], to ensure their suitability and performance in new applications.  

# 3. Life Cycle Assessment Methodology for Aggregates  

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a standardized methodology employed to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to end-of-life treatment [11,34]. In the context of aggregate production and use, LCA provides a comprehensive framework for quantifying the environmental burdens associated with resource consumption, emissions, and waste generation across various stages, including quarrying, processing, transportation, construction, use, maintenance, and decommissioning [2,4,19].  

![](images/65c21d1db190ab1bd07d0d960c1f179a7f2c3a7a29da157d5beb442eb99df731.jpg)  

The standard LCA framework, as defined by ISO 14040 and 14044, comprises four iterative stages: Goal and Scope Definition, Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) Analysis, Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA), and Interpretation [11,21,32].  

The initial stage, Goal and Scope Definition, is fundamental, setting the purpose and boundaries of the study [32]. The goal outlines the study's intended application and audience, while the scope defines the system under investigation, including the functional unit, system boundaries, data requirements, and assumptions. The choice of functional unit is critical for enabling comparisons between different aggregate types, concrete mixes, or construction systems that fulfil the same function [32]. Common functional units in aggregate-related LCAs include one cubic meter $( 1 m ^ { 3 } )$ of concrete, one tonne ( ${ } ^ { 1 t }$ ) of aggregate, or unit areas of structural systems [2,14,16,21]. Some studies normalize functional units by performance criteria, such as compressive strength for concrete, to account for material property differences [14]. Variations in functional unit definitions significantly impact the comparability of results across different studies. System boundaries define which processes and life cycle stages are included [32]. Typical boundaries in aggregate and construction LCAs range from "cradleto-gate" (raw materials to factory gate) to "cradle-to-site" (including transportation to construction site and assembly) or the more comprehensive "cradle-to-grave" (including use and end-of-life phases) [2,4,14,16,21,34]. Data availability often dictates the feasible system boundary [16]. Different studies employ varying system boundaries depending on their specific focus, which is a primary reason for inconsistencies or lack of direct comparability between assessments, even for similar products or systems [32].​  

The Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) Analysis involves systematically collecting and quantifying all relevant inputs (raw material energy, water, etc.) and outputs (emissions to air, water, soil; waste) for each process within the defined system boundaries [2,15,32]. For aggregate production and use, LCI includes data on material extraction, processing (e.g., crushing, screening, sintering), transportation, cement production, concrete batching, and construction activities [4,14,16]. LCI data can be gathered through various methods, including process modeling or converting Bill of Quantity (BOQ) data into Bill of Materials (BOM) [15,16]. Data sources are diverse, including published literature, industry data, government reports, trade statistics, and comprehensive LCI databases like Ecoinvent or US LCI [14,15,16,21,27,32]. These databases provide background data for common industrial processes, complementing study-specific foreground data [32]. However, significant challenges exist in obtaining accurate and representative LCI data for aggregate LCAs. Data is often regionally specific and may not accurately reflect local production methods or energy mixes in different geographical areas [2,4]. Furthermore, the high variability in the properties and production processes of alternative materials like recycled aggregates leads to significant variability in their LCI data, underscoring the need for comprehensive, transparent, and potentially site-specific data collection [7]. Data gaps often necessitate assumptions or the use of proxy data, introducing uncertainty into the inventory [32]. Allocation, necessary when a process yields multiple products, is another methodological challenge in LCI, though specific allocation methods used in aggregate studies are not detailed in the provided digests. The quality and reliability of LCI data, assessed using data quality indicators and pedigree matrices, are paramount for the credibility of LCA results [32].  

The third stage, Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA), translates the compiled LCI data into potential environmental impacts [32]. This involves selecting relevant impact categories and applying characterization factors (CFs) to quantify the contribution of inventory flows to these categories [16]. Common impact categories assessed in aggregate-related studies include Global Warming Potential (GWP), Acidification Potential (AP), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Ozone Depletion Potential, Abiotic Depletion Potential (ADP), Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POFP), toxicity (human and eco-), water use, land use, and biodiversity loss [2,4,7,14,15,16,21,27]. Various LCIA methodologies exist, such as CML-IA, TRACI, and ReCiPe, each with different approaches to categorization and characterization [14,16,21,31]. The environmental impact for a category is typically calculated as the sum of the product of each substance quantity and its corresponding characterization factor [16]:​  

$$
E I _ { j } = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } q _ { i } \times C F _ { j i }
$$  

where $E I _ { j }$ ​ is the environmental impact for category $~ j ~ , q _ { i }$ is the quantity of substance $\mathbf { \chi } _ { i }$ , and $C F _ { j i }$ ​ is the characterization factor for substance $\mathbf { \chi } _ { i }$ in category $j$ . The choice of LCIA method and the underlying characterization factors, which depend on data specificity (e.g., regional vs. generic), can significantly influence the results. Normalization can be applied to compare impacts across different categories by relating them to a reference system [16].​  

The final stage, Interpretation, involves analyzing the LCIA results to identify significant environmental issues, evaluate the robustness of findings, and draw conclusions in relation to the study goal [16,21]. This includes identifying "hotspots" – processes or materials contributing most significantly to the overall environmental burden, such as energy consumption in aggregate processing or the impacts of cement and natural aggregates in concrete [2,16,21]. Sensitivity analysis is a crucial part of the interpretation phase, assessing how variations in key input parameters affect the results [7,15,32]. Parameters frequently tested for sensitivity include transportation distances, energy source mix, material ratios (e.g., natural vs. recycled aggregate content), and the properties of alternative materials [2,4,7]. Uncertainty analysis quantifies the overall variability in results due to data and model uncertainties, often employing methods like Monte Carlo simulation [15,31]. Together, interpretation, sensitivity, and uncertainty analysis provide insights into the reliability of the LCA results and highlight critical factors influencing environmental performance.  

Current LCA studies on virgin aggregates, while valuable, face limitations in fully capturing all potential environmental impacts and ensuring result comparability [11]. Challenges include data gaps for specific regional processes, the variability and lack of transparent data for alternative or recycled materials [7,32], and complexities in accurately modeling long-term impacts or the use and end-of-life phases, which are often excluded due to data constraints [16]. The choice of system boundary, functional unit, LCI data sources, and LCIA methodology introduces variability, making direct comparisons between studies difficult without careful consideration of methodological differences [32]. Future improvements in aggregate LCA studies should focus on enhancing the availability and quality of regional and material-specific LCI data, particularly for recycled and alternative aggregates. Developing standardized guidelines for system boundaries, functional units, and allocation methods specific to aggregates and concrete could improve comparability. Furthermore, incorporating more comprehensive impact categories, such as detailed toxicity assessments, land use change impacts beyond simple area measurement, and potential long-term effects during the use phase, would provide a more complete picture of the environmental footprint of virgin aggregates [21,27]. Emphasizing transparent reporting of data sources, assumptions, and methodological choices, along with conducting robust sensitivity and uncertainty analyses, is essential to improve the reliability and utility of aggregate LCA results for decision-making.

The definition of the goal and scope forms the foundational step in any Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), significantly influencing the data collection, methodology, and ultimately, the results and conclusions drawn from the analysis [32]. The goal specifies the purpose of the study and its intended audience, while the scope defines the product system to be studied, including the functional unit, system boundaries, data requirements, and assumptions. Variations in these parameters  

among studies are a primary reason for potential inconsistencies or lack of comparability in LCA outcomes for similar products or services.  

The goal of an LCA study typically dictates the focus of the environmental impact assessment. For instance, some studies specifically aim to quantify the total energy use and environmental damage associated with building construction [16], while others focus narrowly on assessing the environmental impact of producing specific alternative materials like recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) [4], sintered fly ash aggregate (SFA) [2], or circular concrete mixes incorporating recycled materials [7]. Broader goals might encompass understanding the environmental impacts across the entire lifespan of concrete structures to improve sustainability management [34]. The specificity of the goal directs the subsequent definition of the study's scope and methodology.​  

The choice of a functional unit is critical as it provides a reference flow to which all inputs and outputs in the LCA are related, enabling comparison between different systems or products that fulfill the same function. The functional unit selected must clearly define the function, the magnitude of the function, the duration of the function, and the quality required to fulfill the function. In studies concerning aggregates and concrete, various functional units are employed depending on the study's focus. Common choices include one cubic meter $( 1 m ^ { 3 } )$ of concrete, which is used when comparing different concrete mix designs or types of concrete for structural applications. Alternatively, studies focusing on aggregate production might use one tonne $( 1 t )$ of aggregate as the functional unit [2]. For building-level assessments, the functional unit can be defined as the construction of a specific building at a given location [16] or a unit area of a structural system, such as $2 6 0 m ^ { 2 }$ of external wall systems [21]. Studies on specific technologies like $C O _ { 2 }$ capture define functional units based on the output of the process, such as one tonne of captured $C O _ { 2 }$ per year over a plant lifetime [31]. The functional unit can also be normalized by performance criteria, such as one cubic meter of high-strength concrete normalized by its 28-day compressive strength [14], to account for differences in material performance. Using different functional units, such as cubic meter versus mass or including performance normalization, can significantly impact the numerical results and make direct comparisons between studies challenging unless appropriate normalization is applied. For instance, comparing the environmental impact per cubic meter of standard concrete to that of high-strength concrete per cubic meter without considering strength differences might misrepresent the environmental efficiency when structural performance is the primary function.​  

System boundaries determine which processes and life cycle stages are included within the LCA, directly impacting the comprehensiveness of the inventory and the final environmental profile. Common system boundaries in aggregate and concrete LCA studies include "cradle-to-gate", which typically covers raw material extraction, transportation, and manufacturing processes up to the point the product leaves the factory gate [2,14]. A "cradle-to-site" boundary extends this to include transportation to the construction site and on-site construction processes [16,21]. A full "cradle-to-grave" assessment would ideally encompass the entire life cycle, including the use phase, maintenance, and end-of-life disposition (e.g., demolition, recycling, landfilling) [4,34]. However, data availability often restricts the system boundary; for example, the use and end-of-life phases might be excluded if reliable data is unavailable [16]. The selection of system boundaries necessitates a clear definition of the life cycle inventory, identifying and quantifying inputs and outputs that cross the defined boundary [32]. Crucially, even with theoretically similar system boundaries, the specific components included in the life cycle inventory can vary, thereby influencing the LCA outcome and highlighting which components contribute most significantly to environmental impacts like GHG emissions [32]. Excluding relevant stages or significant inputs/outputs within the chosen boundary can lead to an incomplete or misleading assessment. While allocation methods are also a critical aspect of the scope definition, particularly in multi-output systems, the provided digests do not offer specific examples or discussions on how different allocation approaches were applied or how they affected results in the context of aggregate LCAs. Nevertheless, the influence of system boundary and the included inventory on the outcome underscores the necessity for transparent and consistent reporting in LCA studies to ensure results are properly understood and comparable within their defined context.​  

# 3.2 Life Cycle Inventory Analysis  

The Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) phase constitutes a pivotal step in Life Cycle Assessment, dedicated to the systematic collection and compilation of quantitative data for all relevant inputs and outputs associated with a product system across its defined life cycle stages. This process meticulously accounts for the consumption of raw materials, various forms of energy inputs such as heat, electricity, and fuels (e.g., diesel), water usage, and other variable operational expenses [2,15]. Concurrently, outputs such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, other atmospheric pollutants, land use alterations  

(including infrastructure impacts), potential toxicity effects, waste generation (including waste directed to landfilling), and water effluents are quantified [2,4,15,27]. Specifically for aggregate production and their subsequent utilization in construction, the LCI encompasses data pertaining to the extraction, processing, and production of primary constituents like cement and aggregates, the logistics and transportation of these materials to the site, and on-site construction activities including concrete batching and the operation of machinery [4,14,16].  

Several methods are employed for compiling LCI data. Process models, for instance, are utilized to estimate material and energy flows within the system boundaries [15]. Alternatively, particularly in construction contexts, detailed material quantities can be ascertained by converting Bill of Quantity (BOQ) data into Bill of Materials (BOM) using official analysis of rate documents, which provide standardized proportions of materials required for specific work items [16]. Transportationrelated impacts are typically calculated by considering factors such as the carrying capacity of vehicles, travel distances, and fuel efficiency [16].​  

Data sources for LCI are diverse, drawing from a combination of published literature, proprietary industry data, official governmental documents, international trade statistics, and established life cycle inventory databases [14,15,16,21,27]. Generic databases, such as US LCI, Ecoinvent, and various European counterparts, serve as invaluable repositories providing pre-compiled "background system" data for common industrial processes, thereby diminishing the necessity for researchers to construct comprehensive supply chain models from inception [21,32]. Industry-specific databases can furnish data on aspects like pricing [15], while direct data from manufacturers or suppliers offers specific inputs related to material sourcing locations and production specifics [21]. Trade data, such as import/export statistics (e.g., cement and aggregate import data for Singapore), can be leveraged to refine generic data to better reflect regional supply chains [14]. Furthermore, data from previously conducted LCAs on similar systems may also be incorporated, provided their scope and quality are deemed relevant [31].  

Notwithstanding the array of available data sources, significant challenges persist in acquiring LCI data that is simultaneously accurate, representative, and complete, particularly concerning virgin aggregates and their downstream use. A prominent challenge is the inherent regional specificity of much available data [2,4], which may not reliably depict the precise production methodologies, energy mixes, or material compositions prevalent in alternative geographical areas. Furthermore, certain material types, such as recycled aggregates, exhibit substantial variability in their properties and the processes involved in their production depending on the specific source [7]. This variability translates directly into high variability in LCI data for these materials, emphasizing the critical need for comprehensive and transparent data collection tailored to such variable inputs [7]. Obtaining primary data directly from industrial operators is frequently resourceintensive and may encounter issues related to data confidentiality or availability. Conversely, relying solely on secondary data from generic databases or literature may compromise the representativeness of the inventory if the data does not closely align with the specific materials, technologies, or temporal context of the study [21]. Data gaps represent another limitation, often necessitating the use of assumptions, estimations, or proxy data, which invariably introduce uncertainty into the inventory.​  

The quality and accessibility of LCI data profoundly influence the reliability and credibility of the resulting LCA outcomes. The utilization of non-representative data – whether geographically inappropriate, outdated, or based on substantially different production technologies – can lead to distorted and inaccurate environmental impact assessments. The documented variability in LCI data for materials like recycled aggregates highlights the sensitivity of LCA results to input data and underscores the necessity for meticulous selection of data sources and explicit acknowledgement of associated uncertainties [7]. While reliance on databases enhances efficiency, the dependability of the LCA is intrinsically linked to the underlying quality, transparency, and relevance of the database entries [32]. Consequently, ensuring the accuracy, representativeness, and completeness of LCI data, coupled with transparently documenting any data gaps or assumptions, is paramount for conducting rigorous and defensible LCAs of aggregate systems.​

Following the compilation of the life cycle inventory (LCI), the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) phase translates the inventory data into potential environmental impacts [32]. This phase involves selecting relevant impact categories, classifying inventory data into these categories, and characterizing the potential impacts using specific factors. While LCI provides detailed input and output flows, LCIA offers a more consolidated and meaningful basis for comparing the environmental performance of different systems or materials [32].  

The selection of impact categories in LCIA varies across studies, reflecting the diverse range of potential environmental burdens associated with construction materials and aggregate production. Common categories assessed include energy use [15,16], global warming potential (GWP) or carbon emissions [2,4,7,14,15,16], ozone depletion potential [14,16,21], acidification potential (AP) [2,14,16], and eutrophication potential (EP) [2,14,16]. Other considered impacts extend to photochemical ozone creation potential (POFP) [14,16], land use [15], toxicity (human toxicity, ecotoxicity) [14,15], water use [15], abiotic depletion potential (ADP) [2], marine eutrophication [14], particulate matter (PM) formation [14], and biodiversity loss, sometimes quantified using indicators such as Mean Species Abundance (MSA) derived from models like GLOBIO [27]. Some analyses may focus primarily on key indicators like carbon emissions for specific comparisons, such as between concretes made with recycled versus natural aggregates or different cement types [4,7].  

Various impact assessment methodologies are employed in the literature. Examples include CML–IA version 4.1 [16], TRACI 2 V3.01 [21], and ReCiPe [14,31]. CML-IA has been used in conjunction with regional databases, such as the India construction materials database (ICMD), to derive characterization factors representative of local conditions [16]. TRACI has been applied to compare the environmental performance across multiple categories for different structural systems in building construction [21]. ReCiPe is regarded as a methodologically compliant and uniform approach, with studies adapting its guidelines, for instance, by selecting the midpoint-oriented method due to considerations like regional data uncertainty [14,31]. The choice of method and its settings (e.g., midpoint vs. endpoint perspective in ReCiPe) can influence the resulting impact profiles. Databases such as EcoInvent are commonly integrated with LCA software like openLCA to provide the necessary inventory data and characterization factors for these methods [31].​  

A critical component of LCIA is the application of characterization factors (CFs). These factors quantify the potential contribution of a unit of inventory input or output (e.g., $1 \kappa \mathrm { g }$ of $C O _ { 2 }$ emission) to a specific environmental impact category (e.g., GWP expressed in $k g C O _ { 2 }$ equivalent). Characterization factors are typically derived from databases or literature reviews, often based on underlying inventory data that reflects specific processes and regional contexts [16]. The total environmental impact (EI_j) for a given domain j is calculated by summing the product of the quantity $( \mathsf { q \_ i } )$ of each material or substance i and its corresponding characterization factor (CF_{ji}) for that domain, as shown in the following equation [16]:​  

$$
E I _ { j } = \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { n } q _ { i } \times C F _ { j i }
$$  

The representativeness and accuracy of these characterization factors, which depend on the quality and specificity of the underlying inventory data (e.g., local vs. generic data sources), significantly influence the final impact scores. Differences in CFs across databases or regional datasets can lead to variations in assessment outcomes.​  

To facilitate comparison across different impact categories, which are often measured in disparate units, normalization can be performed [16]. Normalization involves dividing the calculated environmental impact for a domain (EI_j) by a chosen normalization factor (NF_j), often representing the total impact of a reference system (e.g., a region or person per year), yielding a dimensionless normalized environmental impact (NEI_j) [16]:  

$$
N E I _ { j } = \frac { E I _ { j } } { N F _ { j } }
$$  

Normalization allows researchers to assess the relative severity of impacts across different environmental domains, providing a broader perspective for interpreting results. The choice of normalization factors can also influence the perceived relative importance of different impact categories.​  

LCIA results enable the identification of major contributors to environmental burdens within a product system. For instance, analyses show that material usage, particularly concrete, often constitutes a dominant factor in the overall environmental impacts across various categories during the construction phase [21]. Specific components or materials are identified as hotspots based on their high impact scores relative to their quantity or the impact factors associated with their production and use [21]. Therefore, LCIA plays a crucial role in pinpointing areas where mitigation efforts, such as material substitution or process efficiency improvements, can yield the most significant environmental benefits.​  

# 3.4 Interpretation and Sensitivity Analysis  

Interpreting the results of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is crucial for identifying the primary environmental burdens associated with aggregates and related construction materials, thereby pinpointing opportunities for reduction. This stage involves a detailed breakdown of impacts across different life cycle stages, processes, and constituent materials to highlight contributions to the overall environmental profile [16,21]. For instance, studies on aggregate production often identify energy consumption, such as heat consumption in sintering processes and electricity usage in various unit operations, as major contributors to environmental impacts [2]. Similarly, for composite materials like concrete, analyses can reveal the significant impacts stemming from conventional components like cement and natural aggregates, contrasting them with the performance of alternative or recycled materials [16]. Through this process, researchers can discern which specific activities or inputs within the life cycle system exert the most significant environmental pressure, guiding efforts towards optimization and the adoption of less impactful alternatives [16].  

Following the initial interpretation, conducting sensitivity and uncertainty analyses is vital to evaluate the robustness of the LCA results and understand the influence of variable parameters [7,15]. Sensitivity analysis systematically varies key input parameters over a defined range to determine their impact on the final environmental outcomes. This helps in identifying parameters that are critical drivers of the overall environmental performance of aggregates and related materials [15]. Common parameters examined include transportation distances, the mix of energy sources used in production processes, variations in raw material quality or source, and the ratios of conventional to alternative or recycled materials [4,7]. For example, the transportation distance of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) like fly ash has been identified as a key factor influencing the environmental benefits derived from their use as cement replacements [4]. Studies also explore the sensitivity of results to different proportions of natural versus recycled aggregates [4]. Evaluating alternative scenarios, such as using different energy sources (e.g., biomass-based OFF gas versus grid electricity), is another form of sensitivity analysis that assesses potential impact reductions [2]. Sensitivity analysis is also crucial for understanding the potential range of impacts by considering best-case and worst-case scenarios, particularly when assessing sustainable material mixes [7].​  

Uncertainty analysis complements sensitivity analysis by quantifying the overall variability in results due to uncertain input data or model choices. Methods like Monte Carlo simulation, which involves running the model multiple times with inputs randomly sampled from defined probability distributions, are employed to determine the uncertainty range of the LCA outcomes [31]. Together, interpretation, sensitivity, and uncertainty analysis provide a comprehensive understanding of the environmental performance of aggregates, highlighting key impact factors, assessing the reliability of results, and guiding strategic decisions for environmental improvement in the construction sector.​  

# 4. Alternative Aggregates: Types, Production, Properties, and Performance  

Alternative aggregates represent a crucial strategy for mitigating the environmental impacts associated with virgin aggregate extraction and reducing reliance on finite natural resources [1]. These materials are primarily derived from various waste streams, with construction and demolition (C&D) waste being a significant source, yielding materials such as recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) and recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) [18,22,25]. Other important sources include industrial by-products like fly ash, copper slag, quarry dust, steel slag, and waste from ornamental stone industries [2,14,28]. Additionally, innovative processes like carbon mineralization can transform calcium and magnesium-rich industrial by-products and rocks into potential aggregate materials [23], and cold sintering offers pathways to utilize postconsumer plastics in composites suitable for aggregate applications [13].​  

The production of alternative aggregates involves diverse processing techniques tailored to the source material. For C&D waste, this typically includes crushing, screening, and magnetic separation to remove contaminants like residual steel [25,30]. Thermal processes like sintering are used for materials such as fly ash to form durable aggregates [2], while cold sintering offers a low-temperature approach for combining inorganic waste with plastics [13]. A critical challenge across these processes is ensuring consistent material quality and effectively removing contaminants, which is essential for the successful application of the resulting aggregates [18,25]. Utilizing these waste streams through efficient processing diverts materials from landfills and contributes to a more circular economy [1,5].  

The properties of alternative aggregates differ from those of virgin aggregates, largely influenced by their source and processing. RCA, for instance, often contains residual cement paste, leading to higher water absorption and lower specific gravity compared to natural aggregates [25,30]. Mechanical properties such as crushing value, impact value, and abrasion resistance can also be impacted by the presence of recycled content [22]. Other alternative materials like copper slag or quarry dust possess unique characteristics, such as different specific gravities or chemical compositions [14,28]. A major challenge is the inherent variability and heterogeneity of recycled materials, which necessitates rigorous characterization and quality control to meet engineering standards [18].​  

Research evaluating the performance of concrete and other materials incorporating alternative aggregates demonstrates their viability for various construction applications. While the use of RCA can influence fresh concrete properties like workability and may lead to reductions in the strength and durability of hardened concrete, particularly at higher replacement levels, it has been successfully used in Portland cement concrete and deemed suitable for applications like road sub-bases and asphalt mixtures, especially for lower volume roads [18,22,25,30]. The performance is significantly affected by the alternative aggregate type, replacement ratio, and the overall mix design. For example, while high amounts of certain fine wastes can negatively impact concrete properties [28], incorporating supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) or optimizing binder composition can mitigate some of the drawbacks associated with alternative aggregates and enhance overall performance and durability, contributing to lower environmental impacts [4,7,14]. The application suitability of alternative aggregates, therefore, depends on a careful balance of their specific properties, processing quality, replacement level, and complementary material use.​  

# 4.1 Sources and Production Methods of Alternative Aggregates  

Alternative aggregates derived from waste streams, particularly construction and demolition (C&D) waste and industrial byproducts, represent a significant potential for sustainable aggregate production [1]. These materials serve as substitutes for conventionally mined aggregates, contributing to resource conservation and waste reduction [1].  

C&D waste is a primary source, encompassing demolished concrete from buildings, roads, and other structures, yielding recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) and recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) [18,22,25]. Recycled concrete products can also include recycled concrete powder and coarse and fine recycled concrete aggregates [7]. Industrial by‐products offer another avenue, including materials like copper slag (CS), quarry dust, fly ash, steel slag, and cement kiln dust [2,14,23,28].  

For instance, CS, a by‐product originally used for abrasive purposes, was historically landfilled after losing its abrasive properties [14]. Similarly, large quantities of quarry dust are generated during limestone aggregate production but are often discharged to landfills [28]. Waste from the ornamental stone industry also faces landfill disposal [28]. Certain industrial by‐ products rich in Mg and Ca, such as mantle peridotite, basaltic lava, ultramafic plutons, mafic and ultramafic mine tailings, cement kiln dust, steel slag, and fly ash, are identified as potential sources for carbon mineralization processes [23]. Post‐ consumer plastics also present a source for alternative aggregates [13,15].  

The production processes for alternative aggregates vary depending on the source material. For RCA, the method involves breaking, removing, and crushing existing concrete to a specified size and quality [30]. This typically occurs in stationary or mobile recycling plants [25]. Stationary plants often utilize a two‐stage crushing process (jaw crushers followed by impact crushers), while mobile plants are usually limited to one‐stage crushing [25]. Following primary crushing, magnetic separation is employed to remove residual reinforcement [25]. Screening is performed to achieve desired aggregate sizes [25]. C&D processing may also involve segregating waste concrete and mixing it with sand to achieve properties comparable to virgin aggregates [22]. Meeting certified engineering and quality standards is crucial to ensure the resulting material is fit‐for‐purpose [5].​  

A significant challenge in processing C&D waste and other by‐products is the removal of contaminants and ensuring consistent material quality [25]. Contaminants in RCA can include dirt, plaster, gypsum, and other building waste, which must be carefully removed through methods like water cleaning or air sifting [25]. The presence of impurities can negatively impact the properties of the final aggregate and its performance in applications like concrete or asphalt mixtures [18]. Achieving a consistent quality, comparable to virgin aggregates, requires rigorous processing and quality control [5].​  

Beyond mechanical processing, other techniques are employed for specific industrial by‐products. For sintered fly ash aggregate (SFA), the primary source material is fly ash [2]. The production process involves raw material handling and mixing, palletization, sintering, and screening [2]. This thermal process transforms fine fly ash particles into larger, durable aggregate pellets. For post‐consumer plastics, alternative aggregates can be created using cold sintering, a process that consolidates inorganic powders with plastic at low temperatures using water as a promoter, allowing for direct reprocessing and recycling of composites [13]. Other plastic recycling technologies, while not always yielding direct aggregates, involve processes like mechanical recycling (sorting, shredding, washing, extrusion), dissolution (dissolving polymer in solvent), enzymatic hydrolysis, glycolysis, and methanolysis, which yield monomers or oligomers that could potentially serve as precursors or binders in aggregate production [15].​  

Comparing production processes, mechanical recycling of C&D waste [25] involves physical size reduction and separation techniques, whereas processes like sintering [2] and cold sintering [13] involve thermal or low‐temperature physico‐ chemical consolidation, suitable for finer or plastic‐containing waste streams. The environmental impacts differ accordingly, with mechanical processes primarily involving energy consumption for crushing and hauling, while sintering involves high‐temperature processes and cold sintering offers a lower‐energy alternative for specific materials. The current practice of landfilling potentially valuable by‐products like quarry dust and used CS highlights an environmental burden and lost opportunity for sustainable aggregate sourcing [14,28]. Utilizing these alternative sources requires addressing processing challenges, particularly contaminant removal and quality assurance, through appropriate mechanical, physical, or chemical methods to realize their full potential in replacing virgin aggregates.​  

# 4.2 Properties and Characterization of Alternative Aggregates  

Characterizing the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of alternative aggregates is crucial for their effective utilization in construction materials and for assessing their environmental impact via life cycle assessments. A primary focus in research is comparing these properties to those of virgin aggregates to understand their potential performance and limitations [25,30].​  

Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) is a widely studied alternative. A significant difference between the physical properties of RCA and natural aggregate stems from the residual cement paste adhering to the aggregate particles after crushing [25]. This adherent mortar layer leads to notable differences: RCA typically exhibits higher water absorption and a lower specific gravity compared to natural aggregate [25]. Specifically, the presence of adherent mortar and brick content in RCA results in a relative density reduction of $5 \mathrm { - } 1 0 \%$ [25]. Studies evaluating RCA for road sub-base applications have shown that increasing the percentage of RCA content correlates with an increase in water absorption (from $1 . 5 8 \%$ for $0 \%$ RA to $4 . 6 5 \%$ for $1 0 0 \%$ RA), necessitating greater water requirements in mixes [22]. Furthermore, the mechanical durability indicators,  

including crushing value, impact value, and abrasion value, tend to increase with higher proportions of recycled aggregates [22]. The abrasion loss of RCA is generally higher than that of virgin aggregates [25].  

Beyond RCA, other alternative aggregates are characterized based on their source material. Fine by-products from the quarry and ornamental stone industries, such as marble dust, granite dust, and limestone dust, are characterized by their chemical compositions and size grading [28]. Different alternative materials possess distinct inherent properties; for instance, carbide slag (CS) has a specific gravity of 3.66, notably higher than that of natural sand at 2.64 [14].  

A significant challenge associated with the use of alternative aggregates, particularly RCA, is the inherent variability and heterogeneity of their characteristics [18]. This variability is largely dependent on the source of the concrete and the processing techniques employed [18]. Factors such as the amount of adherent mortar, presence of contaminants like masonry or asphalt, and the efficiency of the crushing and sorting processes contribute to inconsistencies in particle shape, grading, specific gravity, and absorption [18,25]. Ensuring consistent quality requires adherence to specific standards, such as BS 8500-2 (2006) and the Australian Standard HB 155 (2002), which set limits on contaminants like masonry, fines, lightweight material, asphalt, foreign material, and acid-soluble sulfate for RCA used in concrete [25]. Furthermore, recycled aggregate may be low in fines, potentially requiring manipulation of grading or the addition of binders to achieve effective compaction [25].​  

Several key properties profoundly influence the performance of construction materials made with alternative aggregates. For concrete applications, the aggregate content, along with particle shape and grading, significantly affects the bulk void content and the fresh and hardened properties of the concrete [30]. The surface texture of fine aggregates also plays a role in these properties [30]. As demonstrated, water absorption impacts the water demand of the mix, influencing workability and potentially strength [22]. Mechanical properties such as crushing value, impact value, and abrasion value are critical for assessing the aggregate's resistance to degradation under stress [22]. For fine by-products, chemical composition and size grading are essential parameters dictating their reactivity and filler potential in various applications [28]. Comprehensive characterization of these properties is therefore vital for predicting material performance and developing appropriate mix designs.​  

# 4.3 Performance of Concrete and Other Materials with Alternative Aggregates  

The incorporation of alternative aggregates, particularly recycled concrete aggregate (RCA), into concrete and other construction materials has been extensively studied to evaluate their performance characteristics. Research indicates that RCA can be successfully utilized in various applications, including aggregate for Portland cement concrete [25]. A continuous reinforced concrete pavement constructed using $1 0 0 \%$ recycled coarse and fine aggregate demonstrated good performance, albeit with observed ettringite formation [25].  

The performance of concrete incorporating RCA is influenced by several factors, notably the proportion and type of RCA used. In fresh concrete, increasing RCA content typically leads to decreased workability, increased water demand, higher entrapped air content, and poorer finishability [25]. For hardened concrete, the inclusion of RCA generally affects mechanical and durability properties. Compressive strength can decrease by 5 to $2 5 \%$ when coarse RCA is used, and by 15 to $4 0 \%$ when both coarse and fine RCA are incorporated [25]. Flexural strength is also negatively impacted, particularly with the use of fine RCA [25]. Durability aspects such as chloride resistance, gas permeability, water sorptivity, and freeze-thaw resistance are generally adversely affected by increased quantities of RCA [25]. Furthermore, concrete containing RCA exhibits higher creep and shrinkage, which correlates with the paste or mortar content present in the RCA [25]. Despite these potential drawbacks, some reports suggest that concrete with RCA performs equally to concrete with natural aggregates in new concrete applications [30], highlighting variability likely linked to RCA quality, mix design, and application. Standard guidelines permit the use of RCA at $2 0 \%$ of coarse aggregate in designated concrete classes RC20/25 to RC40/50, and without general restrictions on proportion in classes GEN0 to GEN3, provided aggregate durability criteria are met [25]. Class 1A-RCA is suitable for replacing up to $3 0 \%$ of natural aggregate in concrete for sidewalks, kerbs, gutters, and structural concrete with mix adjustments, although this may result in inferior permeability and shrinkage [25].  

Alternative aggregates derived from construction and demolition waste (CDW) have shown promise for specific applications like road sub-bases. Studies suggest that replacing up to $5 0 \%$ of fresh aggregates with CDW can yield mixes suitable for road sub-bases, meeting permissible limits set by standards such as those from the Indian Road Congress (IRC) and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH), while allowing for effective compaction [22]. High-quality recycled aggregate products are being considered for road and civil projects [5]. Recycled concrete aggregates also demonstrate potential for use in asphalt mixtures, with many studies indicating compliance with quality requirements, particularly for low-volume roads [18].  

Other alternative materials present unique performance considerations. High quantities of fine wastes from the quarry and ornamental stone industries can lead to high water demand, substantial drying shrinkage, and detrimental effects on physical and mechanical properties of concrete and cement-based products [28]. Carbonated aggregates, produced via exsitucarbon mineralization, represent a potential new type of aggregate for construction that could reduce net CO2 emissions if economically viable [23].  

The synergistic effects and potential of combining supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) with alternative aggregates are crucial for improving durability, performance, and extending service life, thereby reducing environmental impact. While alternative aggregates like RCA can introduce challenges such as increased shrinkage and reduced durability, optimizing the binder composition, including SCMs like fly ash or using ternary blended cements, can help mitigate these issues and enhance overall concrete performance. For instance, recycled aggregate concrete with strength characteristics suitable for structural members can achieve lower carbon emissions than conventional concrete, with the influence of cement and fly ash being relevant factors in their life cycle assessment [4]. The use of ternary blended cements and locally available industrial waste in the binder has shown notable environmental benefits in higher strength concrete classes [7]. When incorporating alternative aggregates like copper slag (CS) as a sand replacement, the binder plays a critical role in achieving desired performance. Substitution of up to $4 0 { - } 5 0 \%$ CS can result in comparable compressive, tensile, and flexural strengths to $1 0 0 \%$ sand mixtures, along with significantly improved workability. However, higher replacement rates (exceeding $6 0 \%$ ) lead to considerable reductions in compressive strength [14].​  

# 5. Comparative Analysis: LCA of Virgin vs. Alternative Aggregates and Case Studies  

Comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies provide essential insights into the environmental performance of alternative aggregates relative to traditional virgin aggregates [2,4,7,14]. An analysis of findings across multiple studies reveals significant variability in environmental impacts, depending on the type of alternative material and the specific impact categories assessed [2,4,5,14]. While some alternative aggregates, such as certain recycled concrete and crushed stone substitutions, demonstrate substantially lower environmental burdens across metrics like Global Warming Potential and embodied energy [5,13,14,15], others, such as sintered flyash aggregate, may exhibit higher impacts compared to natural aggregates [2].​  

The relative environmental performance of virgin and alternative aggregates is highly sensitive to a range of influencing factors [4,21]. Key determinants include transportation distances for both aggregates and supplementary cementitious materials, energy consumption and the source of energy used in material production and processing, and the specific composition and quantity of materials utilized in the final application, such as binder type and replacement rates [2,4,7,14,16,21]. These factors can lead to conflicting results across studies, highlighting the critical role of defined system boundaries, data sources, and methodological choices in LCA outcomes [21]. Understanding these sensitivities is crucial for identifying the specific conditions under which alternative aggregates offer genuine environmental advantages.  

Practical application through case studies provides tangible examples of alternative aggregate utilization and the associated environmental benefits [1,5]. Initiatives demonstrating the successful diversion of construction and demolition waste into certified recycled aggregate products showcase quantifiable reductions in waste sent to landfill and improvements in carbon footprint [5,25]. These case studies underscore the importance of local resource availability, transportation logistics, and industry collaboration in realizing the potential environmental gains of using alternative materials [21]. By comparing and analyzing these LCA findings and case studies, this section aims to synthesize the current understanding of the environmental trade-offs between virgin and alternative aggregates, identify key influencing parameters, and highlight successful strategies for implementing more sustainable aggregate use [1,4,5].

Life Cycle Assessment studies provide critical insights into the environmental performance of alternative aggregates compared to traditional virgin aggregates across various impact categories. A direct comparison based on available LCA results demonstrates significant variability in performance depending on the type of alternative material and the specific environmental metric considered. For instance, certain recycled materials exhibit substantially lower environmental burdens. Greenstone, a certified recycled aggregate, has been reported to possess a carbon footprint as low as $5 \%$ of that associated with virgin aggregate production, indicating a considerable reduction in Global Warming Potential (GWP) [5].​  

Similarly, substituting natural sand with crushed stone (CS) in concrete mixes can lead to notable reductions in environmental impacts. Replacing $4 0 \%$ of natural sand with CS (Mix 3) resulted in impact reductions ranging from $8 \%$ for embodied energy, acidification, POFP, and PM formation to $12 \%$ for GWP. Increasing the replacement level to $1 0 0 \%$ CS (Mix 6) further reduced these impacts significantly, ranging from $3 0 \%$ for GWP to $4 1 \%$ for acidification and embodied energy [14]. However, when normalizing impacts with respect to compressive strength, the environmental performance remained nearly similar for mixes containing up to $6 0 \%$ CS replacement compared to those using $1 0 0 \%$ natural sand [14].  

Research into upcycling plastic waste through cold sintering also suggests substantial potential for reducing environmental impacts across key categories [13,15], aligning with findings on the lower energy use $( 4 . 1 - 8 . 6 \mathsf { M J / k g } )$ and GHG emissions $( 0 . 2 8 - 0 . 5 3 \mathsf { k g } \mathsf { C O 2 } / \mathsf { k g } )$ of mechanical plastic recycling compared to other methods.  

In contrast, not all alternative aggregates demonstrate environmental superiority over natural aggregates. Sintered flyash aggregate (SFA), for example, shows significantly higher environmental impacts during production than natural aggregate (NA). The production impacts of SFA are reported to be between $5 5 \%$ and $9 0 \%$ higher than those of NA across various categories. Specifically, the GWP associated with 1 tonne of SFA production is $8 3 \%$ higher than that of 1.5 tonnes of NA. Acidification potential and eutrophication potential for SFA are $5 5 \%$ and $9 0 \%$ higher than NA, respectively [2]. This highlights that the environmental benefits of using alternative aggregates are not universal and depend heavily on the material type and its production process.​  

Furthermore, the context of application and the inclusion of all life cycle stages significantly influence the comparative results. Analysis of external wall systems indicated that systems utilizing materials like concrete more intensely (e.g., Insulating Concrete Forms – ICFs) exhibited higher environmental impacts in most impact categories during the construction phase compared to systems like Light Steel Frame Systems (LSFS), where LSFS only showed a higher impact in ozone depletion [21]. This underscores that the environmental burden is driven by overall material usage, not just the aggregate type in isolation [21]. Overall, building construction tends to have the most severe impacts on energy use, global warming, and acidification potential [16].​  

Crucially, studies comparing recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) with natural aggregate concrete (NAC) reveal that recycled aggregates may not always be environmentally superior to virgin aggregates under certain conditions, particularly when considering specific system boundaries and material compositions [4]. Natural aggregate concrete produced with cement only typically results in carbon emissions between 323 and 332 kgCO2e per cubic meter [4]. Replacing natural coarse aggregates with $5 0 \%$ and $1 0 0 \%$ recycled aggregates can lead to an increasein carbon emissions if the analysis excludes the transportation phase, which is often a significant contributor to the impact of alternative materials [4]. However, the magnitude of this increase is relatively small for $5 0 \%$ recycled aggregate replacement, resulting in only a $0 . 3 \%$ increase for normal strength concrete and a $3 . 4 \%$ increase for high strength concrete in such scenarios [4]. The composition of the binder also plays a critical role. Incorporating supplementary cementitious materials, such as fly ash, significantly reduces the environmental burden. Replacing $2 5 \%$ of cement with fly ash in NAC can reduce carbon emissions by up to $1 7 \%$ [4]. Furthermore, concrete mixes combining $1 0 0 \%$ recycled aggregates with $2 5 \%$ fly ash have been shown to achieve lower carbon emissions than concrete made solely with cement and natural aggregates, demonstrating that strategic material combinations can enhance the environmental performance of RAC [4,7].​  

# 5.2 Factors Influencing Relative Performance  

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) results and the perceived environmental superiority of different aggregate types, including virgin aggregates and those incorporating supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) or recycled content, are significantly influenced by a variety of factors. Key determinants include transportation distances, the energy consumption associated with processing and material production, and the specific type and quantity of materials utilized [21]. The selection of materials and their geographical sources play a crucial role in defining the overall environmental footprint [21].  

Transportation distance is a critical factor with substantial impact on overall environmental burdens, particularly carbon emissions, for both aggregates and SCMs. Studies indicate that transportation distances of fly ash are a pivotal factor influencing environmental benefits [4]. Achieving higher environmental benefits from using fly ash is contingent on relatively short transportation distances, optimally within $1 5 - 2 5 k m$ , in conjunction with a cement replacement rate of $2 5 \%$ or higher [4]. Similarly, the use of locally available industrial waste in blended cements improves environmental performance, primarily by reducing transportation burdens [7]. Conversely, excessive transportation distances, such as overseas shipping, can become a major source of environmental impact, potentially negating the environmental  

advantages of alternative materials [14]. The transportation stage can contribute significantly to certain impact categories, such as ozone depletion potential, due to fuel consumption like diesel [16].  

Beyond transportation, the energy consumption during material production and processing significantly shapes LCA outcomes. The material production stage often constitutes the largest portion of a building's total environmental footprint, ranging from $8 8 \%$ to $9 7 \%$ across different impact categories [16]. For specific materials, such as sintered fly ash aggregate, heat consumption during the sintering process and electricity consumption in various unit operations are identified as key contributors to environmental impacts [2]. While processing aggregates, including the replacement of natural sand with alternative materials, may require comparable amounts of energy, subtle differences in energy consumption profiles can still influence comparative environmental impacts [14]. Therefore, the sensitivity of comparative results to variations in processing energy or the carbon intensity of local energy grids is considerable, as processes heavily reliant on electricity or heat will reflect the environmental burden of their energy source. Other factors, such as the specific type and quantity of materials used [21], the variability in Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data for materials from different sources [7], and the specific technological pathways employed (e.g., process parameters like temperature, pressure, or catalysts in certain reactions [13,15,23]) can also markedly influence the relative environmental performance evaluated through LCA.​  

# 5.3 Case Studies and Practical Applications  

Real-world case studies provide valuable insights into the environmental performance of both virgin and alternative aggregates, illustrating practical applications and outcomes of sustainability initiatives. A notable example is the application of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) in construction projects in Dublin, Ireland [5]. Shannon Valley Group, a construction company, actively diverts waste concrete from multiple projects to IMS for recycling [5]. This waste concrete is processed into “Greenstone”, a certified recycled aggregate product [5]. The practical outcome of this collaboration is the successful diversion of waste from landfill, which helps “close the loop” in the construction material lifecycle [5]. Furthermore, utilizing Greenstone demonstrably improves the carbon footprint of construction companies, contributing to their ability to achieve sustainability certifications such as LEED or BREEAM [5].  

Complementing direct material application cases, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies applied to construction systems offer a different perspective on practical environmental evaluation [21]. For instance, an LCA study comparing external wall systems for residential units in Al-Ain, UAE, serves as a practical application of this methodology [21]. While this study compares entire systems rather than focusing exclusively on aggregate types, it underscores a critical factor for practical decision-making: the importance of considering the local context [21]. Factors such as the availability of local resources and expertise significantly influence the sustainability outcomes of different construction methods [21].​  

Comparing these case study approaches reveals distinct focuses. The Dublin example highlights the direct implementation pathway for alternative aggregates, demonstrating tangible benefits like waste reduction and carbon footprint improvement derived from specific industry collaborations and material streams [5]. It presents a clear trend towards utilizing construction and demolition waste for circular economy principles in the aggregates sector. In contrast, the UAE LCA study represents a methodical evaluationframework, emphasizing that environmental performance is not universally applicable but is heavily dependent on regional variables and resource specifics [21].  

The implications for practical decision-making are significant. The success demonstrated in Dublin reinforces the environmental and commercial advantages of integrating certified recycled aggregates into construction projects, providing empirical evidence for their role in achieving sustainability goals and relevant certifications [5]. Simultaneously, the findings from the UAE case study serve as a crucial reminder that environmental assessments and material selections must be context-aware [21]. Relying solely on generalized data may lead to suboptimal environmental outcomes. Therefore, practitioners should prioritize understanding the local availability of virgin and alternative aggregates, transportation impacts, and regional expertise when making material choices to ensure accurate environmental performance predictions and truly sustainable construction practices [21].  

# 6. Economic Considerations and Life Cycle Cost Analysis  

The utilization of alternative aggregates presents a compelling economic case, particularly when considering direct costs and potential savings compared to virgin materials. Research indicates that using demolished waste materials for road subbase construction can lead to reduced costs [22]. Similarly, incorporating recycled aggregates in concrete production aims to decrease overall production costs, encompassing material, energy, and economic factors [30]. These findings suggest that alternative aggregates can offer immediate cost advantages in specific applications like road construction and concrete production. However, the economic viability can vary depending on the specific application, regional factors (such as transportation costs and availability of waste streams), and required processing of the alternative materials. Comparisons of alternative materials, such as insulated concrete form (ICF) exterior walls versus conventional wood frames, reveal that while initial construction costs for some alternatives might be higher, the overall economic picture necessitates a broader perspective [21].​  

Evaluating the long-term economic benefits of sustainable materials, such as alternative aggregates, requires a comprehensive approach that extends beyond initial capital expenditure. Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) provides a structured framework for this evaluation by considering all costs incurred over the entire life cycle of an infrastructure project or material usage. LCCA encompasses initial costs, maintenance expenses, repair costs, operational costs, and endof-life costs (e.g., disposal or recycling). This perspective is crucial for understanding the true economic value of sustainable materials, as potential savings from reduced waste disposal or extended service life due to material properties can offset higher initial processing costs. Academic considerations in fields like concrete structures emphasize evaluating costs throughout the entire life cycle to enhance sustainability [34]. While specific case studies detailing the comprehensive application of LCCA to alternative aggregate projects were not extensively available within the provided digests, the principle of accounting for all life cycle phases is fundamental to demonstrating the potential long-term economic advantages of these materials. By applying LCCA, researchers and practitioners can highlight how investments in alternative aggregates, potentially involving higher upfront costs for collection and processing, can lead to overall economic benefits through reduced material consumption, lower disposal fees, and potentially improved durability or performance contributing to lower maintenance costs over the project's lifespan.​  

# 7. Policy and Regulatory Frameworks  

Government policies and regulatory frameworks play a pivotal role in steering the construction industry towards more sustainable practices, particularly in the realm of aggregate management and the adoption of alternative materials [8,12]. A global trend is the establishment of national net-zero emission targets, often supported by comprehensive roadmaps that integrate circular economy principles [24]. These high-level commitments translate into specific regulations and incentives designed to reduce reliance on virgin resources and promote material reuse.​

Diverse approaches are observed across different regions and countries, reflecting varied policy priorities and contexts. In the UAE, the emirate of Abu Dhabi has implemented a long-term plan requiring new construction to comply with Estidama requirements, a building rating system akin to LEED, thereby mandating a level of sustainability performance that influences material choices [21]. Singapore has taken a proactive stance by its Building and Construction Authority (BCA) promoting and approving the use of alternative materials like washed copper slag (CS) to replace sand in concrete. Policies allow for partial replacement and extend to permitting $1 0 0 \%$ CS use in non-structural concrete without special approval. Furthermore, Green Mark points, a form of certification incentive, are awarded for recycling washed CS from approved sources for use in main building elements [14].​  

In contrast, several countries have focused on integrating recycled materials into public works specifications. The United States, for instance, sees all 50 state Departments of Transportation permitting the use of Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) in highway construction [25]. Similarly, the transportation department in the United Kingdom has incorporated the application of recycled concrete into the specifications for highway works, while Japan has established regulations specifically promoting the utilization of reused concrete for development purposes [22]. These examples highlight how procurement policies, linked to technical standards and specifications, can directly create a market for alternative aggregates in large-scale infrastructure projects.​  

Certifications and regulatory decisions play a crucial role in validating alternative aggregates and facilitating their market acceptance. The End of Waste Decision process, as exemplified by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) granting the first such decision to IMS in 2019, is instrumental in diverting construction waste from landfill and enabling its use as certified secondary aggregate [5]. This regulatory mechanism provides clarity and confidence regarding the status and quality of recycled materials.  

Beyond technical standards and certifications, financial incentives and broader regulatory frameworks are being employe Many nations are introducing incentives such as tax breaks for companies adopting sustainable sourcing practices or implementing Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes that shift responsibility for end-of-life management to manufacturers [24]. While not specific to aggregates, policies like the European Environmental Agency’s "ammonia Adoption Act" illustrate how financial incentives and regulatory support can accelerate transitions towards cleaner processes [24]. Cross-border collaborations and initiatives like the Circular Economy 100 (CE100) also contribute by facilitating knowledge exchange and promoting collaborative policy-making, helping to disseminate best practices internationally [24].​  

Despite advancements, challenges remain. Traceable sourcing, particularly in sand and gravel mining, lacks reliable, scalable monitoring methods beyond self-reporting and direct observation, posing a hurdle for effective policy enforcement aimed at reducing unsustainable extraction [3]. Furthermore, international frameworks, such as the International Seabed Authority (ISA) drafting regulations under UNCLOS concerning deep seabed mining, touch upon resource management and revenue sharing but highlight the ongoing development of governance structures for novel aggregate sources [17].  

In summary, policies promoting sustainable aggregate management encompass diverse instruments, including mandated sustainability ratings [21], material-specific approvals and certifications [5,14], integration into technical specifications and procurement policies [22,25], and broader incentives like tax breaks and EPR schemes [24]. While these frameworks are driving the transition towards a circular aggregate industry by creating regulatory certainty and market demand for alternative materials, challenges in monitoring and the need for further international coordination persist.  

# 8. Challenges and Opportunities for Sustainable Aggregate Use  

Advancing the sustainable use of aggregates is critical for reducing the environmental footprint of construction and resource extraction. However, the transition from virgin to alternative aggregate sources is hindered by a complex interplay of technical, regulatory, economic, and data‐related challenges, while simultaneously presenting significant opportunities driven by technological innovation and improved practices. Addressing these barriers and capitalizing on opportunities requires a concerted effort across the value chain.  

A primary technical challenge lies in ensuring the consistent quality and predictable performance of alternative aggregates [25,30]. Unlike standardized virgin materials, the characteristics of alternative aggregates, particularly those derived from recycled sources like construction and demolition (C&D) waste or industrial by‐products, are highly variable [18,30]. For instance, the properties of recycled aggregates are strongly influenced by their parent concrete’s composition and processing methods, affecting crucial concrete characteristics such as durability, permeability, and strength [25,30]. Recycled concrete aggregates, for example, typically exhibit lower density, higher porosity, and increased water absorption compared to virgin aggregates, along with the presence of microcracks in residual mortar and at interfacial transition zones [25]. Furthermore, residual contaminants such as plastic or wood can introduce variability [25]. These inconsistencies lead to limited knowledge regarding the long‐term performance of materials incorporating alternative aggregates, particularly under traffic loading, which introduces unpredictability in service life predictions [22]. Therefore, rigorous experimental testing is necessary for concrete mixes incorporating recycled aggregates to determine their specific characteristics [30] and the durability of materials made from recycled sources warrants thorough investigation before widespread application in engineering projects [1]. Challenges also extend to specialized areas like carbon mineralization using waste byproducts, where issues such as passivation of reactive surfaces and clogging of pore space can decrease permeability in in situ systems [23], and managing complex waste streams like plastic composites which pose difficulties for traditional mechanical recycling [13,15].  

Regulatory and policy frameworks often lag behind technological potential, creating significant barriers to the broader adoption of alternative aggregates. A lack of clear standards and specifications tailored for these materials complicates their acceptance and integration into construction projects [25,30]. Furthermore, insufficient local recycling infrastructure, as observed in the disparity between EU average recycling rates and those in specific member states like Ireland for C&D waste, hinders the efficient processing and supply of recycled aggregates [5]. Policies are needed to promote local industry development and knowledge transfer in green building practices, reducing reliance on overseas expertise and resources which can stifle local opportunities [21]. Issues of transparency, such as those highlighted in deep seabed mining processes, also underscore the need for robust regulatory oversight and prioritization of environmental protection to prevent irreversible impacts and biodiversity loss [17].​  

Economic barriers and market acceptance issues also impede the uptake of sustainable aggregates. Recycling and processing alternative materials can involve significant costs, exacerbated by a lack of operational infrastructure [11]. Broader economic barriers affect the implementation of sustainable concrete construction practices generally [12]. For instance, Ex‐situ carbon mineralization faces high costs, raising questions about the logistics and expense of handling, transportation, and disposal of the resulting materials [23]. To overcome market reluctance, it is crucial to enhance the attractiveness of mixes utilizing alternative aggregates by optimizing their performance and reducing dependency on conventional materials [7]. Promoting the use of demonstration projects and educational initiatives can help build confidence and acceptance within the construction industry.​  

Despite these challenges, numerous opportunities exist for advancing sustainable aggregate use, often driven by technological advancements and improved material utilization strategies. Under‐utilised waste streams, such as quarry dust, represent a significant resource that could yield economic and environmental benefits through technically and economically feasible processing technologies [28]. Similarly, marble and granite residues can serve as partial replacements for cement, offering substantial environmental gains including reduced $C O _ { 2 }$ ​ emissions [28]. The recycling of washed spent catalyst (CS) as a sand substitute addresses sand shortages and eliminates disposal issues, presenting a potentially sustainable solution [14]. Technological improvements in the production of alternative materials, such as using biomass based fuels and grid electricity for sintered fly ash aggregate production, can reduce environmental impacts, making them comparable to natural aggregates [2]. Innovative approaches like cold sintering offer alternative methods for upcycling waste plastics into high‐performance composites, overcoming limitations of traditional recycling [13]. Furthermore, utilizing waste byproducts for carbon mineralization presents an opportunity to mitigate hazards associated with alkaline industrial wastes [23]. Strategic actions such as working with design partners and supply chains to select efficient, low‐ carbon solutions can significantly reduce embodied carbon in construction [8]. The integration of ecosystem services into material selection processes offers potential for positive changes in the environmental impact of building materials throughout their lifecycle [6]. Technological advancements like machine learning analysis of satellite imagery present opportunities to improve the tracking of resource extraction activities, such as sand mining, which currently suffers from a lack of reporting systems [3].  

Finally, the development of robust life cycle assessments (LCAs) and effective decision‐making frameworks for sustainable aggregate use is hampered by the need for improved data availability and quality. Significant variability in life cycle inventory (LCI) data for recycled aggregates necessitates the use of data ranges in the absence of specific information, impacting the reliability of LCA results [7]. Furthermore, accurately quantifying resource extraction volumes, such as natural bedload fluxes and extracted tonnage in sand mining, is challenging due to insufficient reporting systems and informal mining activities [3]. A better understanding and integration of the impacts of materials on ecosystem services are also crucial for informed decision‐making [6]. Addressing these data gaps is essential for providing credible environmental and economic assessments that can support the wider adoption of sustainable aggregate practices.​  

# 9. Synergistic Decarbonization Efforts in Energy and Transportation Sectors  

Reducing the environmental footprint, particularly the embodied carbon, of both virgin and alternative aggregates is critically dependent on decarbonization efforts within the energy and transportation sectors. The carbon intensity of the energy supply used for extraction, processing, and transportation machinery fundamentally influences the overall life cycle emissions of aggregate materials. A transition towards renewable energy sources for powering these operations, coupled with electrification in transportation, offers a significant pathway for reducing embodied carbon [26].  

Studies indicate that switching to a fully renewable energy grid can substantially decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy use, and water consumption associated with industrial processes relevant to aggregates [15,31]. Scenarios analyzing high renewable energy penetration, such as utilizing $1 0 0 \%$ solar power for electricity consumption, demonstrate clear potential for carbon footprint reduction compared to fossil fuel-based or grid mixes [2]. While electrification offers zeroemission potential at the point of use, it concurrently increases electricity demand, making the carbon intensity of the power sector paramount to realizing overall emission reductions [26].  

Complementary to energy transition, the application of carbon capture technologies presents another crucial strategy for mitigating emissions within the aggregate and associated construction material value chain. While aggregate production primarily involves energy-related emissions, process emissions, particularly from cement production used with aggregates in concrete, are substantial. Carbon capture technologies, including capturing $C O _ { 2 }$ from industrial sources or directly from the atmosphere (DAC), offer methods to abate these emissions [31]. Innovative applications like carbon curing in concrete production sequester $C O _ { 2 }$ within the material matrix, improving properties and offering significant emission reduction potential [1].​  

The integration of large-scale renewable power with carbon capture and storage/utilization (CCS/CCUS), bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and DAC is seen as essential for developing a cleaner energy supply that further supports emission reductions in energy-intensive aggregate processes [26]. Evaluating the technical and economic feasibility of carbon capture integration, considering costs and environmental trade-offs, is vital [31]. Integrating these technologies, potentially including those highlighted for the road sector like carbon sink applications [19], into aggregate production and concrete processes contributes directly to the goal of low-carbon construction [12].  

Achieving carbon neutrality in the aggregate industry necessitates exploring scenarios that synergistically combine energy system decarbonization with the strategic deployment of carbon capture technologies.  

# 9.1 Impact of Electrification and Renewable Energy  

The transition towards electrification and the increased adoption of renewable energy sources hold significant potential for reducing the environmental footprint—particularly the carbon emissions associated with industrial processes such as aggregate production. Traditionally, aggregate operations rely heavily on fossil fuel-powered equipment and energyintensive processes. Electrifying these operations allows for the decoupling of energy consumption from direct fossil fuel combustion at the point of use; however, the overall environmental benefit is intrinsically linked to the carbon intensity of the electricity supply.​  

![](images/92cbd16537812be6435e1c9dc0b60053a3cd33fe6f2673419de4b3d0f177c195.jpg)  

Studies exploring the impact of energy source on industrial processes highlight the considerable reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy use, and water consumption achievable by switching to a fully renewable grid compared to conventional energy mixes [15,31]. Specifically, within the context of aggregate production, evaluating scenarios with high renewable energy penetration demonstrates a clear pathway for carbon footprint reduction. For instance, research evaluating sintered flyash aggregate production explored scenarios utilizing $1 0 0 \%$ solar power for electricity consumption [2]. This analysis contrasted the environmental performance against scenarios powered by electricity from coal-based thermal power plants (or the general grid mix) and scenarios using biomass-based OFF gas [2]. Such comparisons underscore the dramatic difference in embodied carbon intensity depending on whether the electricity originates from fossil fuels or renewable resources.​  

While electrification offers the benefit of potentially zero-emission operation at the point of use, it also leads to a substantial increase in electricity demand. For example, in the transport sector, electrification is projected to cause a significant increase in electricity demand—ranging from 5.1 to 6.7 times that of previous levels [26]. This increased demand places pressure on the power generation infrastructure, and the ultimate impact on emissions is critically dependent on the carbon intensity of the power sector [26]. Therefore, achieving significant carbon footprint reductions in the aggregate industry through electrification necessitates a parallel transition to a low-carbon or predominantly renewable electricity grid. Scenarios comparing embodied carbon intensity under current, often fossil-fuel-heavy, energy mixes versus those with high renewable energy penetration reveal that the full environmental benefits of electrifying aggregate production equipment are only realized when powered by clean electricity. This highlights that electrification is a necessary but not sufficient condition for decarbonization; the source of electricity is paramount in determining the overall emission reduction potential.  

# 9.2 The Role of Carbon Capture Technologies  

The mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions within the construction materials sector, particularly concerning virgin aggregates and associated concrete production, necessitates exploring advanced abatement technologies such as carbon capture.

While aggregate extraction and processing primarily involve energy consumption and land-use change impacts, cement production (a key component of concrete using aggregates) is a significant source of direct process $C O _ { 2 }$ emissions. Carbon capture technologies offer pathways to reduce emissions either by capturing $C O _ { 2 }$ from industrial sources or directly from the atmosphere.  

One transformative approach directly applicable to concrete production is carbon curing, which utilizes $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ instead of traditional water-based methods to cure concrete [1]. This process facilitates the formation of calcium carbonates, thereby sequestering $C O _ { 2 }$ within the concrete matrix [1]. For concrete formulations incorporating recycled materials, carbon curing not only enhances carbon sequestration but also improves essential properties such as strength and durability [1]. Technical evaluations indicate that carbon curing has the potential to reduce $C O _ { 2 }$ emissions by up to $3 0 \%$ per cubic meter of concrete produced [1], demonstrating significant technical potential for emission reduction within the concrete production phase of the supply chain.  

Beyond direct application in processes like curing, broader carbon capture technologies such as Direct Air Capture (DAC) are being explored [31]. While DAC captures $C O _ { 2 }$ directly from the atmosphere, its application in the aggregate and concrete supply chain could involve providing a source of captured $C O _ { 2 }$ for processes like carbon curing or potentially offsetting emissions through carbon removals. Furthermore, the integration of large-scale renewable power with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS), and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), alongside DAC, is recognized as a strategy for developing a cleaner, low‐carbon electricity supply [26]. A cleaner energy mix is crucial for reducing indirect emissions associated with energy‐intensive processes in aggregate extraction, crushing, screening, and concrete mixing.  

Evaluating the technical potential reveals that methods like carbon curing offer a direct, quantifiable reduction in concrete's carbon footprint through sequestration and process modification [1]. The economic potential of such technologies is linked not only to carbon credit markets or emission reduction mandates but also to potential improvements in material performance (e.g., enhanced strength from carbon curing), which could lead to cost savings or enable new applications [1]. However, the economic viability of broader CCS/CCUS/DAC deployment for emission sources in the aggregate/concrete lifecycle depends heavily on technology costs, energy requirements, $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ transport and storage infrastructure, and policy incentives.​  

Integrating these technologies into existing aggregate and concrete supply chains presents both opportunities and challenges. Carbon curing represents an opportunity for relatively direct integration into concrete batching plants, requiring modifications to curing processes but leveraging existing infrastructure for concrete production [1]. Challenges include sourcing and handling the required $\mathsf { C O } _ { \mathsf { z } }$ . For aggregate processing facilities and potentially cement plants, integrating post‐ combustion capture (a form of CCS not detailed in the digests but relevant) or utilizing DAC would require significant capital investment, energy penalties, and integration with existing flue gas streams or direct air contact systems. Opportunities lie in creating new revenue streams through $C O _ { 2 }$ utilization (e.g., in carbon curing or other industrial processes) and enhancing the sustainability profile of construction materials, which is increasingly demanded by markets and regulations. However, the infrastructure requirements for $C O _ { 2 }$ capture, transport, and storage/utilization remain a significant technical and economic hurdle for large‐scale deployment across dispersed aggregate and concrete facilities.​

Future research in the field of aggregate sustainability necessitates a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach, integrating environmental, economic, social, and performance considerations. Such integrated analyses are crucial for moving towards Sustainable Development Goals [11]. Specifically, research should focus on enhancing multi-criteria decision-making processes that incorporate environmental (LCA), economic (LCC), and social (S-LCA) dimensions of clean technologies and materials [11]. Integrating an understanding of ecosystem services into the selection and utilization of materials within the built environment is also identified as a critical area for future study [6].  

Significant knowledge gaps remain concerning the assessment methodologies for aggregate sustainability, particularly within Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Methodological developments are required to refine LCA approaches, including the implementation of ex-ante LCA and upscaling models tailored for emerging technologies [11]. Furthermore, LCA methodologies should be refined to better account for the inherent variability in the properties of recycled aggregates and the long-term performance characteristics of materials incorporating these aggregates [7]. Extending analytical frameworks, such as multiplicative structural decomposition analysis, to encompass a broader range of energy and environmental indicators related to consumption-side intensities is also suggested for future research [10]. A fundamental challenge lies in improving data availability and quality for LCA studies. This includes the systematic development and collection of robust inventory data for innovative technologies, as well as comprehensive data on mining, refining, and material processing activities, alongside current and innovative recycling processes and the characteristics of recycled and recyclable materials [11]. Enhanced resolution in data, such as utilizing more detailed sector and product classifications, can provide deeper insights into the environmental footprint of specific consumer products [27]. For natural aggregates, future research must focus on improving the characterization of seafloor sand deposits and enhancing the understanding of marine coarse sediment transport dynamics [3]. Establishing coherent deep ocean observation systems is also highlighted as essential for informing environmental protection strategies [17].​  

The increasing demand for aggregates and the depletion of natural sources necessitate exploring new sources and applications for alternative aggregates [30]. Future research should investigate processing methods and expand the studied properties of quarry dust, ornamental stone fine by-products, and stone slurry to identify their potential applications in various construction contexts [28]. Improving the properties of recycled aggregates is vital for their wider adoption [25], particularly through further investigation into density improvement techniques involving chemicals and reactions, which have been only superficially studied to date [25]. Specific research projects could include exploring the application of cold sintering technology for upcycling diverse plastic waste streams and inorganic materials into composites suitable for construction, alongside evaluating sintered flyash aggregate under various conditions to determine its environmental competitiveness compared to natural aggregate [2,13]. Detailed studies are also needed on the use of recycled concrete aggregates in asphalt mixtures [18] and their application as road sub-base materials [22]. Crucially, research must address the long-term durability and performance of structures incorporating alternative aggregates, such as cold-sintered composites and recycled aggregates used in roads and concrete [7,13,22].​  

Effective policies are critical for driving the transition towards sustainable practices in the aggregate sector. Research is needed to assess the effectiveness of policies designed to stimulate investments in cleaner technologies and recycling [11]. Investigations into the barriers and challenges hindering the widespread adoption of green buildings, potentially through targeted surveys of industry stakeholders, are also proposed [21]. Research should also explore policy mechanisms, such as mandating minimum required shares of recycled aggregate in construction projects like roads, to promote circular economy principles [22]. Furthermore, assessing future demand for minerals essential for the transition to a low-carbon economy and examining the role of regulatory bodies in enforcing environmental impact assessments are important policy-related research areas [17]. Enhancing the utility of environmental indicators, such as biodiversity significance, for policy and local decision-making is also crucial [20].  

Emerging technologies hold significant potential for transforming the aggregate and construction sectors. Future research should focus on assessing the potential of technologies such as digitalization, data-driven approaches, and circular economy principles to drive sustainable concrete construction [12]. Specific technological areas requiring further investigation include carbon capture and storage, carbon sink technologies, and the application of hydrogen, solar, and photovoltaic energy sources in the road sector for emission reduction [19]. Research is also needed on advanced technologies and alternative materials/fuels for concrete production [14], closed-loop recycling technologies for materials like polyolefins [15], and the mechanisms driving carbon mineralization reactions for $C O _ { 2 }$ storage in minerals and geological formations [23]. Exploring alternative fuels and energy sources for high-temperature processes like sintering is also pertinent [2]. Research into product design that enhances the sustainability and lifespan of future technologies can contribute to reduced demand for virgin resources [17]. Finally, developing improved methods for traceable sourcing, potentially utilizing techniques like sand provenance analysis in supply networks, is an important area for technological development [3].​  

# 11. Conclusion  

The environmental impact of virgin aggregate extraction and processing presents a significant challenge to achieving sustainability within the construction sector. As highlighted throughout this survey, activities such as sand and gravel mining and potential deep-sea mining carry substantial environmental burdens, including habitat disruption, biodiversity loss, and resource depletion [3,17]. The material production stage, which heavily relies on aggregates, is consistently identified as a primary contributor to the environmental footprint of construction projects [16].  

In addressing these impacts, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) emerges as an invaluable tool for informed decision-making [11]. LCA provides a comprehensive framework to quantify the environmental performance of materials and processes across their entire life cycle, from extraction to disposal or recycling [11]. Studies applying LCA have illuminated the environmental hotspots in construction, such as the material usage in building systems [21] and the significant contribution of material production and construction phases to road sector emissions [19]. LCA methodologies, such as cradle-to-site analysis, can serve as templates for evaluating building projects [16], and the scope of LCA studies on embodied energy and emissions in aggregates has expanded from national to global and sub-national levels, indicating growing recognition of its importance [10].​  

Alternative aggregates offer a promising pathway towards mitigating the environmental burdens of virgin materials. Recycling of demolished concrete into aggregates is particularly beneficial, preserving natural resources, reducing was generation, and conserving landfill space [25]. The use of recycled cement and aggregates can substantially reduce concrete's carbon footprint, by an estimated $5 0 \% - 6 0 \%$ , underscoring their role in sustainable construction practices [1]. Recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) have demonstrated potential for incorporation into asphalt mixtures, often meeting required quality standards, particularly for low-volume roads [18]. Furthermore, construction and demolition waste can be effectively utilized as road sub-base material, demonstrating environmental benefits through reduced reliance on virgin aggregate sources and decreased associated pollution from manufacturing and transportation [22]. Recycled aggregate concrete, when possessing adequate strength characteristics, can yield lower carbon emissions compared to conventional concrete, aligning with global sustainability standards [4]. Beyond C&D waste, other alternative materials like copper slag have shown potential as partial replacements for natural sand, maintaining comparable environmental impacts and mechanical properties up to a certain percentage [14]. Waste materials from the quarry and ornamental stone industries also present potential for use in construction applications, although specific technical requirements must be met [28]. The development of circular concrete mixes incorporating recycled concrete powder and waste perlite powder further exemplifies the potential for material circularity and climate change impact reduction [7]. Innovative approaches like cold sintering even allow for the upcycling of plastic waste into construction-relevant composites with reduced environmental impacts [13].​  

Despite the significant benefits, challenges remain in the widespread adoption of alternative aggregates. Comprehensive investigation into the properties and characteristics of recycled aggregates is still needed to ensure their reliable performance in diverse construction applications [30]. The production processes for some alternatives, such as sintered fly ash aggregate, may initially present higher environmental impacts compared to natural aggregates, necessitating optimization, potentially through the integration of renewable energy sources [2]. Furthermore, the technical specifications for incorporating fine wastes from industries require careful consideration [28]. Beyond technical hurdles, successful adoption is also contingent upon addressing economic and social factors, such as the logistics of material sourcing and the availability of expertise [21].​  

Achieving a more environmentally responsible construction sector necessitates a concerted and collaborative approach involving all stakeholders. Researchers, policymakers, industry professionals, and the public must work together to promote responsible aggregate management [3]. This includes advancing research into alternative materials and processes, establishing clear specifications and standards, implementing effective policies that incentivize the use of recycled materials and integrated resource management strategies, and promoting recycling through education and information campaigns [12,22]. Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial to address the complexity of transitioning to sustainable practices [12]. The shift towards a circular economy, integrating principles of net zero emissions, is fundamentally reshaping the global sustainability landscape and is exemplified by initiatives like certified recycled aggregates with Environmental Product Declarations [5,24].​  

Ultimately, the transition to alternative aggregates encompasses environmental benefits, economic viability, and societal acceptance. It requires a fundamental shift in how resources are perceived and managed, moving towards a model that minimizes extraction and maximizes the use of secondary materials. This paradigm shift aligns with broader sustainability goals, including the protection of natural systems and biodiversity through considering land use impacts and integrating ecosystem services into material selection [6,17,27]. By embracing LCA and fostering collaboration, the industry can navigate the complexities and capitalize on the opportunities presented by alternative aggregates, paving the way for a truly sustainable built environment that contributes to global carbon reduction targets [4,8].​
