# 1. Introduction  

Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly transitioned from a domain of theoretical exploration to a pervasive force reshaping global economies and societies [22,29,31]. At the heart of this transformation lies AI automation, a broad concept encompassing the application of AI technologies—including Robotic Process Automation (RPA), AI-driven tools, generative AI (GenAI), and large language models (LLMs)—to automate tasks, optimize processes, and create new forms of value [12,37]. Unlike previous forms of automation, AI, particularly generative AI built upon complex foundation models, possesses the capability to process vast amounts of unstructured data, understand multiple information modalities, and generate novel outputs, significantly enhancing its potential to accelerate task automation and drive productivity gains across diverse sectors [4,36,41]. This evolution signifies a shift from merely automating routine tasks to augmenting and ultimately achieving autonomy in complex operations, positioning AI as a new, fundamental factor of production with the potential to unlock unprecedented economic progress [20,21,43].​  

The economic implications of AI are projected to be substantial and far-reaching.

Global forecasts indicate a dramatic increase in economic activity attributable to AI in the coming decade. PwC estimates that AI could contribute between ​15trillionand 15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, potentially increasing global GDP by up to $1 4 \%$ [10,20,25]. This figure is cited as exceeding the combined economic output of China and India in 2016 [25]. Similarly, IDC projects that AI will contribute ​19.9trilliontotheglobaleconomyby2030, accountingf or3.5 2.6 trillion to ​4.4trillionbasedonusecaseanalysis[4]topotentialcontributionsequivalentto"aUK sGDP "annually[2, 8, 40].McKinseyresearchsuggestsGenAIcouldcontribute 7.9 trillion to the global economy [11,15,24], and could ultimately increase global annual GDP by $7 \%$ over the next decade [15,36]. These projections highlight AI's potential to significantly accelerate economic growth, potentially doubling annual growth rates in developed economies by 2035 according to Accenture [21]. Investment in AI is also seeing a boom, attracting significant attention, particularly since the advent of advanced models like ChatGPT, though challenges in achieving profitability remain [1,44].​  

The impact is particularly pronounced in major economies like China, which is rapidly emerging as a global leader in AI innovation through substantial investment and strategic initiatives like the $" \mathsf { A l } + "$ approach integrating AI across industries [3,34,45]. China is expected to realize significant economic gains from AI; PwC estimates that China and North America combined could account for nearly $7 0 \%$ of the global economic impact by 2030, totaling   
​10.7trillion[10].McKinseyestimatesgenerativeAIalonecouldcontribute 2 trillion to the Chinese economy by 2030 [28]. Furthermore, analysis suggests AI could boost China's GDP by $9 . 8 \%$ by 2035 compared to a baseline, adding 0.8 percentage points to the annual growth rate over the next decade, with accelerated generative AI adoption potentially increasing GDP by 0.2–0.3 percentage points by 2030 compared to earlier forecasts [3,7].​  

Despite the optimistic projections regarding economic growth and productivity gains, the rise of AI automation presents considerable challenges and concerns [5,11,19]. A primary concern is the potential for widespread job displacement as AI automates tasks, with estimates suggesting hundreds of millions of jobs worldwide could be at risk [36]. While history shows that technological advancements can also create new jobs, the scale and speed of AI-driven automation necessitate significant workforce transformation and retraining efforts [2,8,14,23,36]. Furthermore, AI introduces risks related to data security, privacy, intellectual property, reliability, and ethical considerations [11,23,33,40]. There are also challenges in  

effectively scaling AI applications within enterprises and ensuring the equitable distribution of AI's economic benefits across countries, companies, and individuals, potentially widening existing inequalities [12,13,42]. The actual capabilities and adoption timelines of advanced AI technologies, particularly generative AI, also remain subjects of uncertainty [36].  

This survey aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of AI automation's potential for explosive economic growth, synthesizing diverse perspectives and quantitative forecasts presented in the literature [19,22]. It seeks to compare and contrast findings regarding AI's economic impact, explore the mechanisms through which AI drives growth, and examine the significant challenges and opportunities across various sectors and regions, with a particular focus on the interplay between global trends and China's strategic advancements. By analyzing the methodologies employed in economic forecasting and identifying key knowledge gaps such as strategies for successful implementation, sustainable business models, skill development, and effective governance, this survey contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the AI-driven economic transformation [8,9,26,32,36,42,44]. Acknowledging the inherent uncertainties and limitations in current predictive models and available data, the survey synthesizes findings to highlight robust trends and critical areas for future research and policy intervention. The subsequent sections will delve deeper into the technological underpinnings of AI automation, the specific pathways through which it impacts economic growth, its differential effects across industries and the labor market, the critical challenges and risks, and the policy considerations necessary to harness AI's potential while mitigating its downsides.​

![](images/8d96539def3b009b2c11fed85d43fd0857ab22e72cb40f571c238e7551ef0fae.jpg)  

The technological landscape of AI automation is undergoing a dynamic evolution, fundamentally reshaping business processes and economic potential [11]. This transformation is driven by advancements in core AI disciplines such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision (CV), which form the bedrock for increasingly sophisticated automation solutions [11,13,22]. These foundational technologies enable advanced data analysis, prediction, image interpretation, and language processing, supporting diverse applications from automated quality control in manufacturing to intelligent customer service and scientific research [5,39,42,43].  

A significant trend involves the integration of these AI capabilities with established automation paradigms like Robotic Process Automation (RPA). While traditional RPA focuses on automating structured, repetitive tasks, the fusion with AI gives rise to enhanced solutions such as Intelligent Document Processing (IDP), which leverages computer vision, NLP, and machine learning to handle unstructured data and complex workflows [12,37]. Furthermore, technologies like process mining, task mining, and communication mining are gaining prominence for understanding and optimizing enterprise operations [37].​  

The emergence and rapid growth of Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) since approximately 2020 represent a pivotal development, dramatically expanding the scope of AI automation to include complex cognitive tasks previously requiring human expertise [4,12,16,37]. Built upon advanced deep learning architectures like the Transformer model, these models enable the generation of novel content across various modalities, including text, images, audio, and video, and facilitate intuitive interaction through natural language interfaces [4,27,36]. The integration of LLMs and GenAI into enterprise software is leading to the development of "co-pilot" virtual assistants that enhance user productivity and creativity, lowering the threshold for tasks such as coding, content creation, and design [2,12,42]. This wave of technology is characterized by significant investment and innovation from leading global and domestic tech companies [27,34,36].  

Beyond these specific technologies, the landscape is shaped by broader trends including the increasing integration of AI into end-user devices like AI PCs and AI phones, the development of AI agents capable of autonomous interaction, and the adoption of hybrid AI models combining public and private resources [11,15,17,18,34]. The democratization of AI through more accessible platforms and the underlying advancements in hardware, particularly AI chips and cloud infrastructure, are critical enablers of this expansion [15,22,35].​  

This technological progression positions AI as a General Purpose Technology (GPT), akin to historical innovations like electricity and the internet, due to its pervasive applicability and potential to drive sustained innovation and economic growth across diverse sectors [3,16,17,29,43]. While AI's current universal applicability defines its GPT status, the long-term pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), aiming for human-level cognitive abilities, represents an emerging frontier, distinct from the present-day concept of AI as a universal tool [3,27]. The development trajectory of advanced AI systems is significantly influenced by scaling laws, which demonstrate the performance gains achievable by increasing model size, albeit with substantial implications for computational resources and development costs, linking technological feasibility to economic considerations [3].​  

Future subsections will delve deeper into specific technologies such as Generative AI, LLMs, RPA, IDP, and process/task mining, providing detailed descriptions and applications. Market forecast data will be presented to illustrate the significant growth potential of these technologies [9,27]. A comparative analysis will be conducted between traditional automation and AI-enhanced automation, highlighting the shift towards reduced complexity and required expertise enabled by AI [37]. The chronological evolution of AI technologies will be traced, showcasing key milestones and shifts [20,27]. An analysis of successes and failures in AI automation implementations, focusing on contributing technical factors, will provide practical insights. The current penetration rate of AI across different sectors from a technological standpoint will be assessed, alongside a discussion of critical barriers to wider adoption, such as data availability, quality, and technical complexity [3]. Finally, the capabilities of AI will be further contrasted with human intelligence, and the concepts of GPT and AGI will be elaborated upon, clarifying their significance, progress, and associated uncertainties [3,36].

The current landscape of AI automation is characterized by the continuous evolution and integration of core technologies, transitioning from traditional rule-based automation to more intelligent and cognitive capabilities. Foundational AI disciplines such as machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision (CV) continue to advance, serving as the bedrock for increasingly sophisticated applications [5,11,22,29]. Machine learning is leveraged for data analysis and prediction across sectors like finance and healthcare [5,14,45], while computer vision is applied in areas ranging from automated manufacturing quality control, such as PCB fault detection, to scientific research like astronomical data analysis and autonomous vehicles [39,43,45]. NLP is integral to applications like intelligent customer service and healthcare solutions [5,42,45].  

A significant trend involves the integration of these AI technologies with robotic process automation (RPA). While traditional RPA excels at automating structured, repetitive tasks, its capabilities are expanding into desktop automation and backend support [12,37]. The growing demand is for AI-integrated applications that deliver enhanced business value [37]. Technologies like Intelligent Document Processing (IDP), which combines computer vision, NLP, and machine learning, exemplify this integration, significantly enhancing efficiency and reducing costs in document-intensive industries [12,37]. Process mining, task mining, and communication mining are also gaining prominence, enabling better understanding and optimization of business workflows [37].  

The rise of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) represents a pivotal development, fundamentally altering the scope and nature of AI automation and user interaction [4,12,16,37]. GenAI technologies, particularly those centered around large models, have seen rapid innovation and explosive growth since approximately 2020 [4,27]. LLMs empower applications to understand and generate human-like natural language, while multimodal AI-powered LLMs extend this capability to process and generate content across diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and video [4,27,34].  

The integration of LLMs and GenAI into enterprise software is a key trend, leading to the emergence of "co-pilot" virtual assistants that enhance user experience and productivity [2,12,17]. These technologies enable more intelligent automation by automating complex cognitive tasks, such as document processing, data extraction, writing code, content creation, and creative design, thereby reducing the need for specialized expertise and lowering the threshold for creative work [2,12,14,38,42]. Examples abound, from generative design tools that rapidly produce multiple schemes, improving work efficiency in design industries, to AI painting tools that simplify artistic creation through keyword inputs [38]. AI-assisted programming tools in software engineering also demonstrate the efficiency gains [42].​  

Leading global tech companies such as OpenAI (GPT-4), Anthropic ("Claude"), and Google (PaLM 2, Search Generative Experience) are at the forefront of LLM and GenAI development, demonstrating rapid improvements in capabilities [4,27,36]. Chinese tech giants including Alibaba (Qwen), Baidu (Ernie Bot), Tencent, iFlytek (SparkDesk), and Huawei (Pangu) are also actively developing powerful domestic LLMs [27,28,34]. Specific instances highlight the capabilities and adoption rates: iFlytek's SparkDesk 4.0 Turbo has demonstrated strong performance in mathematical and coding tasks compared to GPT-4o [34], Baidu's Ernie Bot has reached a large user base and handles substantial daily API calls, indicating significant integration and usage volume [34], and ChatGPT rapidly gained a massive user base, underscoring the user-friendliness and perceived value of these technologies [36].  

Beyond specific technologies, key trends include the increasing integration of AI into end-user devices like AI PCs and AI phones [11,15,17,18], the rise of AI agent technology designed for intelligent interaction with environments to achieve specific goals [34], and the emergence of hybrid AI models combining public and private large models for tailored enterprise solutions [18]. Furthermore, the democratization of AI through low-code platforms and cloud-based solutions is making AI technologies more accessible [35]. Underlying these advancements are critical hardware developments, with significant investment in AI chips (GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs), data centers, and cloud computing infrastructure [22,44].  

Comparing these technologies reveals a spectrum of capabilities and applications. RPA and IDP address specific automation needs for structured and document-centric tasks, respectively [12,37]. ML and DL provide analytical and predictive power across diverse data types [11,14]. CV enables machines to "see" and interpret visual data, while NLP allows them to understand and process language [11,42]. GenAI and LLMs, building upon these foundations (particularly DL and NLP), introduce powerful generative capabilities, enabling content creation, complex problem-solving through natural language interfaces, and multi-modal interaction [4,34]. The synergy between these distinct technologies, such as integrating LLMs  

with RPA to handle unstructured data or using computer vision alongside generative models for visual content analysis and generation, is driving more comprehensive and intelligent automation solutions across sectors like e-commerce, media, entertainment, gaming, healthcare, finance, and manufacturing [5,24,43,45]. While quantifying productivity gains precisely across all applications is challenging from the provided digests, the widespread adoption, integration trends, and specific examples like improved efficiency in document processing, accelerated design workflows, and enhanced code generation strongly indicate significant productivity benefits driven by these evolving core AI technologies.  

# 2.2 AI as a General Purpose Technology (GPT) and the Pursuit of AGI  

Artificial intelligence is widely characterized as a General Purpose Technology (GPT), a classification shared with transformative historical innovations such as the steam engine, electricity, computers, and the internet [1,3,16,17,29]. This designation stems from AI's broad applicability across diverse fields and economic activities, positioning it as a fundamental force of production capable of driving profound economic growth and societal transformation [3,19,29,32,43]. The characteristic "通用" (universality) inherent in AI emphasizes its widespread deployability rather than the emulation of human cognitive capabilities, distinguishing the concept of AI as a GPT from the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) [3].​  

Similar to prior GPTs, AI possesses the potential to generate sustained innovation and accelerate technological advancement across numerous sectors [4,19,43]. By enhancing productivity on the production side and stimulating new demands for intelligent products and services on the consumption side, AI is poised to revolutionize economic landscapes [16,18]. Its capacity for autonomous learning, rule identification, and judgment based on big data and advanced algorithms provides novel avenues for optimization, such as promoting energy efficiency and reducing consumption [32]. The development of AI as a GPT is not static but represents a dynamic process, intricately linked to the evolution of the digital economy and the synergy derived from integrating various technological tools [3].​  

While current AI systems exhibit characteristics of a GPT through their broad impact and transformative potential [3], the concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), aiming for intelligence comparable to human cognitive abilities, is recognized as an emerging direction [27]. The increasing accessibility and usability of current AI technologies imply a trajectory towards more advanced and intelligent systems over time [43]. The development path of AI, particularly advanced systems, is significantly influenced by scaling laws, which indicate that increasing model size leads to improved performance, albeit with substantial implications for required computational resources and development strategies [3]. While the digests acknowledge AGI as a future frontier, they provide limited specific details regarding the challenges and uncertainties surrounding its full realization. However, the distinction drawn between AI as a GPT, defined by universality, and AGI, potentially defined by human-level capabilities, highlights the evolutionary nature of AI development and its potential to further mature its role as a truly pervasive and transformative general-purpose technology [3].  

# 3. Economic Impact: Potential for Explosive Growth  

Artificial intelligence (AI) automation is widely anticipated to be a transformative force capable of driving explosive economic growth through multifaceted channels [14,21]. Projections from leading research institutions consistently highlight substantial potential contributions to global GDP and productivity in the coming decade. For instance, PwC estimates that AI could contribute up to   
​15.7trilliontotheglobaleconomyby2030, withsignif icantcontributionsf rombothincreasedproductivity( 6.6 trillion) and consumer-side effects (   
​9.1trillion)[10, 25].AnotherPwCanalysisfocusingonAIandroboticssuggestsasimilarpotential, contributingupto 15 trillion by 2030 [20]. IDC forecasts an even larger impact, projecting AI to contribute   
​19.9trilliontotheglobaleconomyby2030, boostingglobalGDP growthby3.5 13 trillion in additional economic activity globally by 2030, equivalent to $1 . 2 \%$ annual GDP growth, potentially accelerating in the years leading up to 2030 [5,13,14]. Goldman Sachs projects that widespread AI adoption could boost global annual GDP by $7 \%$ [11,36]. Estimates specifically for generative AI (GAI) suggest an annual global economic contribution of 2.6trillionto 4.4 trillion across studied use cases, potentially doubling when considering all applications, an amount roughly equivalent to the UK's GDP [2,4,8,27,40]. Some estimates for GAI reach $\$ 7-7.9$ trillion [15].​  

These varied projections, while uniformly optimistic about AI's potential, exhibit discrepancies in their quantitative forecasts. These differences arise from variations in underlying assumptions regarding the pace and depth of AI adoption, the scope of technologies included (e.g., general AI vs. generative AI), methodologies for quantifying impacts (e.g., inclusion of consumer demand effects), and regional factors affecting implementation [1,10,25,41]. For example, some reports emphasize productivity gains as the initial driver [10], while others factor in consumer demand stimulated by enhanced products [10,25]. The challenge of accurately measuring AI's impact, particularly the intangible benefits and complex interactions within the economy, contributes to these forecasting differences [1,4,26].

AI contributes to economic growth primarily through several key channels: significantly enhancing productivity and efficiency, driving innovation and the creation of new products and services, and enabling the emergence of novel business models [14,19,33,42].​  

Productivity gains and efficiency improvements are foundational to AI's economic impact. AI automation streamlines processes, automates routine tasks, and optimizes operations across diverse sectors [6,34,42]. This is achieved through applications like automated robots in manufacturing, AI-driven optimization of supply chains, and machine learning for enhanced data analysis [5,14,19,22,29]. Generative AI, in particular, has the potential to automate a substantial portion of daily work activities, especially in knowledge-based roles, serving as a primary driver of expected productivity boosts [7,28,40,41]. Quantitative evidence supports these claims, with academic research suggesting annual labor productivity gains of 2–3 percentage points for companies adopting AI [36]. Automation broadly is projected to contribute 0.2 to 3.3 percentage points to annual productivity growth [28]. Specific examples of efficiency gains include a $1 4 \%$ average increase (up to $3 5 \%$ for new staff) in customer service representative efficiency with GAI-based assistants [12], a $2 0 \%$ to $4 5 \%$ impact on software engineering expenditure [2,4,8], and a $1 0 \%$ to $1 5 \%$ productivity increase in product R&D with GAI [2]. Beyond GAI, examples include improved PCB manufacturing yield, reduced manual work through machine vision, and tenfold improvements in customs clearance efficiency via supply chain optimization [43]. These productivity gains are often coupled with significant cost reductions, such as potential savings of $3 0 \%$ to $4 5 \%$ in customer service and $2 0 \%$ to $4 5 \%$ in software engineering costs with GAI adoption [2,4,28]. However, accurately measuring AI's productivity impact, especially intangible benefits like improved customer satisfaction or enhanced employee engagement, remains a challenge [4,10,27,35,38].​  

AI automation is a powerful engine for innovation and the creation of new markets and business models [4,15,22,30,37]. AI accelerates product development and innovation cycles by enabling faster simulation, testing, and research, particularly in complex areas like drug discovery [4,42]. By automating routine tasks, AI frees up human capital for higher-value creative and strategic work [4].

However, the degree and nature of transformation vary. Industries heavily reliant on routine, data-driven tasks, like finance and administrative services, face higher risks of task automation but also stand to gain significantly from AI-driven efficiency and analytical improvements [20,36]. Sectors with substantial physical labor or those demanding high levels of human interaction and social skills, such as construction, maintenance, and potentially certain aspects of healthcare and education, may experience slower or different types of AI adoption, focusing more on assistance and augmentation rather than full substitution [20,36]. The rapid advancements in generative AI specifically promise disproportionately large impacts on sectors like banking, high-tech, and life sciences due to its capabilities in content generation, coding, and complex data analysis [2,4,8,24,40]. Furthermore, industry-specific factors like regulatory environments, data availability and privacy concerns, and the capital intensity of implementation significantly influence the pace and success of AI adoption.  

In essence, AI automation is not merely optimizing existing processes but fundamentally reshaping traditional business models across the economy, from smart factories in manufacturing to personalized medicine in healthcare and automated financial risk management [2,5,11,14,15,22,24,26,29,33,34,43,45]. This pervasive influence creates new opportunities for innovation, drives increased spending on AI solutions tailored for diverse clients, and underscores the broad transformative power of AI across the global economic landscape [16,18].  

# 4. AI Automation and Labor Market Transformation  

![](images/bef97f6eb0076461b085f3459914bb019b9c21c54f03ed4528f5e72d6831bd91.jpg)  

The pervasive advancement and adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) automation technologies are poised to fundamentally transform labor markets globally, presenting a complex interplay between potential job displacement and the creation of new employment opportunities [4,5,8,14,19,20,22,23,28,29,30,36]. This section analyzes this multifaceted impact, synthesizing different perspectives on the dynamics of job loss versus job gain, examining the evolution of required skillsets, and discussing the potential for AI to augment human capabilities.  

Quantitative projections of job displacement vary significantly across studies, reflecting differences in methodologies, scope, and underlying assumptions regarding technology adoption rates and capabilities. While earlier analyses often focused on the automation of repetitive, manual, and low-skill tasks prevalent in sectors like manufacturing and customer service, the emergence of generative AI suggests an accelerating impact on higher-skilled, knowledge-based occupations involving complex cognitive functions like decision-making and creative problem-solving [2,4,5,6,8,22,28]. Estimates of automatable work tasks and jobs at risk range widely, with some forecasts indicating substantial potential displacement percentages globally and in developed economies, though the actual net effect by specific future dates remains subject to considerable uncertainty and debate [2,4,8,20,36,37]. The potential impact also differs across demographic groups and regions, influenced by existing economic structures and workforce composition [7,20,40].  

Concurrently, AI is a catalyst for the creation of new jobs, particularly within the technology sector itself, such as roles in AI development, data science, and maintenance, as well as entirely novel positions like AI prompt engineers and AI ethicists [6,14,22,29,42]. Beyond direct job creation, AI is increasingly viewed as a tool for augmenting human capabilities, enhancing productivity, and improving job quality by automating routine tasks and providing advanced insights, thereby enabling workers to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their roles [6,8,10,35,36]. This paradigm shift necessitates a fundamental evolution in the required skillsets, moving towards a greater demand for advanced digital literacy, cognitive abilities (creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving), and interpersonal skills, alongside sector-specific AI proficiency [14,20,22,28,29,35].​  

Navigating these transitions requires significant investment in education, training, and lifelong learning initiatives to equip the workforce with the necessary skills and support individuals in adapting to changing job requirements or transitioning to new careers [2,4,5,8,20,23,27,42]. The potential for structural unemployment and exacerbation of income inequality between high-skilled and low-skilled workers highlights the urgency for proactive policy responses and collaboration among governments, businesses, and educational institutions to ensure an equitable and prosperous future in the age of AI automation [14,19,30]. This section will further elaborate on these dynamics, skill transformations, augmentation effects, and potential mitigation strategies.  

# 4.1 Job Displacement and Creation Dynamics  

The widespread adoption of AI automation technologies is anticipated to significantly reshape labor markets, leading to complex dynamics involving both job displacement and the creation of new roles. Quantitative forecasts regarding the scale of these changes vary across studies, reflecting differences in scope, methodology, and underlying assumptions. Some analyses estimate that a substantial portion of current work tasks could be automated. For instance, one assessment suggests that approximately $2 5 \%$ of work tasks in the US and Europe are potentially automatable by AI, with a global figure around $1 8 \%$ , and estimates placing $1 5 \mathrm { - } 3 5 \%$ of jobs at risk of automation [36].​  

This study utilizes data from the ${ \mathsf { O } } ^ { \star } { \mathsf { N E T } }$ database to evaluate the automatability of various job tasks [36], and assumes a larger impact on developed economies compared to emerging ones [36]. Another perspective indicates that while the initial wave of automation might result in a relatively low displacement rate of around $3 \%$ in the early 2020s, this figure is expected to increase as automation technologies mature [20]. Large language models (LLMs), in particular, are seen as capable of performing tasks currently undertaken by a significant percentage of the workforce [12].​  

The nature of the jobs most susceptible to displacement is also evolving with advancements in AI. While earlier automation primarily impacted roles involving repetitive tasks, manual labor, and low human interaction, such as those in manufacturing and customer service [5,6,22,43], generative AI is expected to have a pronounced effect on highly knowledgebased white-collar occupations [28]. This includes roles centered around decision-making, collaboration, and the application of expertise [2,40]. This potential for automation among knowledge workers suggests an acceleration in the pace of labor transformation, with tasks previously considered non-automatable potentially becoming so within the next two decades [28]. Automation adoption rates may also vary geographically, potentially occurring more rapidly in developed countries partly due to higher labor costs [2].​  

Simultaneously, AI automation is anticipated to drive the creation of new employment opportunities. These emerging roles are expected to be concentrated in areas such as AI development, deployment, and related fields, requiring advanced skills [22,43]. AI investments are projected to contribute positively to employment through the creation of new jobs, with one estimate suggesting an increase of approximately $5 \%$ by 2030, alongside a productivity effect potentially adding another $1 0 \%$ to employment [13]. This dynamic highlights the potential for a significant skills gap, necessitating substantial workforce transformation, including upskilling and reskilling initiatives, to equip workers with the competencies required for the newly created roles and the evolving nature of existing jobs [4].​  

The potential net impact on overall employment levels remains a subject of analysis with varying perspectives. While some forecasts indicate pressure on full-time employment demand and the potential for a slightly negative net impact by 2030 [13], others propose a multi-stage model where an initial period of job displacement is followed by long-term employment growth [7]. The overall net effect is likely to be a complex interplay between the scale of displacement, the rate of new job creation, and the success of workforce adaptation.  

Predicting the exact scale and nature of these job changes presents considerable challenges. The differing quantitative forecasts underscore the uncertainty inherent in projecting the future trajectory of technological development, adoption rates, and their multifaceted economic and social impacts. Factors such as the evolving capabilities of AI, variations in industry-specific automation potential, regional economic structures, and policy responses all contribute to the difficulty in generating precise long-term predictions. The acceleration of automation timelines observed in recent analyses further complicates forecasting [28].​

The increasing integration of AI automation into various sectors necessitates a critical examination of its ethical implications, particularly concerning decision‐making in sensitive domains. Research indicates that generative AI, while offering significant economic potential, carries risks such as the potential to inflict emotional harm, generate misunderstandings, obscure factual information, and even incite violence [2].  

Beyond the potential for harmful content, the deployment of AI technologies also introduces complex ethical challenges such as determining responsibility in cases involving autonomous systems, like accidents with autonomous vehicles [5], and concerns regarding intellectual property rights related to the data used for training AI models [40], exemplified by lawsuits alleging the unauthorized use of creators' data [44].  

A central challenge in AI ethics is the presence of biases within algorithms, often stemming from problematic data sources [44]. These algorithmic biases can result in discriminatory outcomes and unfairness [29,30], thereby perpetuating or exacerbating existing societal inequalities and discriminating against specific groups. Examples include potential biases in applications like virtual try‐on services due to limitations or inherent biases in the training data used [4], and biases in AI decision‐making processes resulting from flawed data and algorithms [5,30].  

Addressing these issues requires a concerted effort to promote fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI systems [11,44]. Strategies for mitigating data bias are crucial. Moreover, ensuring transparency in AI operations and establishing clear lines of accountability for AI‐driven decisions are vital [11,44]. Several studies underscore the importance of ethical AI implementation [35], advocating for responsible design and deployment strategies that prioritize trust and transparency to prevent such concerns [25]. This includes emphasizing data privacy and compliance with relevant regulations [43]. The integration of AI governance and control measures is deemed essential for mitigating potential risks and ensuring the responsible deployment of AI technologies [12]. Furthermore, maintaining human oversight, especially when implementing generative AI in critical functions like marketing, is highlighted as necessary for careful consideration of ethical implications [4]. The evaluation of ethical frameworks and guidelines is therefore of paramount importance for guiding the responsible development and deployment of AI, ensuring that its economic benefits are realized without compromising fundamental ethical principles.​  

# 5.2 Data Privacy and Security Risks  

The widespread deployment of AI automation introduces significant challenges regarding data privacy and security. A fundamental risk is the potential for misuse of AI technologies, which can directly threaten personal privacy and data security [29]. Specifically, the collection, storage, use, and transmission of personal data inherent in many AI applications may lead to risks such as privacy disclosure and data abuse [3,5]. Reports on generative AI also explicitly identify privacy and security as key risks associated with its adoption [40]. These concerns are particularly acute in sectors handling sensitive information, including finance, healthcare, and internet services [5], and can extend to consumer applications such as AI companionship products [31].​  

The challenges in protecting data are multifaceted. Risks include data breaches, unauthorized access, misuse of personal information, and sophisticated cyberattacks specifically targeting AI models [11]. AI systems themselves can be vulnerable to hacker attacks, potentially leading to serious consequences [30]. While AI can be a powerful tool for cybersecurity, assisting in the detection of potential issues, anomalies, and vulnerabilities in real time, it is also acknowledged that AI can act as an antagonist in data security and privacy if not used correctly [35]. This dual nature of AI necessitates careful consideration of its implementation in security measures.​  

Given these risks, the importance of implementing robust measures to safeguard sensitive information cannot be overstated, both to protect individuals and organizations and to maintain public trust in AI technologies. Technological solutions are emerging to address some of these challenges. For instance, Edge AI enables local, real-time data processing, offering a potential solution for latency, connectivity, and privacy concerns by minimizing the need to transfer sensitive data to centralized clouds [35]. Similarly, the trend towards hybrid AI, which balances public and private large models, is seen as a means to enhance privacy and data security in AI applications [18,30]. Beyond technology, ensuring user data is not misused and establishing clear mechanisms to protect data owners' rights are considered crucial.​  

Addressing these risks effectively also requires robust regulatory frameworks and industry standards. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), for example, is highlighted as a key regulation emphasizing data privacy [43]. Adherence to security certifications, such as PCI-DSS used by cloud service providers for AI services, further contributes to ensuring reliability and security [43]. The need for clear legal frameworks is emphasized as essential for responsible data handling practices. While some studies implicitly acknowledge these risks by stressing the need for responsible development and deployment of AI [4], explicit attention to and proactive mitigation of data privacy and security risks are paramount for fostering trust and enabling the sustainable growth of AI automation.​

Policymakers must consider how to ensure AI technology benefits a broader population and reduces inequality, potentially leveraging fiscal policy to promote equitable distribution of technological progress and improve social security systems [3,19,42]. This involves balancing economic efficiency with social equity, which can present political challenges in policy implementation. Furthermore, establishing global standards and norms for AI governance requires strengthening international cooperation and potentially establishing international institutional frameworks to regulate areas like data security and ensure responsible AI use globally [27,34]. Navigating the competitive landscape among nations, particularly between the US and China, adds complexity to achieving international consensus [14,16,18,27]. Ultimately, a successful policy approach necessitates collaboration among all stakeholders— companies, policymakers, consumers, and citizens—to maximize AI's value while mitigating its disruptive potential [2,8].  

# 6.1 Education, Training, and Workforce Development Policies  

Adapting to the transformative impact of AI automation necessitates a significant focus on education, training, and workforce development policies. Research underscores the critical role of preparing the labor force to collaborate effectively with AI systems and navigate changing career landscapes [35]. A key concern is the potential vulnerability of workers with lower educational attainment, who may face higher risks of displacement by automation in the long term [20]. This highlights the urgency for proactive interventions.  

To address these challenges, there is a consensus on the need to fundamentally redesign education systems and improve skill development methodologies [12]. Specifically, training programs must be developed that effectively bridge the gap between advanced AI technology and its practical applications in various sectors [43]. This implies a strategic imperative to foster interdisciplinary skills that enable workers to integrate human capabilities with AI functionalities [43].  

Achieving a smooth workforce transition requires substantial investment in upskilling and reskilling initiatives. Multiple sources advocate for dedicated investment from both government and businesses [5,35]. This investment is crucial for supporting workers in acquiring new competencies, facilitating career changes, and ensuring they are equipped for the demands of an AI-driven economy [4,35]. The explicit call for investment to enable workers to learn new skills and change careers emphasizes the proactive policy support needed to manage the societal impacts of automation [4]. While specific policy interventions like targeted investments in STEM or vocational training are not uniformly detailed across all digests, the overarching theme is clear: significant investment in human capital development is indispensable. The implementation of effective workforce development strategies inherently requires robust collaboration among government bodies, industry leaders, and educational institutions to align training outcomes with labor market needs and facilitate successful transitions.  

# 6.2 Regulatory and Governance Frameworks  

The rapid advancement and widespread deployment of AI necessitate the establishment of effective regulatory and governance frameworks to balance the immense potential for innovation with the imperative to protect individuals and society [4,27,30]. Such frameworks are crucial for managing the inherent risks associated with AI technologies and ensuring their responsible integration into economic and social structures [4,27].​  

Governmental intervention through relevant laws and regulations is essential to guide AI research and application [11,30]. Key areas requiring regulatory focus include ensuring the transparency of AI systems, upholding security standards, and, critically, protecting privacy [11]. Specific regulatory measures should prioritize safeguarding data privacy and guaranteeing robust data security protocols [5,43]. Furthermore, regulations must address the safety and compliance of AI models themselves [44]. Compliance with existing regulations, such as GDPR, is highlighted as crucial for addressing data privacy and security risks inherent in AI systems [43].  

Globally, significant progress is being made in establishing AI regulatory frameworks. Many countries recognize the importance of AI and have initiated national AI development strategies [3]. Notably, the European Union has pioneered the world's first comprehensive AI regulatory framework through the Artificial Intelligence Act [27]. This Act imposes stringent requirements on the development and application of General AI, aiming to cultivate a trustworthy technological environment and mitigate potential ethical concerns through provisions for transparency, privacy protection, and restrictions in high-risk sectors [27].

These initiatives reflect a growing international effort to create a regulated environment for AI.​  

Beyond governmental regulation, the importance of integrated AI governance within organizations is increasingly recognized. Survey data indicates a growing awareness among executives regarding the necessity of such frameworks, with approximately half reporting mature AI governance policies in place and a substantial proportion actively developing them [12]. This trend suggests a shift towards embedding responsible AI practices directly into corporate operations.  

# 6.3 Fostering Innovation and Investment  

Fostering innovation and investment within the artificial intelligence (AI) sector is fundamental to realizing its extensive economic potential [4]. Achieving this necessitates a concerted effort involving strategic policies, robust governmental support, and targeted capital deployment.  

Government plays a critical role in cultivating an environment conducive to AI innovation. This involves implementing public policies that establish a favorable macro environment, encompassing elements such as fostering strong consumer demand, ensuring thriving capital markets, developing effective digital economy governance mechanisms, and building essential public infrastructure [3]. For "catch-up innovation," often associated with large enterprises, long-term and stable financial support from entities like banks is crucial, leveraging their advantages in accumulating innovation factors such as intellectual property rights, human capital, and R&D investment [3]. Conversely, "leading innovation," which frequently originates from the experimentation and trial-and-error processes of numerous small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), benefits significantly from the capital market's capacity to effectively screen innovative technologies and business models [3,15]. The capital market's favorable disposition towards the AI field can specifically empower startups to deepen their specialization and drive further innovation [15].​

Thus, a comprehensive approach involving government policies, targeted investment in infrastructure and applications, and strategies to encourage business adoption is essential for unleashing AI's potential for explosive economic growth [39].​  

# 7. Conclusion  

This survey has explored the transformative potential of AI automation for driving significant economic growth, synthesizing insights from a range of academic papers and industry reports. A consistent theme across the literature is that AI serves as a core driver of global economic expansion [14], acting as a new factor of production capable of compensating for the diminishing returns from traditional inputs like capital and labor [21]. Studies project substantial future contributions to global GDP, with estimates ranging from ​15.7trillionby2030accordingtoPwC[23, 25]tonearly 20 trillion [17,18]. This growth is anticipated through AI's capacity to significantly enhance efficiency, reduce operational costs, foster novel business models, and revolutionize industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing [26]. Generative AI, in particular, is highlighted as having immense potential to disrupt labor markets, stimulate productivity growth, and add trillions of dollars to the global economy, potentially adding value comparable to an entire UK economy annually [4,36,40].  

Furthermore, AI is seen as instrumental in driving the digital economy, creating new opportunities across sectors, and even contributing to green economic growth through industrial structure optimization [15,32]. The fusion of automation and AI is poised to redefine enterprise value and operations [37], positioning AI as a fundamental engine for a new era of intelligence [24,29].​  

However, alongside this immense potential, the survey acknowledges the significant challenges and limitations associated with widespread AI implementation. Prominent concerns include potential labor market disruption and job displacement [4,5,44], the exacerbation of inequality [3,13,42], and complex ethical considerations [5,11,33,34,35,44]. Other challenges encompass data privacy and security issues [5,11,34], data acquisition costs [43], ensuring the authenticity and appropriateness of AI-generated content [38], challenges with profitability [44], and a shortage of requisite talent and skills [14,43]. Furthermore, the realization of AI's full economic benefits may not be immediate, requiring patience and strategic planning [13,41], and current investment trends suggest that adoption may be slower or less immediately impactful than some predictions [1].​  

Achieving a balanced perspective on AI's future role in shaping the global economy necessitates recognizing both its revolutionary potential and its inherent risks. The impact is expected to deepen with continuous technological advancements and broader applications [42], ushering in an era characterized by closer cooperation between humans and machines [29]. While generative AI may exert disinflationary pressures in the medium term, significant investments in AI infrastructure and development could concurrently increase demand and cost pressures [41]. A crucial aspect of adapting to this future involves focusing on augmenting human capabilities rather than merely fearing job replacement [6].​  

To maximize the benefits of AI while mitigating its negative impacts, proactive strategies and collaborative efforts are essential. For policymakers, this includes developing sound policy frameworks, regulations, and ethical guidelines [3,19,44], tailoring AI development policies to specific regional contexts, especially for green transitions [32], and systematically promoting development through cross-industry collaborative innovation and coordinated regional growth [27]. Policymakers and business leaders must engage in proactive preparation and strategic thinking to harness AI's potential [21]. Businesses are urged to continuously increase investment in AI R&D and leverage AI capabilities to drive growth and maintain competitiveness [16,17,18], adopt strategic partnerships early [10,35], prioritize responsible AI implementation and governance [22,33,37], and build trust and transparency in AI systems [10,25]. Both individuals and organizations must embrace AI and acquire relevant skills [14], with a particular emphasis on workforce development and skill adaptation to facilitate transitions to new roles [4,12,28]. Leaders, in particular, need to develop digital skills, understand digital business models, and foster a culture that embraces technological change [10,23].​  

Areas for future research and policy development remain critical. These include exploring the specific methodologies underpinning large-scale economic projections [25], investigating AI's long-term impacts and developing robust governance mechanisms [3], further understanding and leveraging AI's potential for sustainable development [32], identifying precise strategies to overcome barriers hindering generative AI adoption [9], and conducting detailed analyses of AI's sectorspecific, regional, and labor market impacts [6]. Ultimately, the uncertain nature of disruptive technological events underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI's evolving impact [6,23], necessitating flexible adaptation of policies and strategies to ensure AI serves as a powerful engine for sustainable global economic development that benefits society as a whole [8,19,42].
