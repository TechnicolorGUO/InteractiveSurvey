# 0. Statistical Testing for Explosive Financial Bubbles  

# 1. Introduction  

Identifying and understanding explosive financial bubbles is of paramount importance due to their profound and detrimental effects on economic stability [15]. Historical events demonstrate that asset price booms and subsequent busts can trigger significant declines in investment spending, reductions in business profits, increases in bankruptcies, and widespread unemployment, ultimately leading to economic downturns with severe consequences for livelihoods [1,2,4,6,10]. For instance, the bursting of the Dotcom bubble between 2000 and 2002 resulted in a nearly $8 0 \%$ loss in the NASDAQ's value and the destruction of over $\$ 7$ trillion in market value [2]. Similarly, large house price corrections have been shown to adversely affect economic performance and financial stability, as evidenced during the global financial crisis. Furthermore, the recurring inability of market participants to recognize the seriousness of a developing bubble, often driven by the conviction that "this time is different," underscores the need for objective identification methods [15].​  

Detecting these explosive bubbles presents considerable challenges. A primary difficulty lies in distinguishing genuine bubbles, characterized by self-reinforcing price increases unfounded in fundamentals, from periods of rational exuberance or fundamental-driven price growth [11,15]. Financial data is often characterized by significant noise, complicating the signal extraction process [12]. Moreover, the non-linear nature of bubble dynamics necessitates sophisticated models and tests that can capture their explosive behavior, which differs fundamentally from standard stationary or integrated processes [19]. A significant econometric challenge arises from the presence of serial correlation in high-frequency financial time series data, which can affect the accuracy of bubble detection tests and obscure the detection of multiple bubble episodes within the same sample period [7,8]. Additionally, spurious bubble detection can occur in the presence of deterministic trends if not properly accounted for by testing procedures [18]. The tendency for bubbles to occur simultaneously across multiple assets, driven by common latent factors, adds another layer of complexity, requiring methods capable of detecting such co-movements at an early stage [3,5].​  

Addressing these challenges necessitates the development and application of robust statistical testing frameworks [4]. Various methodologies have been proposed to identify periods of explosive dynamics in asset prices, ranging from modified unit root tests designed to capture explosiveness and multiple bubbles [7,8] to techniques accounting for deterministic trends [18] and approaches like quantile regression suitable for global testing and real-time monitoring [4]. Other innovative methods include those based on the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model [1], factor models for detecting common bubbles [3,5], real-time early warning systems [14], and AI-driven anomaly detection techniques [16].  

This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview and critical assessment of these statistical testing methodologies for identifying explosive financial bubbles. By exploring the theoretical underpinnings, practical applications, strengths, and limitations of different approaches, this survey seeks to synthesize the current state of research in this critical area. Highlighting the novel contributions and potential implications of research in statistical bubble detection, this work underscores the pivotal role that rigorous statistical frameworks play in enhancing financial market surveillance, informing policy responses, and ultimately mitigating the devastating economic consequences of bubble collapses [4,11].  

# 2. Theoretical Background and Definitions  

A financial bubble is broadly defined as a sustained increase in the price of an asset or asset class that is not justified by economic fundamentals [2,11,16]. The fundamental price of an asset is typically understood as the discounted present value of its expected future income stream or cash flows [2,11]. Bubbles represent a significant deviation from this fundamental value, driven by factors other than improvements in economic prospects or intrinsic worth [2,11,16]. This contrasts with rational market fluctuations, where price changes reflect new information about fundamentals, and with ordinary asset  

price appreciation driven by genuine economic growth. Ascertaining the existence of a bubble in practice remains a complex challenge [11].  

Traditional economic models, often rooted in rational expectations, typically posit that asset prices should reflect fundamental values in efficient markets. Deviations are generally viewed as temporary arbitrage opportunities that should be quickly corrected [2]. While some standard asset-pricing models allow for the theoretical possibility of "rational bubbles," where investors buy overpriced assets believing others will do the same, such models often struggle to explain the magnitude and dynamics of historical bubble episodes [11]. Their strength lies in providing a benchmark based on fundamental valuation, against which potential mispricing can be assessed. However, they often lack explanatory power for the psychological and social contagion aspects of bubble formation and collapse.

In contrast, behavioral finance theories emphasize the role of psychological factors, cognitive biases, and social interactions in driving asset prices away from fundamental values [2,13]. Key behavioral drivers identified include investor overoptimism, overconfidence, excessive speculation, and herd behavior (or "从众行为") [2,13,15,16]. The fear of missing out (FOMO) can also contribute significantly to bubble formation [13]. This perspective highlights an irrational mindset among market participants, characterized by a dismissal of historical lessons and a belief that "this time things are different," which suppresses critical evaluation of investment rationales [15]. Behavioral models are strong in explaining the momentum and positive feedback loops that characterize the expansion phase of bubbles and the panic selling during crashes, often incorporating elements like investor panic or herding to explain phenomena such as financial contagion [24]. Their weakness often lies in providing precise, testable predictions about the timing and specific trajectory of bubbles.​  

The mathematical underpinnings for statistically detecting bubbles often rely on modeling asset price dynamics using time series techniques, particularly autoregressive (AR) models and stochastic difference equations, which can exhibit explosive behavior under certain parameter configurations [18]. Explosive processes are characterized by a rapid, unsustainable rate of growth. The statistical properties of these models, such as the behavior of parameter estimators (e.g., the ordinary least squares estimator of the AR coefficient), are crucial for designing detection tests [18]. A necessary assumption for standard tests is often that the underlying data generating process can be adequately approximated by such models, although complications arise, for example, when deterministic trends are present, which can bias unit root tests and lead to false positives in bubble detection [18]. Some models incorporate mildly explosive factors specifically to capture the latent forces driving bubbles that exist only for subperiods [3].​  

Theoretical models underlying specific bubble detection tests can be broadly categorized based on their assumptions about bubble behavior. For instance, the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model is rooted in concepts of rational expectations but incorporates positive feedback from noise traders and boundedly rational agents, leading to superexponential price growth and periodic oscillations around this trend, culminating in a predicted finite-time crash [1]. This represents a model for periodically collapsing bubbles. Other tests might assume a continuous, albeit temporary, period of exuberance represented by explosive factors [3]. These theoretical differences significantly influence test design and  

interpretation. Tests based on detecting deviations from linearity or exponential growth (like LPPLS) differ from those based on identifying periods of statistical explosiveness in autoregressive specifications (like Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests). Understanding the assumed bubble generating process is thus critical for selecting and correctly interpreting the results of a statistical bubble detection test.  

# 3. Univariate Bubble Detection Tests  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Test</td><td>Basis</td><td>Bubble Application Concept</td><td>Key Limitations for Bubbles</td></tr><tr><td>ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller)</td><td>Unit Root Test</td><td>Adapted to test alternative of explosiveness</td><td>Spurious results with deterministic trends, Power compromised by serial correlation, Detects single episodes</td></tr><tr><td>PP (Phillips-Perron)</td><td>Unit Root Test (non- parametric correction for serial correlation)</td><td>Adapted to test alternative of explosiveness</td><td>Struggles with trends, Intermittent/collapsi ng bubbles</td></tr><tr><td>Variance Ratio</td><td>Deviations from Random Walk behavior</td><td>Variances growing faster than linearly signal positive feedback/explosiven ess</td><td>Primarily tests random walk properties, Less sensitive to specific bubble patterns/collapse phases</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Univariate time series tests form the basis for statistically identifying explosive behavior characteristic of financial bubbles. Foundational methods in this domain include the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and the Phillips-Perron (PP) test [19]. These tests, initially developed to assess the presence of a unit root or stationarity in a time series, are adapted for bubble detection by examining the alternative hypothesis of explosiveness rather than stationarity or a unit root.​  

However, applying standard unit root tests like ADF and PP to financial time series prone to bubbles presents significant challenges. A primary concern is their susceptibility to yielding spurious results in the presence of deterministic trends, potentially misidentifying trend-stationary processes as explosive [7,18]. While ADF and PP attempt to account for serial correlation, which is prevalent in financial data, their power can be compromised [8]. Furthermore, these early tests are generally designed to detect a single shift or unit root and lack the power to reliably identify or date the multiple, potentially periodically collapsing, bubble episodes often observed in real markets [8]. Variance Ratio tests, another class of early methods focusing on deviations from random walk behavior, offer a different perspective but are also limited in their ability to specifically target and detect the dynamic patterns of bubbles and their collapse phases.​  

The limitations of early unit root tests spurred the development of recursive right-tailed unit root tests, such as the Sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller (SADF) and Generalized Sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) tests. These tests employ a recursive framework, allowing them to continuously monitor for evolving explosivity and detect multiple bubble episodes within a single time series [6]. Their recursive structure supports real-time bubble detection, acting as an early warning system [14]. The GSADF test, in particular, enhances this capability through a double recursive regression model, enabling it to capture the maximum ADF value over all possible window start and end points, thus improving the detection of explosiveness even at the end of the sample [8,14]. The BSADF method is commonly used to generate the statistical sequence for these recursive tests [7,8]. These recursive methods have found practical application in identifying asset price booms, such as those in housing markets [6]. While powerful, practical challenges remain, including the determination of appropriate window sizes and critical values, though the provided digests do not detail specific strategies to address these.​  

Another significant advancement is the Phillips-Wu-Yu (PWY) methodology and its subsequent modifications, specifically designed to overcome the limitations of traditional methods in detecting multiple bubble episodes [7]. Modifications to the original PWY method primarily focus on robustly handling serial correlation, which can distort test statistics and critical values, leading to inaccurate bubble identification and dating [7,8]. These modified procedures utilize the BSADF statistic and simulations to derive appropriate critical values [7,8]. Empirical evidence suggests that modified PWY methods can detect bubble episodes missed by the traditional PWY approach, demonstrating improved performance in complex scenarios with multiple bubbles and serial correlation [7,8]. Comparisons with other advanced methods, such as the Phillips, Shi, and Yu (PSY) procedure, indicate that refined PWY-based techniques can offer more precise bubble termination dates in empirical applications [18]. However, a detailed, direct comparison highlighting the specific strengths and weaknesses of the original PWY test relative to standard ADF tests in the context of bubble detection is not available in the provided materials.​  

In summary, univariate bubble detection has evolved significantly from adapting general unit root tests like ADF and PP to developing methods specifically tailored for detecting the complex, often multiple and intermittent, nature of financial bubbles. Recursive tests like SADF and GSADF offer enhanced power and real-time capability by searching over expanding or rolling windows [6,14]. The PWY methodology, particularly its modified versions, provides improvements for detecting multiple bubble episodes and addressing issues like serial correlation [7,8]. While newer methods address key limitations of earlier ones, such as sensitivity to deterministic trends [18], serial correlation [7,8], and the inability to detect multiple bubbles [8], practical challenges remain, including parameter sensitivity and the derivation of appropriate critical values for recursive procedures.​  

# 3.1 Early Statistical Tests (ADF, PP, Variance Ratio)  

Early efforts in the statistical detection of explosive financial bubbles often relied on established time series methods, particularly tests designed to identify unit roots or assess stationarity. Among these, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and the Phillips-Perron (PP) test are foundational [19]. The standard ADF test, a significant development in unit root testing, is commonly employed in bubble detection [7,8]. These tests examine the properties of a time series to determine if it contains a unit root, which implies non-stationarity. In the context of bubble detection, the methodology is adapted; while standard unit root tests have a null hypothesis of a unit root against a stationary alternative, bubble testing often considers an alternative hypothesis of explosiveness, where the time series grows at an accelerating rate, exceeding the growth rate of a random walk or stationary process.​  

Despite their foundational role, these early unit root tests exhibit significant shortcomings when applied to the complex dynamics of financial bubbles. A core issue identified is the potential for misapplication in the presence of deterministic trends [7,18]. The standard ADF test, designed to test for a unit root, can yield biased results, specifically leaning towards rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., falsely indicating explosive behavior) when the underlying data is simply trend-stationary rather than genuinely explosive [7,18]. Furthermore, financial time series frequently exhibit serial correlation, which poses a challenge for tests like ADF [8]. While the ADF test attempts to account for serial correlation by including lagged differenced terms, its power can still be affected. The PP test, another early unit root test, addresses serial correlation differently by applying a non-parametric correction to the test statistics derived from a simple Dickey-Fuller regression. However, like ADF, it can struggle with accurately identifying true explosiveness, particularly in the face of trends or when bubbles are intermittent or periodically collapsing, characteristics common in real-world financial markets that these tests were not explicitly designed to capture [8].​  

Beyond unit root tests, Variance Ratio (VR) tests represent another class of early methods used to detect deviations from random walk behavior, which can be indicative of explosive dynamics. The VR test compares the variance of increments over different time horizons. For a random walk, the variance of increments is proportional to the time horizon. Departures from this proportionality, such as variances growing faster than linearly with the horizon, can signal positive feedback loops and potentially explosive price movements characteristic of bubbles. While VR tests offer a different perspective than unit root tests, focusing on the structure of volatility, they are also limited. They primarily test for random walk properties rather than directly testing for specific forms of explosiveness and can be less sensitive to specific bubble patterns or collapse phases compared to later methods designed explicitly for such phenomena.​  

In summary, ADF and PP tests served as initial tools by adapting unit root testing frameworks to the detection of potential explosiveness, while Variance Ratio tests offered an alternative by examining random walk properties. However, their basic principles and limitations mean they are often insufficient for reliably detecting and dating modern financial bubbles,  

particularly due to their sensitivity to deterministic trends [18], difficulties handling complex serial correlation patterns [8], and inability to effectively capture the intermittent and collapsing nature of many bubble episodes.  

# 3.2 Recursive Right-Tailed Unit Root Tests (SADF, GSADF)  

Recursive right-tailed unit root tests, notably the Sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller (SADF) and Generalized Sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) tests, constitute a prominent class of statistical methods designed for detecting explosive behavior in time series data, which is characteristic of financial bubbles. These tests represent an advancement over traditional unit root tests by employing a recursive framework that is specifically tailored to capture evolving explosivity and identify multiple bubble episodes within a time series [6]. This recursive structure enables the rejection of the null hypothesis of no bubble and provides evidence for both long and multiple periods of explosive behavior [6]. The technical implementation often involves using the BSADF method to obtain the statistical sequence for analysis [7,8]. Recursive tests have been applied to examine the degree and timing of asset price booms, such as those observed in housing markets [6,21].  

A key advantage of the recursive approach lies in its ability to facilitate real-time bubble detection and serve as an early warning system [14]. The recursive nature allows these tests to continuously monitor the data for emerging explosive patterns. Specifically, the GSADF test is particularly well-suited for real-time applications. Its underlying double recursive regression model calculates the BSADF value independently and repeatedly at each time point within the sample. This process ensures that the GSADF statistic always captures the maximum Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) value between the initial observation point and any subsequent observation, thereby enabling the effective identification of explosiveness even at the very end of the sample period [14].​  

Comparing the SADF and GSADF tests, the latter offers an important improvement by considering a wider range of potential bubble episodes. While SADF typically involves a forward expanding window starting from a fixed point or a minimum window size, GSADF extends this by examining all possible start and end dates for potential bubble periods within the sample constraints [8,14]. By calculating the supremum ADF statistic over all these windows, GSADF enhances the power to detect multiple bubble events and potentially pinpoint their initiation and termination more accurately [14].​  

However, the provided source material does not contain information concerning the challenges associated with determining appropriate window sizes or critical values for these tests, nor does it propose specific strategies for addressing these issues.​  

# 3.3 Phillips-Wu-Yu (PWY) Methodology and Modifications  

The Phillips-Wu-Yu (PWY) method represents a significant development in the statistical detection of explosive behavior characteristic of financial bubbles, particularly in addressing the challenge of identifying multiple bubble episodes within a single sample period. This approach offers advancements over traditional unit root tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, which are primarily designed to detect a single structural break or a transition from a unit root to stationarity, making them less adept at dating the inception and termination of multiple explosive periods [7].  

To enhance the robustness and efficacy of the PWY method, modifications have been proposed, primarily aimed at removing the influence of serial correlation [7]. Serial correlation can distort test statistics and critical values, potentially leading to incorrect inferences regarding the presence and timing of bubble episodes. The modified procedures leverage techniques such as the BSADF test statistic to construct a statistical sequence, with corresponding critical values typically derived through simulation methods to account for the time-varying nature of bubble dynamics and the impact of modifications [8]. These modifications are designed to improve the power and accuracy of the test in environments where serial correlation is present, thereby enhancing the reliability of bubble detection.​  

Empirical studies comparing the performance of the traditional PWY method with its modified counterparts have demonstrated notable improvements. Evidence suggests that the traditional PWY method may fail to detect all existing bubble episodes within a dataset [7]. In contrast, the modified PWY method has shown an increased capacity to identify bubbles that are not detected by the traditional approach, indicating its superior performance in complex scenarios, particularly those involving multiple bubbles and serial correlation [8].​  

Comparisons with other advanced bubble detection methods, such as the procedure developed by Phillips, Shi, and Yu (2015a, PSY), also highlight the contributions of refined PWY-based techniques. While a proposed new procedure might flag the same quantity of bubble episodes as the PSY method in empirical applications, such as with stock market data, it can yield estimated bubble termination dates that align more closely with observed market behavior [18]. This suggests that  

while different methods may agree on the overall number of explosive periods, refinements to the testing procedure, such as those applied to the PWY framework, can improve the precision of dating these episodes. The provided digests do not offer a direct, detailed comparison of the specific strengths and weaknesses between the original PWY test and standard ADF tests in the context of bubble detection.  

# 4. Multivariate and Panel Data Bubble Detection  

![](images/2e38b184755a267295c555c72d280d84d3193333fc8587040fb3e6d8f7e45cfa.jpg)  

The analysis of explosive financial bubbles has significantly advanced through the adoption of multivariate and panel data approaches, which offer distinct advantages over traditional univariate time series methods. These frameworks enhance statistical power by pooling information across multiple assets or markets, thereby increasing the precision of estimates and the ability to detect subtle bubble dynamics. Furthermore, multivariate models facilitate the control of unobserved heterogeneity, accounting for asset-specific characteristics or common factors that could otherwise obscure bubble signals. Crucially, these approaches enable the identification of common bubble components that may simultaneously affect numerous assets within a large financial system [5], as well as the understanding of transmission mechanisms and interdependencies.​  

Panel data approaches extend the methodology of univariate bubble detection tests, such as the Generalized Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) framework, to a multi-unit setting. This involves adapting recursive regression techniques to analyze explosive roots across panel members, either by aggregating statistics (pooled tests) or averaging unit-specific results (mean group tests). While offering increased power and the ability to control for asset-specific effects, a primary challenge in panel bubble detection is the appropriate handling of cross-sectional dependence, which is pervasive in interconnected financial markets and can distort test statistics if not addressed.​  

Complementing panel methods, factor models provide a structured way to decompose asset price dynamics into common and idiosyncratic components.  

![](images/53810e64b39f7afdeb7006ee9933cfb7e98e1d3149dd88d79637af2ab613c71e.jpg)  

Specifically designed factor models incorporate both standard $I ( 1 )$ factors representing fundamental drivers and mildly explosive factors hypothesized to capture common, latent bubble forces [3,5]. This framework allows for the statistical testing of common explosive components and the date-stamping of their likely origination across a large number of assets [3,5]. The theoretical properties of such tests, including the asymptotics of the test statistic and the consistency of datestamping, have been established under both the null of no common bubbles and the alternative hypothesis [3,5].​  

Beyond detecting bubbles, understanding how they spread and interact within the financial system is paramount. Contagion models offer a direct framework for assessing the propagation of shocks and exuberance across markets or asset classes [24]. Relatedly, the concept of spillover effects quantifies the transmission of movements between markets, which can be evaluated using techniques like rolling-window spillover indices [21]. Methodologies like the Diebold and Yilmaz approach, based on Vector Autoregression (VAR) models, are utilized to construct measures of interconnectedness and  

analyze dynamic spillovers among financial variables [19,24]. VAR models generally allow for the analysis of dynamic interactions between multiple time series, providing insights into how shocks to one variable might affect others within a system. Cointegration tests, by identifying long-run relationships, can also signal potential bubble conditions through significant deviations from equilibrium.  

Furthermore, network models provide a visual and analytical structure for mapping complex interdependencies within financial systems, essential for understanding shock transmission and identifying systemically vulnerable nodes [24]. These models can analyze sophisticated relationships, such as how firm characteristics influence stock returns within a connected market structure, potentially revealing mechanisms of localized transmission [17]. Advanced network models, such as those incorporating latent spaces to model network formation and allowing coefficients to vary across nodes [17], offer powerful tools for dissecting these complex dynamics.​  

While these multivariate and network approaches significantly enhance our ability to detect, analyze, and understand the transmission of financial bubbles, they also face challenges. A notable difficulty lies in distinguishing true contagion or spillover effects, which propagate along system links, from simultaneous reactions to common, unobserved shocks affecting multiple entities independently. Moreover, the results from these models can be sensitive to specific model assumptions, including the chosen panel structure, the specification of factor models, the variables included in VAR systems, and the definition of network links, necessitating careful validation and robustness checks in empirical applications.​  

# 4.1 Panel Data Approaches  

The application of panel data methods represents a significant advancement in the statistical testing for explosive financial bubbles. Utilizing data across multiple assets or markets over time offers distinct advantages over univariate time series analysis. A primary benefit is the substantial increase in statistical power. By pooling observations from numerous series, researchers can achieve more precise estimates and enhance their ability to detect periods of explosive dynamics, even when the effect is subtle within individual series. Furthermore, panel data models can effectively control for unobserved heterogeneity across different assets or markets. This allows researchers to account for stable, asset-specific characteristics or common factors that might otherwise confound the detection of bubble behavior, leading to more robust and reliable inferences.​  

The methodology for detecting bubbles is extended to the panel data context through approaches like the panel Generalized Supremum Augmented Dickey-Fuller (GSADF) test. This typically involves adapting the recursive regression framework used in univariate GSADF tests to accommodate the panel structure. While the specific implementation can vary, common approaches include pooled tests that aggregate information across the panel or mean group tests that average individual unit statistics. These methods aim to identify explosive roots that manifest simultaneously or sequentially across panel members, providing a more comprehensive picture of bubble activity within a group of assets.​  

Implementing panel GSADF tests presents several challenges. A critical issue is handling potential cross-sectional dependence among the panel members. Financial markets are often interconnected, and ignoring dependencies between asset returns or prices can lead to size distortions and biased inference in standard panel unit root or explosivity tests. Researchers must employ techniques that account for various forms of dependence, such as cross-sectionally augmented methods or factor models. Other challenges include selecting the appropriate panel structure (e.g., fixed effects versus random effects), managing unbalanced panels, and dealing with the computational intensity that increases with the number of cross-sectional units and time periods. The sensitivity of results to the chosen panel method and the approach for handling cross-sectional dependence necessitates careful consideration and robustness checks in empirical applications.  

# 4.2 Factor Models for Common Bubble Detection  

Factor models offer a structured approach to identifying common drivers of financial phenomena, including the formation of asset price bubbles—particularly in large-dimensional financial systems [5]. This methodology allows for the decomposition of asset price movements into components attributable to common factors, thereby enabling the detection of shared bubble dynamics across multiple assets [5].  

A specific factor model framework designed for bubble detection incorporates factors representing distinct phases of market behavior [3]. This model includes both $I ( 1 )$ factors, which capture the primary, non-stationary driving forces related to market fundamentals under normal conditions, and mildly explosive factors, which are hypothesized to model the latent forces underlying the formation of asset price bubbles during exuberant periods [3]. By distinguishing between these types of factors, the model aims to capture both the normal and the potentially exuberant phases observed in financial markets [3].​  

Within this framework, an algorithm is proposed to test for the presence of these common latent factors driving price bubbles and to date-stamp the likely origination point of such bubbles [3,5]. This algorithm provides a systematic procedure for statistical inference regarding the presence and timing of common bubble events [3,5].  

Theoretical properties of this factor bubble detection process have been analyzed. Specifically, the asymptotic properties of the bubble test statistic are derived under both the null hypothesis—which posits the absence of common bubbles—and the alternative hypothesis, which suggests the presence of a common bubble affecting various markets [3,5]. Furthermore, the consistency of the factor bubble detection process in accurately identifying the origination date of a common bubble has been formally established [3].  

# 4.3 Contagion, VAR, Cointegration, and Network Models  

Analyzing the transmission and interaction effects within financial markets is crucial for understanding the dynamics of explosive financial bubbles. Contagion models provide a framework for examining how shocks, including those associated with bubbles, can propagate across different markets, asset classes, or financial institutions [24]. By mapping the interconnections within the financial system, these models help identify vulnerable nodes and assess the potential pathways for bubble exuberance or collapse to spread [24].  

Related to contagion is the concept of spillover effects, which describe the transmission of movements (e.g., price changes, volatility) from one market or asset to another. Approaches like the rolling-window spillover index, while potentially simplified, offer a means to quantify these cross-market transmissions, akin to the mechanisms explored in contagion analysis [21]. For instance, exuberance originating in a primary market, such as first-tier housing, can spill over into secondary markets, like second-tier cities [21]. The Diebold and Yilmaz spillover approach further utilizes Vector Autoregression (VAR) models to analyze contagion among financial markets by capturing the interconnectedness between them [19].​  

VAR models are valuable tools in this context as they allow for the analysis of dynamic interactions between multiple time series variables. By examining the impulse responses and variance decompositions derived from VAR models, researchers can understand how shocks to one variable, potentially indicative of bubble behavior, affect others in the system [19]. While the digests primarily link VAR to contagion and spillover, the ability of VAR models to model variable interactions provides a basis for exploring interdependencies that may characterize bubble formation and transmission.  

Cointegration tests, although not explicitly detailed in the provided digests, complement these approaches by identifying long-run equilibrium relationships between variables. Deviations from such stable equilibria can signal unsustainable dynamics, potentially indicative of a bubble phase where asset prices diverge significantly from their fundamental values or relationships with other economic variables. Detecting a lack of cointegration or temporary departures from a cointegrating relationship can thus serve as an indicator of market disequilibrium associated with bubble conditions.  

Network models offer a more explicit representation of the complex structure of interdependencies within financial systems. They are significant in assessing the transmission of shocks across various assets or regions by visualizing and quantifying the links between financial entities or markets [24]. This allows for the identification of systemically important nodes whose distress could trigger widespread contagion [24]. Beyond simple network mapping, advanced network models can analyze specific relationships relevant to market dynamics. For example, a network varying coefficient model has been introduced to analyze the relationship between stock returns and firm characteristics from a network perspective [17]. This model extends traditional regression by allowing coefficients to vary based on latent “locations” of network nodes, which drive network formation [17]. The methodology involves identifying latent locations via a latent space model and employing an iterative projected gradient descent algorithm for optimizing network parameters and regression coefficients [17]. A penalization procedure is often combined to select covariates with significant varying coefficients [17]. Such detailed network analysis provides insights into how firm-level characteristics influence returns within a connected market structure, potentially revealing how localized exuberance or distress is transmitted.​  

Despite their utility, these models face limitations. A primary challenge is distinguishing true contagion or specific spillover effects from common shocks that simultaneously affect multiple markets or assets. Disentangling whether simultaneous movements are due to direct transmission along network links or independent reactions to a shared macroeconomic or  

global event remains difficult. Furthermore, the specification of network structures, the choice of variables in VAR models, and the definition of equilibrium relationships in cointegration tests can be subjective and sensitive to model assumptions, potentially impacting the reliability of bubble detection or transmission analysis.​

Analyzing financial bubbles, characterized by complex, non-linear dynamics, sudden regime shifts, and extreme price movements, necessitates the application of advanced econometric and statistical techniques that move beyond standard linear models. This section provides an overview of several sophisticated methods employed to detect, monitor, and understand bubble phenomena, highlighting their specific capabilities and limitations in capturing different facets of bubble evolution and potential collapse.​  

A key challenge in bubble analysis is modeling the inherent non-linearity and the transitions between distinct market states. Econometric models such as time-varying parameter, Markov-switching, and state-space models offer frameworks to capture these dynamics. Regime-switching models, for instance, explicitly model shifts between states (e.g., normal, explosive, collapse), allowing for the identification of critical turning points based on estimated regime probabilities. While powerful in capturing time-varying behavior and abrupt changes, these models face challenges in determining the optimal number of regimes, parameter estimation sensitivity, and the interpretation of statistical regimes in economic terms.​  

Given that bubble bursts are inherently extreme events, techniques focusing on tail risk are crucial. Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is specifically designed to model the behavior of extreme events and the tails of probability distributions [20,25]. Applied in financial risk management, EVT facilitates the calculation of risk measures like Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) by fitting extreme value distributions (e.g., Generalized Pareto Distribution using Peaks Over Threshold) to tail data [20,25]. EVT-based measures often provide more accurate estimates of potential large losses during bubble periods compared to traditional methods that assume normality, which tend to underestimate tail risks [25]. However, the application of EVT is sensitive to data availability for extreme events and choices regarding thresholds or block sizes [20].  

Another approach, the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, focuses on identifying accelerating price dynamics that often precede financial crashes [1]. This model posits that asset prices before a crash exhibit log-periodic oscillations superimposed on a power-law increase, suggesting a critical point phenomenon. The theoretical foundation often relates to collective herding behavior among market participants. The model describes asset price dynamics through a stochastic differential equation:​  

$$
d P _ { t } = P _ { t } \mu d t + P _ { t } \sigma d W _ { t } + \left( P _ { c r a s h } - P _ { t } \right) d J _ { t }
$$  

where $\left\backslash \left( \mathsf { m u } \right\backslash \right)$ is related to the crash hazard rate \(\lambda(t)\), which accelerates as the critical time \(T_{crash}\) is approached [1]. While effective in capturing super-exponential growth patterns, the LPPLS model's limitations include ensitivity to parameter estimation and defining criteria for a bubble signal, although confidence indicators are used [1].  

To address issues arising from assumptions about data distribution and mean-based analysis, Quantile Regression (QR) offers a valuable alternative. QR allows for the analysis of different quantiles of the conditional distribution, which is particularly useful for financial data exhibiting skewness and heteroskedasticity [4]. QR has been used to develop a QRbased quantile unit root test, functioning as a global bubble test, and two QR-based monitoring techniques capable of dating bubble origination [4]. These methods have shown promise, especially with skewed distributions, though comprehensive comparative performance analysis with traditional methods is still evolving.​  

Furthermore, nonparametric methods are increasingly recognized for their potential to overcome limitations of parametric tests by making fewer assumptions about the underlying data distribution [24], offering flexibility in capturing non-linear and asymmetric dependencies during stress periods. Wavelet analysis provides another avenue by decomposing time series into different frequency components, allowing for the detection of bubble signals across various time scales, which can offer insights into the multi-scale nature of bubble phenomena.​  

In summary, advanced techniques like regime-switching models, EVT, LPPLS, QR-based methods, nonparametric approaches, and wavelet analysis provide powerful tools for analyzing the complex characteristics of financial bubbles, including non-linear dynamics, tail risk, accelerating growth patterns, and multi-scale behavior. Each method offers unique advantages but also presents limitations related to model assumptions, parameter sensitivity, data requirements, and interpretation. Integrating insights from these diverse techniques can lead to a more robust understanding of bubble formation, evolution, and potential collapse, informing risk management and policy interventions.  

# 5.1 Regime-Switching Models  

Regime-switching models are frequently utilized in the analysis of financial bubbles to capture the inherent non-linear dynamics and distinct phases (or regimes) that characterize bubble formation, acceleration, and eventual collapse. These models assume that the underlying data-generating process for asset prices or bubble indicators switches between different states, each defined by its own set of parameters. For example, a typical framework might comprise a "normal" regime marked by fundamental-driven price movements, an "explosive" regime indicative of speculative exuberance and unsustainable price growth, and possibly a "collapse" regime in which prices experience a sharp decline.  

By accommodating shifts between these regimes, the models can effectively identify critical turning points in bubble dynamics, such as transitions from a normal state to an explosive one or the onset of a collapse. This is achieved by estimating the probability of the system being in each regime at any point in time based on observed data. The key strength of regime-switching models lies in their capacity to capture complex, time-varying behaviors that linear models simply cannot, providing a flexible framework for modeling sudden shifts in market behavior and potentially offering insights into the timing and nature of bubble transitions.  

Nevertheless, the application of regime-switching models faces several limitations. Determining the appropriate number of regimes often proves challenging and may necessitate prior assumptions or the use of model selection criteria. Additionally, parameter estimation can be highly sensitive to initial conditions and sample size, particularly when regime transitions occur infrequently. Moreover, interpreting regimes as specific market states (e.g., an explosive bubble) depends largely on the model’s ability to accurately map statistical regimes onto economic phenomena, a process that is not always straightforward. Finally, the performance of these models in out-of-sample forecasting—especially in predicting the precise timing of a bubble collapse—remains an area of active research and validation.​  

# 5.2 Extreme Value Theory (EVT)  

Extreme Value Theory (EVT) provides a framework for modeling the stochastic behavior of extreme events, specifically focusing on the tails of probability distributions. In the context of financial asset prices, EVT is employed to model tail behavior and quantify the risk associated with extreme price movements, which are particularly relevant during periods characterized by the presence of financial bubbles [20]. Key EVT techniques utilized for this purpose include the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) when applying the Peaks Over Threshold (POT) method, and the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution when using the block maxima method. These methods are designed to capture the statistical properties of rare, large fluctuations that traditional models based on assumptions like normality often fail to adequately represent [20,25].  

The application of EVT in financial risk management leads to the derivation of important risk measures, notably Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) [20,25]. These measures, calculated using EVT-based tail models, provide estimates of potential large losses under adverse market conditions. When comparing the performance of EVT-based risk measures with traditional methods, such as those assuming a normal distribution for returns, EVT-based approaches generally offer more accurate estimates of extreme losses [25]. This increased accuracy is critical for capturing the amplified tail risks characteristic of bubble periods, where market crashes or sharp corrections represent extreme events. Traditional methods often underestimate the likelihood and magnitude of such events due to their inability to accurately model the heavy tails observed in financial data, especially during periods of market stress or speculative exuberance [25]. EVT directly addresses this limitation by focusing on the empirical distribution of extreme observations.​  

Using EVT in the context of bubble detection and risk quantification offers advantages, primarily its ability to provide robust estimates of extreme quantiles and tail probabilities, which are essential for understanding the potential impact of bubble bursts [25]. However, the application of EVT is not without limitations [20]. Its effectiveness is sensitive to data quality, requiring a sufficient number of extreme observations for reliable tail estimation. Furthermore, the choice of threshold in POT methods or block size in block maxima methods, as well as the fitting of the chosen extreme value distribution, involves parameter choices that can significantly influence the results. The sensitivity to these choices necessitates careful model selection and validation procedures to ensure the reliability of the derived risk measures and insights into extreme price behavior during potential bubble phases [20].​  

# 5.3 Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) Model  

The Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, initially introduced as the Johansen-Ledoit-Sornette (JLS) model by Johansen, Ledoit, and Sornette, is a framework developed to capture and analyze the accelerating price dynamics frequently observed preceding financial bubble crashes [1]. The model posits that these dynamics are not purely random but exhibit log‐periodic oscillations superimposed on a power‐law increase, suggesting a critical point phenomenon akin to phase transitions in physics.  

The fundamental asset price dynamics before a crash are described by the stochastic differential equation:  

$$
d P _ { t } = P _ { t } \mu d t + P _ { t } \sigma d W _ { t } + \left( P _ { c r a s h } - P _ { t } \right) d J _ { t }
$$  

Here, $P _ { t }$ ​ represents the asset price at time $\textit { t , } \mu$ denotes the time-dependent return, $\sigma$ is the volatility, and $d W _ { t }$ ​ is the infinitesimal increment of a standard Wiener process. The term $d J _ { t }$ ​ is a jump process that remains zero before the crash occurs at the critical time $T _ { c r a s h }$ (denoted as $T$ in the digest) and transitions to one at the moment of the crash at $P _ { c r a s h }$ [1].​  

Under the assumptions of no arbitrage and rational expectations, the conditional expectation of the price dynamics is zero. The model posits that the return $\mu$ is proportional to the crash hazard rate $\lambda ( t )$ , which quantifies the instantaneous risk of a crash. In the presence of noise traders exhibiting herding behavior, this hazard rate $\lambda ( t )$ is argued to drive bubble growth, leading to an instantaneous return $\mu$ that increases with $\lambda ( t )$ to compensate investors for assuming higher crash risk [1].  

Conditioned on the assumption that no crash has occurred up to time $t$ , the asset price dynamics simplify to:  

$$
{ \frac { d P _ { t } } { P _ { t } } } = \lambda ( t ) d t + \sigma d W _ { t }
$$  

The conditional expectation of this process yields a solution for the asset price:  

$$
P _ { t } = E _ { t } \exp \left( \int _ { t } ^ { T } \lambda ( s ) d s \right)
$$  

To effectively model asset price behavior approaching a crash, a specific functional form for the crash hazard rate $\lambda ( t )$ is required [1].  

The theoretical underpinnings of the LPPLS model and the behavior of $\lambda ( t )$ are often related to collective herding behavior among market participants. Johansen, Ledoit, and Sornette proposed a microscopic agent-based model to capture local interactions. In this model, each agent $\mathbf { \chi } _ { i }$ is in one of two states, “buying” $( + 1 )$ or “selling” $( - 1 )$ , with their state at time $t + d t$ determined by a Markov process incorporating coupling strength $K$ with other agents $j$ and a random noise term $\epsilon _ { i } ( t )$ [1]. This agent-based perspective provides a potential mechanism by which $\lambda ( t )$ can evolve in a manner consistent with the log-periodic power law pattern observed in price trajectories. The accelerating increase in $\lambda ( t )$ as time approaches the critical point $T$ is central to the model’s ability to capture the super-exponential growth characteristic of financial bubbles before a potential crash [1].​  

# 5.4 Quantile Regression-Based Methods  

Quantile regression (QR) offers a flexible framework potentially well-suited for analyzing financial phenomena like bubbles, which often exhibit skewed distributions and heteroskedasticity. By examining different quantiles of the conditional distribution, QR provides a more comprehensive picture than traditional mean-based methods, which is particularly advantageous in detecting explosive behavior that might manifest differently across various points of the distribution [4].  

A notable application of QR in bubble detection is the development of a QR-based quantile unit root test. This test can serve as a global bubble test, demonstrating effectiveness in detecting bubbles without the necessity of additional recursive techniques, which are commonly employed in other bubble testing procedures [4]. The formulation of this test incorporates optimal quantile selection techniques to enhance its power and accuracy in identifying explosive dynamics at relevant parts of the conditional distribution [4]. The statistical properties of this test are derived to ensure valid inference under various scenarios.​  

Furthermore, QR has facilitated the development of two specific bubble monitoring techniques. These techniques are designed to not only detect the presence of a bubble but also to pinpoint its origination time. Under the null hypothesis of no bubble, the monitoring statistics of these QR-based techniques follow a specific random variate distribution [4]. Crucially, in the presence of a mildly explosive bubble, these statistics diverge towards positive infinity, a property that allows them to consistently date the moment the bubble begins to inflate [4]. Analysis based on simulations indicates the accuracy of these techniques in consistently identifying the origination points of bubbles [4]. Compared to traditional methods, the use of QR potentially offers enhanced robustness and insight, especially when dealing with financial data characterized by significant skewness and tail behavior, although detailed comparative performance metrics derived directly from the provided information are limited.​  

# 6. Machine Learning and AI Approaches  

The application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has emerged as a sophisticated avenue for identifying explosive financial bubbles, offering capabilities that extend beyond traditional statistical methodologies [16,24]. AI acts as a powerful information tool, enhancing price discovery through the efficient aggregation and analysis of vast datasets [23,24], and plays a crucial role in anomaly detection, where deviations indicative of bubble formations can be identified [16,24]. These models are adept at capturing complex, potentially non-linear dynamics and subtle patterns in financial markets that may signal the onset or progression of a bubble [16,24].  

A range of ML and deep learning algorithms are employed in this domain, including SVMs, decision trees, neural networks, and particularly deep learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks [16]. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network specifically designed for processing sequential data, making them highly suitable for analyzing financial time series [16]. Their architecture, centered around a memory cell regulated by input, forget, and output gates, enables them to effectively learn and manage long-term dependencies and temporal patterns within the data [16]. This gating mechanism allows LSTMs to retain relevant past information and discard irrelevant data, which is crucial for modeling the evolving nature of financial markets and potential bubble phases [16].  

![](images/0de189e13f08e931b6d65c74e0a0861dc32e9bf7c8ce4d137faafda3c05d3025.jpg)  

Effective application of these models necessitates rigorous data preprocessing and feature extraction. The process typically begins with collecting historical market data, followed by essential preprocessing steps such as cleaning and normalization to ensure data quality and suitability for model training [16]. Feature extraction involves deriving informative signals, like technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI), from raw data to serve as inputs that encapsulate market dynamics relevant to bubble detection [16]. Model performance is subsequently evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, recall, and the F1 score to assess their efficacy in correctly identifying bubble states [16].​  

Despite their potential, the use of ML/AI for bubble detection presents several challenges. These include significant data requirements, complexities in data preprocessing and feature engineering, and the critical task of appropriate model selection [16]. Overfitting is a notable risk, where models may perform well on training data but fail to generalize to unseen market conditions [16]. Furthermore, challenges related to data bias and the often limited interpretability of complex "black box" models pose significant hurdles. AI also currently lacks the capacity to fully understand subtle social and cultural nuances that can influence human interaction in financial markets, representing another limitation [23]. Compared to traditional statistical tests, ML/AI models offer the advantage of potentially capturing more complex and non-linear relationships, but they require more extensive data and careful validation to avoid spurious results.  

# 6.1 AI Algorithms and Deep Learning (LSTM)  

The application of machine learning algorithms has emerged as a promising approach for analyzing complex financial time series data and identifying potential market anomalies, including speculative bubbles. Among various machine learning techniques, deep learning architectures, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are well-suited for modeling sequential data due to their inherent ability to capture temporal dependencies. One study explicitly adopts LSTM networks for market bubble identification and anomaly detection, leveraging their capability to process and remember information over extended sequences [16].  

LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) specifically designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem encountered in traditional RNNs, enabling them to learn long-term dependencies. The architecture and operation of an LSTM cell are characterized by several interacting gates that regulate the flow of information into and out of the memory cell [16]. The input gate controls how much of the current input information is allowed to update the state of the memory cell [16]. The forget gate determines which information stored in the memory cell should be discarded, allowing the network to remove irrelevant past information [16]. Finally, the output gate regulates how much of the information contained in the memory cell is exposed and passed on to the next time step or used for prediction [16]. This gating mechanism enables LSTMs to effectively manage information flow, making them powerful tools for modeling the complex, time-dependent patterns present in financial markets that might indicate bubble formations [16].​  

While the specific strengths and weaknesses relative to other algorithms for bubble detection require further comparative study, the architectural design of LSTMs provides a compelling basis for their application in capturing the dynamic and potentially non-linear characteristics associated with bubble dynamics.​  

# 6.2 Data Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, and Model Evaluation  

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques for identifying financial bubbles necessitates rigorous data preparation and feature engineering. The process typically commences with the collection of historical market data [16]. Subsequent steps involve data preprocessing, which includes essential operations such as cleaning and normalization to ensure data quality and consistency for model input [16].  

Following preprocessing, feature extraction is performed to derive relevant signals from the raw market data. This involves calculating technical indicators designed to capture underlying market dynamics and potential patterns associated with bubble formation, including moving averages and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) [16]. These features serve as inputs for the ML/DL models.  

After building and training the models, their performance in identifying bubbles or anomalies is critically evaluated. Standard evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, recall, and the F1 score [16], are employed to quantify the models effectiveness. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify bubble states while minimizing false positives and negatives.​

This section delves into specialized and emerging topics in the statistical detection of financial bubbles, moving beyond standard methodologies to explore advanced computational techniques, the critical need for real-time warning systems, and the granular analysis of asset markets at sub-national levels. A key area of exploration involves evaluating the application of computational methods adapted from physics, such as Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, within financial modeling, particularly for tasks related to FOREX markets and the detection of speculative attacks or bubbles [12]. Research in this domain investigates techniques like Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC), demonstrating potential advantages over classical statistical and machine learning methods in terms of estimation accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and performance with limited data samples [12]. These advancements are relevant for improving the baseline estimation against which price anomalies are detected. While the broader potential of quantum computing to enhance the precision and efficiency of financial models for anticipating volatility and managing risks is a significant, ongoing area of research, practical implications and implementation challenges for widespread adoption warrant further investigation [12].  

Another critical focus is the development and implementation of real-time bubble detection techniques to establish effective early warning systems. This includes exploring various econometric approaches applicable across housing and financial markets [9], as well as employing methods like multi-scale thought and model recognition for constructing financial risk warning systems [22]. Specific models designed for real-time bubble risk detection have been proposed and evaluated, highlighting advantages such as general applicability, immediacy, robustness, and ease of implementation [14]. The effective implementation of such systems necessitates clearly defined procedures, including precise alarming criteria, robust warning response mechanisms, and comprehensive management procedures [14]. However, inherent challenges in implementing early warning systems, such as ensuring data availability, precise model calibration, and timely policy responses, remain significant considerations [14].​  

Furthermore, analyzing house price dynamics at a disaggregated, city-specific level is vital for identifying localized bubble phenomena that may be obscured in national aggregates. Studies applying econometric tests to examine real house prices and price–to–rent ratios for explosive behavior at the city level have provided significant insights [6]. For instance, research examining house price cycles in Lithuania over 1994–2022 found widespread evidence of long and multiple periods of explosive behavior across all major cities [6]. These findings underscore the potential for systemic speculative activity and carry considerable implications for economic performance, including housing affordability and resource allocation, and for financial stability, particularly regarding the vulnerability of the banking sector [6]. Such city-level analyses, extending to studies in other regions like China [21], emphasize the importance of granular investigation for understanding both local dynamics and the potential for synchronized bubble episodes across different urban centers.​  

# 7.1 Quantum Computing and Monte Carlo Simulations  

The application of computational techniques from physics, such as Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, is being explored for complex financial modeling tasks, including those relevant to detecting financial bubbles and speculative attacks [12]. These methods, potentially leveraging the power of quantum computing platforms, offer promise for tackling problems that are computationally intensive or intractable for classical approaches.​  

One specific QMC method, Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC), has been investigated for its capabilities in estimating financial market dynamics, specifically in FOREX markets [12]. Studies indicate that AFQMC holds significant advantages over conventional statistical and machine learning techniques, including standard regression, deep learning, and classical Monte Carlo methods [12].​  

The key benefits reported for AFQMC include its ability to achieve more robust estimations with higher accuracy, both within the sample data and when predicting out-of-sample [12]. Furthermore, AFQMC demonstrates better performance when dealing with datasets characterized by small or irregular samples, a common challenge in financial time series analysis [12]. From a computational efficiency standpoint, AFQMC requires less time for generating estimates compared to classical alternatives, which contributes to reduced model instability over time [12].  

These methodological advantages in accuracy, robustness, and efficiency are directly relevant to the task of identifying and forecasting financial instabilities like bubbles or speculative attacks. More accurate and stable market estimations provide a stronger baseline against which anomalous price deviations, characteristic of bubble formation or speculative pressure, can be detected. The improved handling of potentially limited or noisy financial data further enhances the practical applicability of these methods. While the theoretical computational speedups promised by quantum computing hardware for certain algorithms are a broader area of research, the specific AFQMC method discussed demonstrates practical performance benefits on existing computational platforms compared to classical statistical and machine learning benchmarks [12]. However, the provided analysis primarily highlights the method's strengths and does not detail the practical implications or implementation challenges associated with adopting AFQMC or integrating it with quantum computing infrastructure for widespread financial applications.  

# 7.2 Real-Time Bubble Detection and Early Warning Systems  

The development of techniques for detecting financial bubbles in real-time is a critical area of research aimed at establishing effective early warning systems. Various approaches are explored within this field, ranging from general econometric techniques applied to different markets, including housing and financial sectors [9], to specialized methods like multi-scale thought and model recognition for constructing financial risk warning systems [22].​  

A specific focus in recent research involves proposing and evaluating dedicated models for real-time bubble risk detection [14]. One such model has been analyzed for its effectiveness in building a real-time early warning system, particularly within the agricultural futures market [14]. This research identified several key advantages of the proposed model for real-time detection, highlighting its general applicability across different contexts, its immediacy in providing timely signals, its robustness against various market conditions, and its convenience in implementation and use [14].  

Implementing real-time early warning systems based on such detection models requires clearly defined procedures and components. The research on the specific real-time bubble risk detecting model [14] further proposed essential elements for an effective warning system. These include establishing precise alarming criteria to signal potential bubble formation, defining a clear warning response mechanism outlining the actions to be taken upon receiving a warning, and outlining a comprehensive five-step early warning management procedure to guide the overall process from detection to response and monitoring [14]. While the implementation of such systems presents inherent challenges, including setting optimal thresholds and ensuring timely and appropriate responses, the articulation of these specific components and procedures represents a structured approach towards building functional real-time bubble detection and early warning capabilities [14].  

# 7.3 City-Level Analysis of House Price Cycles  

Analyzing housing price dynamics at a granular, city‐specific level is crucial for identifying localized bubble phenomena that might be obscured in aggregated national data. Research in this area applies econometric procedures to detect speculative behavior in urban real estate markets. A notable study focusing on city‐level analysis examines house price cycles in Lithuania over the period 1994–2022 [6].​  

This research employed econometric tests to investigate real house prices and house price–to–rent ratios for evidence of explosive behavior [6].  

The findings from this study provide compelling evidence of widespread speculative activity: it detected long and multiple periods characterized by explosive behavior in the real estate market across al major cities within Lithuania during the extensive sample period [6].  

This consistency in findings across different urban centers within the same country over a significant timeframe underscore the systemic nature of the bubble dynamics observed [6].  

Such widespread and prolonged explosive growth in house prices carries significant implications for both economic performance and financial stability. Economically, it can lead to reduced housing affordability, potential misallocation of resources towards real estate, and risks of sharp price corrections that could negatively impact household wealth and  

consumption. From a financial stability perspective, widespread bubbles increase the vulnerability of the banking sector to mortgage defaults and asset value declines.  

Beyond the Lithuanian context, other studies also focus on city‐level dynamics, such as research examining housing price and rental data in specific Chinese cities, including four first‐tier and six second‐tier urban areas [21].  

While the specific findings regarding explosive behavior from this particular study are not detailed in the provided digest, its focus highlights the broader trend of analyzing urban housing markets at a disaggregated level to better understand localized dynamics and potential bubble formation [21].  

The consistent finding of explosive behavior across multiple cities in the Lithuanian study [6] suggests that while local factors are important, broader national or international influences may also contribute to synchronized bubble episodes across different urban centers.​

Empirical analysis of historical and recent financial bubbles across various asset markets is fundamental to understanding their formation, dynamics, and consequences, as well as evaluating the efficacy of statistical detection methods [2,10,13]. These case studies provide concrete evidence of explosive price behavior and the factors contributing to market instability, offering valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and investors.  

Historical episodes such as the Dutch Tulip Mania, the South Sea Bubble, and the Mississippi Company Bubble [13,15], the 1920s stock market bubble culminating in the Wall Street Crash [10,13], and more recent events like the Dotcom bubble [2,11] and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis [6,10,11,13,24] serve as crucial benchmarks. These instances, alongside others like the Norwegian banking crisis of the early 1990s [10] and asset-price busts in the UK (1974) and Japan (1992) [11], consistently highlight key characteristics of bubbles, including a significant detachment of asset prices from fundamental values and subsequent sharp declines with severe economic repercussions [11,13,15,24].  

Recent bubbles, such as the 2015 Chinese A-Share market and the 2017 cryptocurrency surge, provide further contemporary evidence [13]. The 2015 A-Share bubble was influenced by factors unique to the Chinese market, including high retail investor participation, extensive margin trading, and government intervention, while the 2017 crypto bubble was largely driven by technological optimism and speculative trading in a nascent asset class [13]. Despite these differences, both episodes demonstrate the pervasive influence of behavioral factors, including herding, over-optimism, and the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), which amplify speculative dynamics across historical periods and market types [13]. Behavioral finance research further indicates that focusing excessively on historical crash narratives can sometimes lead investors to overlook other relevant statistical information, potentially stimulating speculation [23].  

Statistical tests for explosive dynamics have been widely applied to identify and analyze these and other bubble episodes across diverse asset markets, including stock markets (e.g., US, China), real estate (e.g., US, China, Lithuania), cryptocurrency, commodities (e.g., soybean, sugar, rice), and exchange rates (e.g., USD/EUR, USD/JPY) [3,5,6,8,12,14,18,19,21,22,24]. For instance, the modified PWY method and the GSADF test have been applied to the Shanghai Stock Index, identifying multiple bubble periods consistent with actual market conditions [7,8]. The LPPLS method has also successfully detected the 2007 and 2015 bubbles in the Chinese stock market, correlating its diagnoses with well-known historical events and suggesting the possibility of early detection [1]. Empirical studies using real estate data in major cities across China and Lithuania have also found evidence of explosive behavior and common bubble episodes, particularly in higher-tier cities [3,5,6,21].​  

Comparing the performance of different methodologies in these real-world applications reveals their respective strengths and limitations [8,18]. For example, the modified PWY method demonstrated improved performance over the traditional PWY method in detecting multiple bubbles in the Shanghai Stock Index [8]. Studies applying procedures that account for deterministic trends to US stock and real estate data show better alignment with observed termination dates and avoid spurious detection of negative bubble episodes compared to methods like PSY, highlighting the importance of model specification [18]. Challenges remain, such as effectively detecting continuous bubbles within a sample interval using traditional methods, which requires specific approaches for real-time early warning systems [14]. Discrepancies in findings across studies can often be attributed to variations in methodology, the specific time periods analyzed, data quality, or unique characteristics of the markets under investigation.​  

The empirical findings underscore the critical role of behavioral factors alongside fundamental and technical drivers in bubble formation and bursting [13]. Understanding these factors is essential for interpreting statistical results and informing policy responses. The ability of statistical tests to identify bubble episodes in various markets has significant implications for policymakers seeking to monitor systemic risk and implement timely interventions, and for investors aiming to manage risk and avoid significant losses during market downturns [1]. Continued empirical application and comparative analysis of different detection methodologies are crucial for refining our ability to identify and respond to speculative bubbles in financial markets.​             ​  

# 8.1 Analysis of Historical Bubbles (e.g., Tulip Mania, South Sea, 1920s, Dotcom, 2008 Crisis)  

Historical instances of financial bubbles provide critical insights into the underlying mechanisms, behavioral patterns, and detrimental consequences of such phenomena, serving as essential case studies for both economic theory and statistical detection methods [13,15]. These episodes have consistently demonstrated adverse effects on economic performance and financial stability, frequently preceding periods of significant economic weakness or crisis, such as the Great Depression or Japan's "lost decade" [6,10,11].​  

Early examples, like the Dutch Tulip Mania in the 17th century, illustrate how markets can be driven by factors entirely detached from fundamental value [13,15]. The Tulip Mania was characterized by intense herding behavior, fueled by the fear of missing out on potential profits ("从众行为"), widespread overconfidence in the perpetual rise of prices, and excessive speculation [13]. Similarly, the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Company Bubble in the early 18th century were propelled by excessive investor optimism, inadequate understanding of the underlying ventures, and financial innovations of the time [13,15]. These bubbles highlight the potent role of collective psychological biases and detachment from economic fundamentals in bubble formation.​  

Moving into the 20th century, the 1920s stock market bubble, culminating in the Wall Street Crash, serves as another stark example [10,13]. This period was marked by excessive leverage, a significant disconnect between inflated asset prices and economic realities, and the pervasive influence of behavioral biases including herding, over-optimism, recency bias, and loss aversion [13]. The subsequent crisis of the 1930s and the Great Depression in the United States are often identified with the asset-price busts that preceded them [10,11]. Japan's "lost decade" of the 1990s also demonstrates the severe, prolonged economic consequences linked to rapidly falling asset prices and resultant banking sector problems [11].  

More recent history includes the Dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s [2,11]. This episode involved specific market dynamics related to the nascent internet industry, pronounced behavioral factors driving speculation, and particular policy responses [2]. Statistical evidence from this period demonstrates the dramatic scale of the collapse; for instance, the NASDAQ composite index lost nearly $8 0 \%$ of its value between 2000 and 2002 during the bubble's burst [2]. The lessons learned from the Dotcom bubble include the dangers of valuing assets based purely on speculative future growth rather than fundamentals, the influence of media and public excitement, and the challenges for policymakers in identifying and responding to asset bubbles [2]. While the subsequent U.S. recession in 2001 was relatively shallow, this has been attributed in part to the health of the financial sector at the time and swift fiscal and monetary policy responses, contrasting with crises where the financial system is more impaired [11].  

The 2008 Global Financial Crisis, also known as the Great Recession (2007-2009), stands as a significant modern case study [6,10,11,13,24]. This crisis was fundamentally triggered by the subprime mortgage collapse but was exacerbated by the proliferation of complex financial instruments, excessive leverage across the financial system, and deep global interconnectedness [13]. Behavioral biases such as overconfidence, herding, fear, and loss aversion also played crucial roles in amplifying the crisis dynamics [13]. A key aspect demonstrated by the 2008 crisis was the mechanism of financial contagion, illustrating how initial shocks in one segment, such as the subprime market, could rapidly propagate across different markets and international borders, leading to a widespread economic downturn [24]. The crisis underscored the severe adverse effects of asset bubbles and busts on overall economic performance and financial stability [6].  

Collectively, these historical episodes reveal recurring patterns: periods of irrational exuberance often fueled by behavioral biases like herding and overconfidence, a disconnect between asset prices and fundamental value, the role of leverage and complex financial instruments, and significant negative consequences for the broader economy and financial system upon collapse [11,13,15,24]. Studying these historical bubbles provides a crucial foundation for developing and evaluating statistical methods aimed at detecting the formation of explosive dynamics in financial markets.  

# 8.2 Examination of Recent Bubbles (e.g., 2015 A-Share, 2017 Crypto)  

Recent financial history provides several compelling examples of market bubbles, notably the 2015 Chinese A-Share market and the 2017 cryptocurrency surge. An in-depth analysis of these episodes reveals critical insights into the events, behavioral dynamics, and market forces driving bubble formation and collapse [13].  

The 2015 A-Share bubble in China was significantly influenced by distinct market characteristics and investor behavior [13]. Key contributing factors included enthusiastic participation from retail investors, extensive use of margin trading, and the impact of government intervention and assurances on investor confidence [13]. Behavioral elements such as herding and over-optimism were prominent, amplifying the speculative fever [13]. Statistical tests have been applied to identify and  

analyze this period. The LPPLS method, for instance, successfully detected the 2015 Chinese stock market bubble, correlating its diagnosis with well-documented historical events [1]. Furthermore, studies employing the modified PWY method and the GSADF test on the Shanghai Stock Index series from 2000 to 2019 have also identified bubbles within this timeframe, consistent with observed market conditions [7,8].​  

In contrast, the 2017 cryptocurrency bubble was primarily fueled by technological optimism surrounding blockchain and cryptocurrencies, widespread media hype, and intense speculative trading, particularly via Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) [13]. Similar to the A-Share case, behavioral biases like herding, over-optimism, and the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) played crucial roles in driving prices to unsustainable levels [13].  

Comparing these two recent bubbles reveals both common patterns and unique features [13]. Both episodes demonstrate the powerful influence of behavioral factors such as herding and over-optimism in propagating speculative trends [13]. However, the market structures and specific catalysts differed. The 2015 A-Share bubble was closely tied to traditional market mechanisms like margin trading and exhibited a strong influence of government policy and retail investor dominance [13]. The 2017 crypto bubble, conversely, was deeply rooted in technological enthusiasm for a nascent asset class and facilitated by novel fundraising mechanisms like ICOs, driven by a global, less regulated participant base [13].  

The collapse of both bubbles resulted in significant financial losses for participants and prompted a critical reassessment of market dynamics, regulatory frameworks, and investor protection mechanisms [13]. These events underscore the importance of identifying and monitoring potential bubble formation using statistical methods to provide early warnings and inform policy responses.​

Despite significant advancements in statistical methodologies for identifying explosive financial bubbles, substantial challenges and limitations persist, necessitating further research. A primary concern is the sensitivity of current test results to various factors, including data limitations, parameter choices, and model specification choices [16,18,25]. Data quality and privacy issues, as well as model overfitting and generalization ability, remain critical challenges, particularly given the increasing complexity of models and data sources [16]. The selection of appropriate thresholds in techniques like Extreme Value Theory (EVT), for instance, can significantly influence outcomes [25]. Furthermore, existing methods may struggle with specific data characteristics, such as the serial correlation often present in high-frequency financial time series, potentially limiting the detection capabilities of traditional approaches like the PWY method [7].  

A related challenge is the potential for false positives and the difficulty in distinguishing genuine explosive behavior from spurious detections caused by deterministic trends or structural breaks [18]. Current tests need refinement to improve their robustness against such confounding factors [18]. Moreover, accurately detecting asset price overvaluations and undervaluations—and thus potential bubbles—in real time presents a significant hurdle for both researchers and policymakers [11]. Sweeping generalizations about asset-price-bust recessions are often difficult to make, suggesting that effective responses may require tailor-made approaches for each specific episode [11]. Similarly, distinguishing financial contagion from normal market interdependence poses a challenge in understanding shock transmission mechanisms [24]. Overcoming psychological biases that contribute to bubble formation also remains an ongoing difficulty [15].​  

Addressing these limitations requires developing more robust and adaptive testing methodologies that are less sensitive to data quality, parameter choices, and specific model assumptions [1]. Future research should explore the integration of diverse perspectives and techniques through interdisciplinary approaches—combining insights from economics, statistics, and computer science [16]. This includes integrating financial econometrics with behavioral finance to better understand and identify behavioral biases, such as overconfidence, herding, and FOMO, that drive irrational exuberance and market complexities [13,15]. Developing models that explicitly incorporate these behavioral factors is crucial for improving the accuracy and timeliness of bubble detection [13].  

Another promising avenue involves integrating network analysis with traditional econometric models to capture the interconnectedness of financial markets and to understand how exuberance and spillover effects propagate, particularly in areas such as housing markets [17,21]. Future studies could investigate the underlying mechanisms driving these spillovers and the potential role of government policies [21]. Incorporating macroeconomic factors into detection models, perhaps by refining existing factor models or LPPLS confidence indicators, is also essential for a more comprehensive understanding [1,3].​  

Future directions also point toward leveraging alternative data sources, such as news, social media, and other nontraditional datasets, through multi-modal data fusion techniques [16]. Exploring advanced computational methods— including Quantum Monte Carlo, reinforcement learning, GRU, Kohonen’s self-organizing neural network, and modular neural networks—holds potential for improving volatility analysis, simulating speculative attacks, and enhancing model interpretability [12,16]. The application of EVT could be further advanced by combining it with other risk management or bubble detection techniques and applying it to new financial areas [20,25].  

Specific research questions for future exploration include investigating the implications of complex dynamics like rough paths and estimating parameters such as the Hurst exponent for asset pricing and risk management [17]. Applying techniques like fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes could offer new ways to model and test for bubbles in complex market environments [17]. Furthermore, improving the computational efficiency of tests and developing methodologies specifically tailored for complex market dynamics or emerging asset classes are necessary steps to enhance the practical utility of bubble detection tools. Addressing these challenges and pursuing these research avenues will be critical for improving the ability to identify, monitor, and potentially mitigate the risks associated with explosive financial bubbles, which are known to have adverse effects on economic performance and financial stability [6].​  

# 10. Conclusion  

This survey has reviewed a range of statistical tests and methodologies employed for detecting and analyzing explosive financial bubbles, synthesizing findings from various studies. A significant thread in the literature involves the application of recursive unit root tests, such as the GSADF test and variants of the PWY method, which have proven effective in identifying periods of explosive behavior and dating the initiation and termination of bubbles in financial time series data [6,7,8]. Notably, modifications to traditional approaches, such as the corrected PWY method accounting for serial correlation, have demonstrated superior performance in detecting multiple bubbles compared to their conventional counterparts [7,8]. Furthermore, the importance of considering deterministic trends when applying unit root tests for bubble detection has been highlighted to ensure robust identification of explosive behavior [18].  

Beyond unit root-based methods, alternative statistical techniques have emerged as valuable tools. Quantile Regression (QR) methods, for instance, offer effective global testing and real-time monitoring capabilities, often outperforming traditional Least Squares (LS) approaches, particularly when dealing with skewed financial data distributions [4]. The LPPLS confidence indicator has shown promise in identifying both positive and negative bubbles and providing advance warning of potential market shifts [1]. For large-dimensional systems, factor models provide a means to detect common bubbles driven by latent factors and analyze interdependencies across markets, such as regional housing markets [3,21]. Additionally, specialized tools like Extreme Value Theory (EVT) are recognized for their utility in modeling and quantifying financial risk [20], while advanced computational methods, such as those based on Atomic-like-orbital Fokker-Planck-based Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC), show potential for enhanced precision and efficiency in market modeling and risk management [12].​  

Despite the advancements in statistical detection methods, the literature underscores the inherent difficulty in precisely detecting asset-price bubbles and formulating clear-cut policy responses to perceived exuberance [11]. Challenges persist, including accurately identifying and mitigating the effects of financial contagion, a complex phenomenon with significant implications for stability [24]. Furthermore, the empirical evidence, such as the analysis of real estate markets across cities, emphasizes the need to consider regional interdependencies and common factors when studying bubbles [3,21]. A crucial insight from historical analyses is the persistent role of irrational behavior and behavioral biases in triggering financial bubbles [13,15]. While statistical tests are indispensable, effectively addressing the underlying psychological factors remains a significant challenge and opportunity [15].​  

The findings offer important policy implications. While predicting bubble bursts and their consequences with certainty is difficult, ensuring the health of the financial system through prudential supervision, promoting good risk management practices in banking, maintaining fiscal prudence, and achieving price stability during boom periods are highlighted as the most effective forms of insurance against asset price declines [11]. Statistical detection methods, such as the modified PWY and GSADF tests, contribute directly to identifying market risks and can guide efforts to prevent financial crises [7,8]. Recognizing and understanding behavioral biases is also considered essential for policymakers navigating financial markets [13].​  

Based on the current state of research and identified challenges, key directions for future work include further refining statistical tests to better account for complex market dynamics, such as deterministic trends and serial correlation [8,18]. Developing more robust methods for detecting and measuring financial contagion and analyzing interdependencies in large, interconnected systems remains crucial [3,21,24]. Integrating insights from behavioral finance more deeply into quantitative models could enhance predictive power and improve risk mitigation strategies [13,15]. Further exploration of advanced computational techniques and their application in real-time bubble surveillance and risk management also presents promising avenues for research [12]. Ultimately, continued research is vital to enhance our understanding of bubble formation, dynamics, and detection, contributing to efforts aimed at maintaining financial stability.​
