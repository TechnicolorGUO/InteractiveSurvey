# 0. Recent Developments in Measures of Association  

# 1. Introduction  

Measures of association are fundamental statistical tools used to quantify the relationship or dependence between two or more variables. They are indispensable across a multitude of scientific and applied disciplines, including economics, sociology, biology, and engineering, enabling researchers to understand how different elements co-vary and interact within a system [4,17,22,28,31]. Historically, classical measures such as the Pearson correlation coefficient have served as cornerstones for assessing linear relationships between variables [28]. However, these traditional approaches possess inherent limitations, particularly when confronted with non-linear dependencies, intricate data structures, and highdimensional datasets [1,23]. Complex systems, characterized by numerous interacting units exhibiting emergent properties and non-linear relationships, highlight the inadequacy of reductionist approaches and simple linear measures [1,13]. Similarly, the analysis of time series data, especially in contexts like anomaly detection, presents challenges due to complex temporal and inter-variable dependencies that classical methods may fail to capture [2,16,25]. The increasing availability of large-scale and complex datasets, including multi-omics data and big data, further underscores the need for more sophisticated analytical tools [15,21]. Classical approaches also face significant hurdles in distinguishing and quantifying complex causal relationships, particularly in systems with non-linearities and emergent phenomena [1,7].​  

These limitations have propelled significant advancements, leading to a paradigm shift towards more sophisticated techniques for measuring association. Recent developments draw heavily upon insights and methodologies from machine learning, information theory, and complex systems analysis, offering enhanced capabilities to capture diverse forms of dependence, including non-linear, multivariate, and temporally dynamic relationships [1,2,13,14,23]. Information theory, with concepts like entropy and mutual information, provides a robust framework for quantifying uncertainty and dependence in a model-free manner, sensitive to non-linear associations [9,14,29]. Machine learning techniques offer powerful data-driven approaches to identify complex patterns and dependencies, crucial for tasks like anomaly detection in time series or predicting outcomes in intricate systems [2,10,16,18]. Furthermore, the study of complex systems necessitates measures that go beyond simple pairwise associations to understand emergent properties, network interactions, and multiscale dependencies [1,13,22]. The field of causal discovery, deeply intertwined with understanding relationships, has also evolved significantly, employing graphical models and functional causal models to infer dependencies from observational data [6].​  

This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these recent developments in measures of association. We delineate key areas of progress driven by the integration of machine learning, information theory, and complex systems perspectives. By synthesizing insights from recent literature, this survey seeks to highlight the capabilities of these modern techniques in addressing the limitations of classical measures and handling the complexity of contemporary data. Our scope covers innovative methodologies for quantifying diverse forms of dependence, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses, and illustrating their application across various domains, thereby contributing to a more nuanced understanding of relationships in complex data environments.  

# 2. Foundational and Classical Measures  

The field of statistical measures of association has a rich history, particularly within the social sciences, reflecting the evolving complexity of research questions and data structures [4]. Early approaches, prevalent in the mid-20th century social sciences, heavily utilized simple cross-tabulations and associated measures to explore relationships between categorical variables. While foundational, these methods were often limited in their ability to assess complex, conditional relationships or handle continuous data effectively [4].  

A significant progression involved the development and application of techniques capable of analyzing the interplay of multiple variables. Log-linear models emerged as a powerful tool for dissecting the association patterns within multidimensional contingency tables, allowing researchers to examine interactions and conditional independence among three or more categorical variables by analyzing the structure of expected cell frequencies [4]. Simultaneously, the increasing use of continuous variables spurred the wider adoption of regression models and correlation analysis. Regression provided a framework to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, quantifying the direction and magnitude of associations while statistically controlling for other predictors. This marked a key step towards analyzing more complex relationships and handling continuous data [4].​

Within correlation analysis, classical measures quantify the degree to which variables co-vary, typically ranging from -1 to $+ 1$ [28]. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient $( r \ )$ is a widely used bivariate measure quantifying the strength and direction of a linearrelationship between two continuous variables [5,26]. Its interpretation is standard: values closer to $+ 1$ or -1 indicate stronger positive or negative linear associations, respectively, while 0 suggests no linear relationship [5]. A higher absolute value of $r$ suggests that a linear model provides a more reliable fit to the data. However, Pearson's $r$ assumes linearity and is sensitive to outliers. Consequently, non-parametric alternatives like Spearman's rank correlation are often employed when the relationship is monotonic but not necessarily linear, or when data may contain outliers, as it assesses the correlation between the ranks of the two variables rather than their raw values [26].  

Moving beyond bivariate relationships, multivariate correlation coefficients like multiple correlation and partial correlation became essential tools, particularly in the context of regression and control for confounders [26]. Multiple correlation assesses the collective linear association between a single dependent variable and a set of independent variables, indicating how well the dependent variable can be predicted by the group of predictors combined. Partial correlation, conversely, quantifies the linear relationship between two specific variables while statistically removing the influence of one or more other variables [26]. These multivariate extensions allowed for a more nuanced understanding of relationships in settings involving multiple interacting factors, a common scenario in social science research and beyond.  

# 2.1 Historical Statistical Methods (Social Sciences context)  

The statistical methodologies employed in social science research have undergone a significant evolution, driven by increasing data complexity and more sophisticated research questions. Beginning in the late 1940s, social science, particularly sociology, heavily relied on simple cross-tabulations to examine relationships between categorical variables [4].  

During this period, there was also substantial intellectual investment in developing measures of association suitable for various types of categorical data, alongside initial work on log-linear models [4].  

This era is notable for the significant contributions made by sociology to the broader field of statistics itself [4].  

As social scientists sought to move beyond simple bivariate relationships and understand the interplay of multiple factors, methods capable of handling conditional relationships became necessary. Log-linear models emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing the association patterns among three or more categorical variables, allowing researchers to test for interactions and conditional independence. These models analyze the structure of contingency tables by examining the logarithms of expected cell frequencies, providing insights into how variables are associated while controlling for others. For instance, in studying social mobility, log-linear models could explore how the association between parental occupation and offspring occupation varies across different educational levels.​  

Simultaneously, the increasing availability of continuous or interval-level data and the growing interest in causal modeling led to the wider adoption and development of regression analysis. Linear regression, for example, allows researchers to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables, quantifying the magnitude and direction of these relationships while holding other predictors constant. This capability to control for confounding variables represented a major leap forward from simple cross-tabulations. Regression models have been extensively applied to study topics such as wage inequality, predicting earnings based on education, experience, and other demographic factors, while accounting for the effects of multiple predictors simultaneously. Unlike cross-tabulations which are primarily suited for categorical data, regression techniques can accommodate a mix of continuous and categorical predictors and continuous outcomes (in the case of linear regression), offering greater flexibility.  

The assumptions underlying these methods differ. Cross-tabulations often rely on assumptions about independence when conducting statistical tests like the chi-square test. Log-linear models assume the data fit a specific model structure describing the associations among variables, typically analyzed under the assumption of a Poisson or multinomial distribution for cell counts. Regression models, particularly standard linear regression, assume linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity, and often normality of errors for inference. Interpretation also varies: cross-tabulations yield percentages and simple measures of association, log-linear models provide insights into odds ratios and interaction structures, and regression offers coefficients representing the estimated change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in a predictor.​  

By the 1960s, the field saw a further shift with a greater focus on individual-level survey data and the development of more complex causal modeling frameworks like Linear Structural Relations (LISREL) and methods for analyzing time-dependent data such as event history analysis [4]. This progression reflected the desire for more robust causal inferences and the ability to model dynamic processes. As data became even more diverse by the late 1980s, encompassing text, narratives, social networks, and spatially referenced information, the limitations of traditional methods like cross-tabulations, standard regression, and log-linear models for these new data types became apparent, necessitating the development of entirely new statistical approaches [4]. However, the evolution from simple cross-tabulations to the widespread use of regression and log-linear models marked a crucial phase in social science statistics, enabling researchers to tackle increasingly complex questions with greater rigor.​  

# 2.2 Classical Bivariate and Multivariate Measures  

Correlation coefficients represent a class of classical measures quantifying the degree to which two variables co-vary [28]. These measures typically range from -1 to $+ 1$ , where $+ 1$ indicates a perfect positive relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship, and 0 signifies no linear relationship [5,28].  

Within this domain, a fundamental distinction exists between bivariate and multivariate measures of association. Bivariate measures, such as Pearson's and Spearman's correlation coefficients, assess the relationship between only two variables at a time. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, often denoted as "r", is a widely used bivariate measure [26]. It specifically quantifies the strength and direction of a linearrelationship between two continuous variables. The interpretation of Pearson's "r" values is well-defined:  

$\mathsf { r } = + 1$ indicates a perfect positive linear correlation, r between 0 and $+ 1$ indicates a positive linear correlation, $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { r } } = 0$ suggests no linear correlation, r between 0 and $^ { - 1 }$ indicates a negative linear correlation, and $\mathsf { r } = - 1$ represents a perfect negative linear correlation [5].  

Pearson's correlation is sensitive to outliers and assumes that the data meet certain conditions, including linearity. In contrast, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (mentioned in the subsection description) is a non-parametric alternative that assesses the strength and direction of a monotonicrelationship between two variables, making it more suitable for nonlinear but monotonic associations and less sensitive to outliers compared to Pearson's.​  

Moving beyond bivariate analysis, multivariate measures consider the relationships involving more than two variables. Two important multivariate correlation coefficients are multiple correlation and partial correlation [26]. Multiple correlation measures the combined degree of association between a single dependent variable and a set of multiple independent variables. It quantifies how well the dependent variable can be predicted by the entire set of predictors simultaneously. Partial correlation, on the other hand, quantifies the relationship between two specific variables while statistically controlling for the influence of one or more other variables [26,32]. This allows researchers to isolate the unique association between the two variables of interest and remove the confounding effects of the controlled variables.​  

In practical use, bivariate measures like Pearson's are valuable for initial explorations of pair-wise linear relationships, while Spearman's is preferred when linearity is not assumed or when outliers are present. Multivariate measures like multiple and partial correlation are essential in regression analysis and complex modeling, as they allow for the assessment of collective predictive power and the understanding of direct relationships net of confounders. Limitations include Pearson's assumption of linearity and its sensitivity to outliers, whereas multivariate methods require careful consideration of underlying assumptions and potential multicollinearity among predictors—standard considerations in their application.  

# 3. Information-Theoretic Measures of Association  

![](images/95fa3834ea56affc37d3869d891c3e936b4a8ee0f4149d46defe7103352a8247.jpg)  

Information-theoretic measures provide a powerful and versatile framework for quantifying statistical associations between variables, offering significant advantages over traditional methods, particularly in their ability to capture complex, nonlinear dependencies that linear correlation measures may miss [9,14,29]. Rooted in the principles of information theory, these measures quantify the reduction in uncertainty about one variable gained by observing another [14,29].​  

![](images/10d122ee413b6ef49bd9f0fa0cc889163f308af86f44a0f3e715f91795322767.jpg)  

The foundational concepts include entropy, which quantifies the inherent uncertainty of a random variable, and mutual information, which measures the shared information or statistical dependence between variables [14,29]. Mutual information, ${ | ( \sf X ; Y ) }$ , between two variables X and Y can be formally defined using their joint probability $\mathsf { p } ( \mathsf { x } , \mathsf { y } )$ and marginal probabilities ${ \mathsf p } ( \mathsf { x } )$ and $\mathsf { p } ( \mathsf { y } )$ as:​  

$$
I ( X ; Y ) = \sum _ { x , y } p ( x , y ) \log { \frac { p ( x , y ) } { p ( x ) p ( y ) } }
$$  

or equivalently in terms of the entropies H(X), H(Y) and the conditional entropies H(X|Y), H(Y|X):  

$$
I ( X ; Y ) = H ( X ) - H ( X | Y ) = H ( Y ) - H ( Y | X )
$$  

These measures are distinct from linear correlation and are capable of revealing a wider range of associations [14,29]. More advanced frameworks, such as Partial Information Decomposition (PID), further extend this capability by decomposing the mutual information into unique, redundant, and synergistic components, offering deeper insights into how information is integrated and shared among multiple variables [1,7].​  

Despite their theoretical elegance and analytical power, the practical application of information-theoretic measures, especially in high-dimensional settings, faces computational challenges related to accurately estimating probabilities and distributions [14,23]. Addressing the curse of dimensionality, recent advancements in estimation techniques utilize transforms such as multivariate iterative Gaussianization via algorithms like RBIG. This approach simplifies the estimation process by decomposing the problem into sequences of marginal operations, significantly improving computational efficiency and estimation accuracy in high dimensions [23].​  

Furthermore, assessing the statistical significance of observed associations quantified by these measures is crucial. Permutation testing is a widely adopted non-parametric method for significance analysis, involving the comparison of the observed measure against a null distribution generated by permuting data labels [9]. However, the naive implementation, particularly for measures derived from count data, can be computationally prohibitive due to the repeated reconstruction of count tables [9]. Optimized techniques have been developed to mitigate this, such as directly transforming count tables based on principles like the hypergeometric distribution, thereby accelerating the permutation testing process [9].​  

The versatility of information-theoretic measures is demonstrated in various applications. A notable area is the comparison and evaluation of data clusterings [29]. Measures like Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Variation of Information (VI) provide robust ways to quantify the agreement or divergence between different partitioning schemes, offering valuable external validation metrics for clustering algorithms [29]. NMI measures the normalized shared information between clusterings U and V:  

$$
N M I ( U , V ) = \frac { I ( U ; V ) } { \sqrt { H ( U ) H ( V ) } }
$$  

while VI quantifies the total information loss or gain, serving as a metric distance:  

$$
V I ( U , V ) = H ( U | V ) + H ( V | U )
$$  

These applications highlight the practical utility of information-theoretic measures in understanding complex data structures and relationships [29].  

In summary, information-theoretic measures provide a sophisticated toolkit for analyzing associations, capable of capturing non-linearities and complex dependencies. Ongoing research continues to refine estimation techniques and significance testing methods to make these powerful tools more computationally accessible and applicable across diverse scientific domains, from quantifying dependencies in biological data to comparing clustering outcomes [9,23,29].​  

# 3.1 Core Concepts and Measures  

Information theory provides fundamental measures for quantifying uncertainty and the relationships between random variables, serving as a basis for various measures of association—particularly in capturing non-linear dependencies [14]. A cornerstone concept is entropy, which quantifies the uncertainty associated with a random variable or process [14]. For a discrete random variable X with probability mass function ${ \mathsf p } ( \mathsf { x } )$ , the Shannon entropy H(X) is formally defined as:​  

$$
H ( X ) = - \sum _ { x \in X } p ( x ) \log p ( x )
$$  

This value represents the average number of bits required to describe the outcome of X and can be interpreted as a measure of its inherent uncertainty [7,29]. A higher entropy indicates greater uncertainty, as illustrated by the example that a fair coin flip has lower entropy than a die roll due to having fewer possible outcomes [14].  

Building upon entropy, mutual information quantifies the amount of information shared between two random variables, measuring their statistical dependence [14]. For two discrete random variables X and Y, their mutual information I(X;Y) is defined as:​  

$$
I ( X ; Y ) = \sum _ { x \in X , y \in Y } p ( x , y ) \log { \frac { p ( x , y ) } { p ( x ) p ( y ) } }
$$  

where $\mathsf { p } ( \mathsf { x } , \mathsf { y } )$ is the joint probability mass function and ${ \sf p } ( { \sf x } )$ and $\mathsf { p } ( \mathsf { y } )$ are the marginal probability mass functions [29]. Mutual information can also be expressed in terms of entropy and conditional entropy ${ \mathsf { H } } ( { \mathsf { X } } | { \mathsf { Y } } )$ :  

$$
I ( X ; Y ) = H ( X ) - H ( X | Y )
$$  

where the conditional entropy ${ \mathsf { H } } ( { \mathsf { X } } | { \mathsf { Y } } )$ , which quantifies the remaining uncertainty about X after observing Y, is defined as:  

$$
H ( X | Y ) = - \sum _ { x \in X , y \in Y } p ( x , y ) \log p ( x | y )
$$  

with $\mathsf { p } ( \mathsf { x } | \mathsf { y } )$ being the conditional probability of X given Y [29]. Thus, mutual information represents the reduction in uncertainty about one variable obtained by knowing the other [29]. Other related information-theoretic measures include the joint entropy H(X,Y) and the multi-information $( \Omega )$ , defined for multiple variables (e.g., three variables $X _ { 1 } , X _ { 2 } , X _ { 3 } )$ ) as $\Omega = - H _ { 1 2 3 } + \sum _ { i } H _ { i } ,$  

where $\mathsf { H } \boxtimes$ is the entropy of each individual variable and $\mathsf { H } _ { 1 2 3 }$ is their joint entropy [9,14]. These measures are utilized to quantify dependencies in various applications, such as analyzing dependencies between SNPs and phenotypes [9] or comparing data clusterings by assessing the uncertainty reduction.​  

Information-theoretic measures like mutual information are distinct from traditional correlation measures such as Pearson correlation. While Pearson correlation specifically measures linear relationships between two variables, mutual information captures general statistical dependence, including non-linear associations [14,29]. Furthermore, frameworks like Partial Information Decomposition (PID) extend the analysis by decomposing the mutual information between a target variable and a set of source variables into unique, redundant, and synergistic components [1]. This decomposition reveals different ways information is shared: unique information from a single source, redundant information present in multiple sources, and synergistic information arising from the joint contribution of multiple sources that is not available from any source alone [1]. Similarly, causality can be decomposed using entropy and mutual information concepts into redundant, unique, and synergistic causal contributions [7]. This ability to dissect complex dependencies into distinct components is a significant advantage over standard correlation coefficients, which primarily quantify the overall strength and direction of a linear relationship. The application of these concepts extends to quantifying causal influence and emergence in complex systems [1].​  ​  

# 3.2 Estimation Techniques  

Estimating information-theoretic measures directly, particularly in high-dimensional spaces, presents significant challenges due to the exponential growth in data complexity with increasing dimensionality, often referred to as the curse of dimensionality. Addressing this, recent research has explored indirect estimation techniques that transform the problem into a more tractable form. One such approach leverages multivariate iterative Gaussianization transforms to simplify the estimation of multivariate information-theoretic measures [23]. This method utilizes algorithms like Reversible Independent Component Analysis through Gaussianization (RBIG), which decomposes the complex multivariate estimation problem into a sequence of simpler marginal operations applied iteratively [23]. At each iteration of the Gaussianization process, the multivariate data is transformed, and the required measures can be related to operations performed on the resulting marginal distributions. This transformation strategy significantly impacts computational efficiency and aids in handling the curse of dimensionality. Specifically, by reducing the problem to marginal estimations, the global error of the estimation procedure can depend linearly on the number of calls to the marginal estimator, effectively mitigating the detrimental effects of high dimensionality on estimation accuracy and computational cost compared to methods that require explicit modeling or dense sampling of the high-dimensional joint distribution [23].​  

# 3.3 Significance Analysis (Permutation Testing)  

Assessing the statistical significance of an observed measure of association is crucial to distinguish true relationships from those arising by chance. Permutation testing is a widely employed non-parametric method for this purpose. The core principle involves constructing a null distribution of the test statistic by repeatedly re-calculating the measure after randomly shuffling the labels of one variable relative to the other. This generates a distribution representing the measure’s value under the null hypothesis of no association, against which the observed value can be compared to determine its significance.​  

In the context of analyzing measures of association, particularly those derived from contingency tables or count data, the naive application of permutation testing presents a significant computational challenge [9]. The conventional approach necessitates re-running the complete analysis pipeline for each permuted dataset. This includes the computationally intensive step of reconstructing the count tables from the permuted data at every iteration [9]. Given the large number of permutations typically required for accurate significance assessment (often thousands or tens of thousands), this repeated reconstruction of count tables constitutes a major computational bottleneck, rendering the naive method prohibitively slow for large datasets or complex analyses.  

To mitigate this computational burden, optimized techniques have been developed that circumvent the need for full data permutation and subsequent count table reconstruction [9]. One such approach focuses on directly transforming the existing count table [9]. Instead of shuffling the original data and rebuilding the table, this method directly generates a randomized count table, denoted as $C ^ { * }$ , from the observed count table $C$ [9]. This randomization is performed based on principles derived from the hypergeometric distribution, which models sampling without replacement [9]. By operating directly on the count table representation, these optimized methods substantially reduce the computational overhead associated with permutation testing for count-based measures of association, offering a more efficient route to significance analysis.  

# 3.4 Applications (Cluster Comparison)  

Information-theoretic measures provide a principled framework for quantifying the similarity or dissimilarity between different clusterings of a dataset [29]. This capability is particularly valuable for evaluating the performance of clustering algorithms, comparing the results obtained from distinct methodologies, and assessing the stability and reliability of clustering outcomes [29]. Instead of relying solely on internal validation metrics that measure cluster cohesion and separation, external validation metrics like those derived from information theory allow for comparison against a ground truth partitioning or between the outputs of different algorithms on the same data [29].  

Several information-theoretic measures are employed for this purpose [29]. Two prominent examples discussed in the literature are Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and Variation of Information (VI) [29].  

Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) quantifies the mutual dependence between two different clusterings, typically scaled to lie between 0 and 1. Given two clusterings, U and V, the NMI score is commonly defined as:  

$$
N M I ( U , V ) = \frac { I ( U ; V ) } { \sqrt { H ( U ) H ( V ) } }
$$  

In this formula, $I ( U ; V )$ represents the mutual information between clusterings U and V, while $H ( U )$ and $H ( V )$ denote their respective entropies [29]. A higher NMI score indicates greater similarity between the two clusterings, with a value of 1 signifying perfect agreement (up to permutation of cluster labels) and a value of 0 suggesting that the clusterings are independent [29].  

In contrast, the Variation of Information (VI) measures the total amount of information lost or gained when transitioning from one clustering to another [29]. It is defined as the sum of the conditional entropies of one clustering given the other, which can also be expressed in terms of entropy and mutual information:​  

$$
V I ( U , V ) = H ( U | V ) + H ( V | U ) = H ( U ) + H ( V ) - 2 I ( U ; V )
$$  

Unlike NMI, VI is a metric distance, meaning it satisfies properties like non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry, and the triangle inequality. A lower VI score indicates greater similarity between the clusterings, with a value of 0 signifying perfect agreement [29].  

These information-theoretic measures offer a robust and interpretable means to compare clusterings by quantifying the shared information and the divergences between them, thereby facilitating rigorous evaluation and comparison in clustering tasks [29].​

Measures of association play a pivotal role in genomics and omics data analysis, serving as fundamental tools for identifying relationships between genetic variations and phenotypic traits or diseases. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), a prominent application, systematically scan the genome to pinpoint genetic variants, such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), statistically linked to traits of interest [3,31]. While traditional GWAS often relies on single-locus approaches, assessing the association of individual variants [3,20], the complexity of many traits arises from intricate interactions between multiple genetic loci (epistasis) and gene–environment factors [3,21]. Single-locus analysis is inherently limited in its capacity to capture these complex interactions, necessitating the development and application of multi-locus analysis methods [3,9].​  

Investigating multi-locus interactions, however, introduces significant computational challenges, primarily due to the combinatorial explosion of potential marker combinations that need to be evaluated [9,20]. Common statistical methods employed in GWAS, such as linear and logistic regression, provide the statistical framework for association testing [3]. However, these methods often rely on assumptions, like the independence of observations, which are frequently violated by population structure and relatedness in study cohorts. Mixed models are widely adopted to address these issues by incorporating random effects to account for sample relationships, although other assumptions still require consideration [3,20]. Furthermore, the large number of tests performed in GWAS necessitates rigorous multiple testing correction procedures to control the false positive rate [9].​  

The computational burden, particularly in multi-locus analysis with steps like count table construction and permutation testing, remains a significant hurdle [9]. Research efforts are directed towards developing efficient algorithms and optimization techniques, including adaptive permutation strategies and direct transformation methods for count tables, to enhance computational tractability [9]. Various computationally efficient multi-locus GWAS methods have also been proposed and utilized [20].  

These analytical approaches find diverse applications across genomics. In agricultural genomics, GWAS and genomic selection are applied to improve complex agronomic traits in crops like maize, utilizing methods such as BLINK, FarmCPU, mrMLM, GBLUP, and RKHS [20]. In human genetics, studies are expanding to include diverse populations, investigating rare/structural variants, optimizing polygenic risk scores, and exploring gene-environment interactions to gain a more comprehensive understanding of disease architecture [3,12]. A key trend is the integration of multi-omics data – including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics – to provide a holistic view of biological systems and identify causal mechanisms [3]. This integration presents challenges related to data heterogeneity and high dimensionality, leading to the development of specialized tools like Gencube for data integration and sTPLS for identifying correlated patterns across conditions [21]. Throughout these endeavors, bioinformatics plays an indispensable role, providing the necessary computational infrastructure, tools, and databases for handling, integrating, and interpreting the vast amounts of omics data generated [31]. This section will delve into these aspects, outlining the current landscape of association measures and their applications in genomics and multi-omics analysis.​  

# 4.1 Application in GWAS and Multi-Locus Analysis  

Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) serve as a fundamental approach in genetics to identify genetic variants associated with specific traits or diseases [3,31]. The core principle involves assessing the statistical association between markers across the genome and the phenotype of interest. Traditionally, GWAS often relies on single-locus analysis, examining the association of individual genetic variants (such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, SNPs) with the trait [3,20].​  

However, many complex traits are not governed by single genes but rather influenced by intricate interactions between multiple genes (epistasis) and between genes and environmental factors [3,21]. Single-locus analysis inherently possesses limitations in capturing these complex interactions, potentially missing significant genetic effects that only become apparent when multiple loci are considered simultaneously [3,9]. This inadequacy of single-locus methods motivates the necessity for multi-locus analysis.  

Multi-locus analysis, including the investigation of SNP–SNP and gene–environment interactions, aims to identify these synergistic effects that contribute to trait variation [3,21]. Detecting such interactions provides a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture underlying complex traits [20]. Despite its potential, multi-locus analysis presents significant challenges, primarily due to the sheer computational scale of evaluating combinatorial effects [9,20]. Assessing interactions among all possible combinations of loci leads to a combinatorial explosion, necessitating efficient computational strategies. For instance, identifying epistatic (gene–gene) interactions that single-locus analyses often miss requires tackling the challenge of combinatorial testing inherent in multi-locus analysis [9].  

Addressing these computational complexities involves developing specialized methods and tools. Some research focuses on optimizing statistical testing procedures, such as permutation testing, to make the combinatorial search space more manageable [9]. Furthermore, tools designed for integrating and analyzing multi-omics data are crucial, as gene–gene and gene–environment interactions often involve complex relationships best understood through a holistic view of biological data [21]. Specific multi-locus GWAS (MGWAS) methods have been developed and applied to dissect the genetic architecture of traits in various organisms, explicitly addressing these combinatorial challenges [20]. Beyond interaction detection, leveraging external information and accounting for population structure also enhance power. Transfer learning methods, for example, can increase the power of conditional testing by incorporating prior information from external datasets, addressing the need to account for genetic variation associated with diverse ancestries in GWAS [12]. Thus, while multi-locus analysis is essential for fully unraveling the genetic basis of complex traits, its effective implementation is heavily dependent on overcoming substantial computational and methodological hurdles.  

# 4.2 Statistical Methods in GWAS  

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) commonly employ statistical methods to identify associations between genetic variants (such as SNPs) and phenotypic traits. For quantitative traits, linear regression models are frequently utilized to test for associations, assuming a linear relationship between the genetic marker and the trait value. For binary or categorical traits, logistic regression models are typically applied to assess the association by modeling the probability of belonging to a particular category based on genetic variation. These regression‐based approaches serve as foundational tools for association testing in GWAS, and their application is implicitly recognized as a key area within the field [3].  

While standard regression models are straightforward, their fundamental assumption of independent observations is often violated in GWAS due to the presence of population structure (differences in allele frequencies between subgroups) and relatedness among individuals in the study cohort. Failure to account for these factors can lead to inflated test statistics and spurious associations, resulting in a high rate of false positives. To mitigate these issues, mixed models have become indispensable in GWAS methodology. Mixed models incorporate both fixed effects, representing factors like genetic variants, covariates (e.g., age, sex), and population structure principal components, and random effects, which are used to model the covariance among individuals arising from relatedness. The inclusion of a kinship matrix or other relatedness measures in the random effects component allows the model to appropriately adjust for the non-independence of observations. The importance of mixed models in accounting for population structure and relatedness is acknowledged as a significant aspect of current GWAS research [3].​  

A common application of mixed models in association testing involves modeling complex genetic and environmental factors influencing the phenotype. For instance, in studies analyzing traits influenced by combining ability, a mixed model framework can be employed to partition variance and test associations. Such models incorporate fixed effects for grand mean, blocks, and environments, alongside random effects representing general combining ability (GCA) of parent lines and specific combining ability (SCA) of crosses, which capture different aspects of genetic contribution and interaction [20]. The structure of such a model for individual environments can be represented as:  

$$
y = \mu + B + G C A _ { L } + G C A _ { T } + S C A + \epsilon
$$  

And for combined environments, accounting for genotype–environment interactions:  

$$
y = \mu + B + E + G C A _ { L } + G C A _ { T } + S C A + G C A _ { L } \times E + G C A _ { T } \times E + S C A \times E + \epsilon
$$  

Here, $y$ is the phenotype, $\mu$ is the mean, $B$ is the block effect, $E$ is the environment effect, $G C A _ { L }$ ​ and $G C A _ { T }$ ​ are the general combining abilities for line and tester parents respectively, $S C A$ is the specific combining ability, and $\epsilon$ is the error term. These models estimate variance components for the various genetic and environmental effects and provide the statistical basis for conducting association tests between genetic markers and the trait, while simultaneously accounting for the complex relationships and structure within the data [20].  

Beyond population structure and relatedness, other assumptions of regression and mixed models, such as the normality of residuals (for linear models), homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), and linearity of relationships, are also critical. Violations of these assumptions can affect the validity of p-values and the power of association tests. While mixed models effectively handle correlation due to relatedness or structure, they are still susceptible to other issues like non-normality or complex non-linear relationships that are not adequately modeled. Alternative statistical approaches or non-parametric methods may be considered in such cases. For assessing the statistical significance of results obtained from these models, methods like permutation testing can be employed or optimized as an alternative to standard parametric inference [9].  

Furthermore, entirely different approaches like sTPLS are being explored for analyzing complex multi-omics data in the context of GWAS, moving beyond traditional univariate association testing [21].  

# 4.3 Computational Challenges and Solutions in GWAS  

The application of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to increasingly large datasets and the analysis of complex genetic architectures, such as those involving multiple loci, impose significant computational burdens [3]. The sheer number of statistical tests performed across millions of genetic variants necessitates high algorithmic efficiency and often requires advanced computing infrastructures, including distributed computing frameworks [3]. A major bottleneck in multilocus GWAS, in particular, is the exponential increase in computational cost associated with the construction of count tables and the execution of permutation testing [9]. These steps are crucial for accurately assessing the significance of associations but become prohibitively expensive as the complexity of the models increases.​  

To mitigate these challenges, researchers have developed various techniques and computational frameworks. One approach involves employing diverse and computationally efficient multi-locus GWAS (MGWAS) methods. Studies utilize multiple such methods, including BLINK, FarmCPU, mrMLM, FASTmrMLM, FASTmrEMMA, pLARmEB, and ISIS EM-BLASSO, to efficiently scan a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome, thus handling the inherent computational scale of the data [20].​  

A more direct approach to address the bottleneck of permutation testing and count table construction involves algorithmic optimizations. One proposed solution focuses on directly transforming count tables to emulate a permutation test, a technique that significantly reduces computation time compared to traditional direct permutation methods [9]. A key advantage of this optimized approach is that its computation time does not depend on the number of samples, which is a critical limitation of direct permutation methods when dealing with large cohorts [9]. This illustrates how algorithmic innovation at specific steps, like permutation testing, can yield substantial efficiency gains. Furthermore, handling highdimensional data, a challenge also prominent in multi-omics integration, necessitates solutions that improve data accessibility, standardization, and analytical capabilities [21]. Platforms like Gencube and sTPLS exemplify such solutions designed to alleviate general computational bottlenecks in large-scale biological data analysis [21]. Additionally, managing the large number of tests performed in GWAS requires careful consideration of multiple testing correction, often addressed by employing stringent significance thresholds [20]. Collectively, these efforts underscore the ongoing need for methodological and computational advancements to enable comprehensive and efficient GWAS analysis.  

# 4.4 Specific Applications in Genomics  

Association studies and genomic selection play a critical role in advancing our understanding of complex biological traits and informing breeding and therapeutic strategies. Bioinformatics serves as a foundational support system for analyzing the vast amounts of data generated in these omics‐driven investigations, providing the necessary tools and databases [31].  

In agricultural genomics, these approaches are directly applied to improve crop traits. For instance, research in maize has utilized genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection to enhance agronomic characteristics [20]. A study focusing on a specific maize population (537 hybrid combinations derived from an NCII genetic mating design) provided insights into the genetic architecture underlying the general combining ability (GCA) for traits such as kernel row number, kernel length, and kernel width within a Chinese genetic context [20]. The research further explored the impact of integrating significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified through multi-locus GWAS (MGWAS) as fixed effects into genomic prediction models, including GBLUP and RKHS, demonstrating approaches to potentially improve prediction accuracy [20].​  

Beyond agriculture, association studies are extensively applied in human populations to uncover genetic contributions to diseases and traits. Recent trends in China and elsewhere highlight the growing focus on conducting GWAS in diverse, nonEuropean populations across Africa, Asia, and Latin America [3]. This emphasis addresses the critical issue of genetic background heterogeneity and aims to enhance the discovery of novel loci that may be population-specific or have different effect sizes in varied genetic contexts [3]. Efforts are also concentrated on optimizing Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) to mitigate population bias and improve prediction accuracy, particularly in non-European groups [3]. Transfer learning methods have shown promise in analyzing data from minority populations in datasets like the UK Biobank, enabling the discovery of more associations and potentially leading to more accurate PRS for these groups [12]. Furthermore, these studies are moving beyond common variants to investigate the contribution of low-frequency (minor allele frequency $0 . 1 \mathrm { - } 1 \%$ ) and structural variants through whole-genome sequencing [3]. The integration of gene–environment interactions $( \mathsf { G } \times \mathsf { E } )$ , incorporating data on lifestyle, microbiome, and pollutants, represents another significant avenue to comprehensively understand complex traits [3].​  

A key challenge in modern genomics is the integration of diverse multi-omics datasets, including epigenomics (ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq), transcriptomics (eQTL, scRNA-seq), proteomics (pQTL), and metabolomics, to pinpoint causal variants and elucidate underlying biological mechanisms [3]. This integration is crucial for a holistic view of biological systems. Tools like Gencube and sTPLS have been developed to address this challenge [21]. sTPLS, for example, facilitates the identification of gene–drug co-modules in cancer cell lines, providing a basis for drug repositioning and combination strategies [21]. It also aids in revealing common regulatory networks and specific molecular pathways from single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data, offering insights for autoimmune diseases and vaccine design [21]. Additionally, sTPLS has been applied to analyze communication co-modules in single-cell data from COVID-19 patient airways, identifying common and specific signaling pathway alterations across disease severity levels [21]. Three-dimensional genome technology is also being employed to understand how non-coding variations influence gene expression by regulating remote chromatin interactions, further emphasizing the need for integrated analytical approaches [3]. These advancements underscore the pivotal role of sophisticated computational tools and bioinformatics in navigating the complexity of omics data to drive biological discovery and application [31].​

Time series analysis is a fundamental domain focusing on data points ordered in time. Understanding the underlying patterns, associations between different series, and identifying deviations or anomalies are crucial for various applications, including finance, economics, and engineering. Basic time series components typically include trend, seasonality, and  

residual noise [2,25]. Anomalies, which represent significant deviations from expected patterns, can manifest in various forms, such as local point extremes, periodic irregularities, or disharmonious interactions between variables, whether synchronous or asynchronous [16]. Analyzing associations between time series, often referred to as measuring interdependence, is vital for understanding dynamic systems.​  

Various methods have been developed for time series analysis, particularly for anomaly detection. Traditional statistical approaches provide foundational techniques. The AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is a prominent method for modeling time series and forecasting future values. Anomaly detection using ARIMA is achieved by comparing observed values to predictions; deviations exceeding a defined threshold, often based on confidence intervals, are flagged as anomalies [25]. However, ARIMA models typically assume stationarity or require differencing to achieve it, which can be a limitation [25]. Simpler statistical tests like the z-score, which measures deviation from the mean in terms of standard deviations, and moving averages, which smooth data to identify significant departures, also provide interpretable criteria for anomaly detection [2].​  

In addition to statistical methods, machine learning techniques offer alternative paradigms by learning complex patterns within the data. Unsupervised algorithms like Isolation Forest detect anomalies by isolating data points that are few and distinct from the majority [2]. Deep learning models such as LSTM autoencoders are trained to reconstruct normal sequences; anomalies are identified when reconstruction errors are high, indicating a poor fit to the learned normal pattern [2]. These methods can capture non-linear relationships and dependencies that might be challenging for traditional statistical models. Information theory principles have also been found useful in the context of anomaly detection [14].  

More advanced techniques focus on capturing intricate dependencies and leveraging different data representations for improved anomaly detection. Analyzing time series in the frequency domain can reveal patterns not apparent in the time domain. Methods utilizing frequency domain processing, such as the Frequency Domain Rectifier (FDR), can filter noise and preserve underlying structures by selectively processing frequency components, often using transformations like the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and its inverse (iFFT) [16]. Furthermore, explicitly modeling complex inter-variable and asynchronous dependencies is crucial, especially in multivariate time series [16]. Approaches like Comprehensive Dependency-aware Attention (CDA) are designed to capture these relationships efficiently, for instance, by calculating attention scores between elements and their crisscross counterparts, unifying them to model comprehensive dependencies [16]. This contrasts with traditional attention mechanisms which may be computationally expensive for long sequences.  

Time series analysis finds numerous applications across various fields. One significant application involves testing for economic convergence, which assesses whether economic outputs of different regions or countries tend to converge over time [8]. This often involves analyzing the long-term relationship between non-stationary time series using concepts like cointegration and cotrending [8]. A novel test for economic convergence has been proposed based on the presence of positive cointegration and cotrending, utilizing a sequential procedure that first tests for cointegration without explicitly estimating the relationship, followed by a test for cotrending [8]. The test statistic relates to the squared difference between standardized series, formulated as:​  

$$
\widehat { D } _ { T } = \frac { 1 } { T } \sum _ { t = 1 } ^ { T } \left( y _ { i t } - y _ { j t } \right) ^ { 2 } = 2 \left( 1 - \hat { \rho } _ { i j } \right) ,
$$  

where $y _ { i t }$ ​ and $y _ { j t }$ ​ are standardized unit root processes and $\hat { \rho } _ { i j }$ ​ is the sample correlation between detrended processes [8]. The distribution of this statistic under the null hypothesis is approximated using a bootstrap method involving residual construction, estimation of the long-run covariance matrix using estimators like the Newey–West estimator:​  

$$
\widehat { \Omega } = \frac { 1 } { T } \sum _ { t = 1 } ^ { T } \widehat { v } _ { t } \widehat { v } _ { t } ^ { \prime } + \frac { 1 } { T } \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { M - 1 } k _ { j } \sum _ { t = j + 1 } ^ { T } \left( \widehat { v } _ { t } \widehat { v } _ { t - j } ^ { \prime } + \widehat { v } _ { t - j } \widehat { v } _ { t } ^ { \prime } \right) ,
$$  

where $\widehat { \boldsymbol { v } } _ { t }$ ​ are estimated residuals and $k _ { j }$ ​ are weights [8]. Bootstrap methods are particularly beneficial for small sample sizes, offering more accurate approximations than asymptotic methods [8]. Evaluation through Monte Carlo simulations and empirical application demonstrates the test's practical utility [8]. This application highlights how measures of association, specifically cointegration and cotrending, can be rigorously tested within a time series framework to address significant economic questions.  

In summary, the analysis of measures in time series encompasses understanding fundamental components and anomaly types, applying a spectrum of methods from traditional statistical models like ARIMA and z-score to advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, including frequency domain and complex dependency modeling. These techniques are applied to detect anomalies and analyze associations, with specific applications like economic convergence testing demonstrating the practical relevance and ongoing development in the field. Current challenges include effectively capturing complex, non-linear, and asynchronous dependencies, particularly in multivariate series, and developing methods robust to noise and computational constraints. Future research directions point towards integrating advanced machine learning models with time-frequency analysis and improving the interpretability and theoretical guarantees of complex anomaly detection systems.  

# 5.1 Anomaly Detection Techniques  

Identifying anomalies in time series data is a critical task across various domains. Different methodologies have been developed, ranging from statistical approaches to sophisticated machine learning and deep learning models. One foundational approach utilizes the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. ARIMA models are primarily employed for forecasting future values, and anomaly detection is achieved by comparing observed data points against the values predicted by the fitted model. Deviations that significantly exceed a predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The determination of this threshold is crucial and is influenced by factors such as the desired confidence level, the distribution of errors, and the frequency of the data. Confidence intervals—typically a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval—are a common method for establishing this threshold, with observed values falling outside this range considered anomalous.  

# [25]​  

Beyond model-based forecasting methods like ARIMA, simpler statistical techniques are also widely applied. The z‑score is one such method, quantifying how many standard deviations an observation is away from the mean. Anomalies are identified as observations whose z‑scores surpass a specified threshold. Another straightforward technique involves moving averages, where anomalies are detected based on significant deviations from the calculated moving average of the data. These statistical methods provide interpretable criteria for anomaly identification based on the data’s inherent properties.  

# [2]  

Machine learning techniques offer alternative paradigms for anomaly detection by learning patterns within the data to identify deviations. For instance, Isolation Forest—an unsupervised algorithm—operates by randomly partitioning the data space to isolate anomalies, which, being fewer and different from normal instances, require fewer partitions to separate. Deep learning models, such as LSTM autoencoders, are also utilized. An LSTM autoencoder is trained to reconstruct normal time series sequences; anomalies are detected when the reconstruction error for an observed sequence exceeds a predefined threshold, indicating that the model struggled to accurately reconstruct the sequence and suggesting a significant deviation from learned normal patterns.  

More advanced techniques seek to capture complex relationships within time series data for improved anomaly detection One such approach introduces components like the Frequency Domain Rectifier (FDR) and Comprehensive Dependency‑aware Attention (CDA). The FDR module processes data in the frequency domain using a real Fast Fourier Transform, denoted as  

$$
{ \mathsf { H \_ f } } = \mathsf { i r F F T } ( { \mathsf { S e l } } ( { \mathsf { r F F T } } ( { \mathsf { H } } ) ) ) ,
$$  

where Sel selects the low‑frequency components, thereby filtering high‑frequency noise and preserving underlying patterns before transforming back via an inverse real FFT. The CDA module addresses the challenge of capturing dependencies with reduced computational cost by calculating attention scores between each element and its crisscross counterparts (i.e. elements in the same row and column) rather than all pairs. For an embedded multivariate time series $\mathsf { H } \in \bigstar \mathsf { N } ^ { \wedge } ( \mathsf { l } \times \mathsf { d } )$ , CDA computes attention scores for each element $\mathsf { q } \boxtimes \boxtimes \boxtimes \boxtimes$ in the query matrix Q as​  

$\mathsf { a \_ i } = \mathsf { s o f t m a x } ( \mathsf { q } \mathsf { E } \boxtimes \bigtriangledown \bigtriangledown \bigtriangledown \big \triangledown \mathsf { k \_ i } \bigtriangledown )$ and  a_j $\mathbf { \Sigma } = \mathbf { \Sigma }$ softmax(q₍ᵢⱼ₎ k_jᵀ), where ${ \sf k \_ i } \in \mathbb { X } ^ { \wedge } ( 1 \times { \mathsf d } )$ and ${ \sf k \_ j } \in \mathbb { X } ^ { \wedge } ( { \sf l } \times { \sf 1 } )$ are the row and column keys, respectively. These scores are then unified into a distribution via  

$$
\mathsf { a l Z } | \bigtriangledown , \bigtriangledown , \bigtriangledown | \bigtriangledown = \mathsf { s o f t m a x } ( \mathsf { c o n c a t } ( \mathsf { a \_ i } , \mathsf { a \_ j } ) ) ,
$$  

with “concat” denoting the concatenation operation. By effectively modeling these complex inter‑variable dependencies, such advanced methods aim to enhance the accuracy of identifying anomalous behaviors that manifest as deviations from  

learned dependency patterns.  

# 5.2 Applications (Economic Convergence Test)  

Time series methodologies are frequently employed to assess economic convergence among disparate regions or national economies. A key concept in this application is cointegration, which examines whether non-stationary time series maintain a long-term, stable relationship despite short-term fluctuations. Economic convergence, in this context, implies that the economic output time series of different entities tend to move together over the long run [8].​  

Specific tests have been developed for this purpose. One such approach proposes a novel test that defines economic convergence as the presence of positive cointegration and cotrending between economic output time series [8]. This novel test adopts a sequential procedure. Initially, it tests for the existence of positive cointegration without requiring the estimation of the cointegrating relationship. Subsequent to establishing positive cointegration, the methodology proceeds to test for cotrending [8].​  

The core of this test lies in its statistic, denoted as   
widehat $D _ { T } =$   
frac1T   
$s u m _ { t = 1 } ^ { T }$   
lef t(yit ​ − yjt ​   
$r i g h t ) ^ { 2 } = 2$   
lef t(1 −   
widehatrhoij   
right),  

where $y _ { i t }$ ​ and $y _ { j t }$ ​ are standardized unit root processes representing the economic output of two entities $\mathbf { \chi } _ { i }$ and $j$ at time $t$ , and ​widehatr $h o _ { i j }$ represents the sample correlation between the detrended processes [8]. This formulation effectively links the convergence test to the squared difference between the standardized series, which, for cointegrated unit root processes, is related to their correlation after detrending.  

To approximate the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis, the paper utilizes a bootstrap method [8]. The bootstrap algorithm involves several crucial steps: the construction of residuals, the estimation of the long-run covariance matrix ​widehatOmega using the Newey–West estimator, the generation of bootstrap error sequences, and the computation of the bootstrap test statistic [8]. The Newey–West estimator for the long-run covariance matrix is given by:  

widehatOmega $\underline { { \underline { { \mathbf { \Pi } } } } } = \underline { { \underline { { \mathbf { \Pi } } } } }$   
frac1T T   
sumt=1   
widehatvt   
widehatvtprime ​ +   
frac1T   
sumj=1 M −1 ​kj T   
sumt=j+1   
lef t(   
widehatvt   
widehatvtpr−ijme ​ +   
widehatvt−j​   
widehatvtprime ​   
right),  

where ​widehatvt​ are estimated residuals and $k _ { j }$ ​ are weights [8]. This bootstrap approach is particularly advantageous, especially in small sample sizes, as it can provide more accurate approximations of the test statistic's distribution compared to asymptotic methods. The performance and applicability of this novel test have been evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application analyzing GDP data from G7 countries, demonstrating its utility in practical economic analysis [8].  

# 6. Measures in Complex Systems and Causal Inference  

![](images/3749bfb27d7481935157bce73d9cb41852d3831300bdd26302fbcb3efb0b8b2d.jpg)  

Understanding the intricate relationships and dynamic behaviors within complex systems presents significant challenges for traditional analytical approaches. Complex systems are characterized by numerous interacting components that collectively give rise to emergent properties, where the system's macroscopic behavior is more than the simple sum of its parts [1,13]. Key properties include non-linearity, interdependence, multiscale structure, and operation potentially at the edge of order and disorder [1,6,13]. Due to these characteristics, traditional measures of association, often limited to capturing linear or pairwise relationships, are frequently insufficient [6,7,13]. The prevalence of non-linear dependencies, higher-order interactions leading to emergence, and the multiscale nature of these systems necessitate advanced measures capable of capturing such complexities and distinguishing true causal influences from mere correlations [1,6,7,13].  

Network analysis provides a foundational structural framework for modeling complex systems by representing entities as nodes and interactions as edges [13,22]. Social Network Analysis (SNA), for instance, models social structures based on connections between actors [22]. Characterizing these network structures involves fundamental metrics at both the global level (e.g., connectivity, density, diameter, average path length, clustering coefficient) and the individual node level (e.g., degree, betweenness, closeness centrality) [22]. Complex networks frequently exhibit specific properties like small-world characteristics and scale-free degree distributions [13]. These measures help in understanding the topology and identifying influential components within the system, applicable across diverse domains including Internet infrastructure [27].  

Moving beyond associative relationships to infer causality is crucial for understanding complex system dynamics. Causal discovery methods, particularly those based on graphical models, aim to learn causal structures from observational data [6].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Method Type</td><td>Core Principle</td><td>Key Assumption/ Requirement</td><td>Example Algorithms</td><td>Strengths</td><td>Weaknesses</td></tr><tr><td>based</td><td>structure from conditional independenc</td><td>Causal Markov Condition</td><td></td><td>Statistically rigorous, can handle cycles (FCI)</td><td>errors in independenc e tests</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>graph optimizing a score</td><td>scoring function (e.g., BIC)</td><td></td><td>to test errors</td><td>computation al cost (vast search</td></tr><tr><td>Models (FCMs)</td><td>= function of causes + independent noise</td><td>independenc e of cause and noise in causal</td><td></td><td>direction for non-linear relations</td><td>Model specification can be challenging</td></tr></table></body></html>  

These methods primarily fall into categories such as constraint-based approaches (like the PC and FCI algorithms, which infer structure from conditional independence tests), score-based methods (which search for graph structures optimizing a statistical score), and Functional Causal Models (FCMs) [6]. FCMs are particularly useful for non-linear relationships, modeling effects as a function of causes plus independent noise (displayed below) and leveraging the independence property between cause and noise in the causal direction to infer directionality [6].  

$$
Y = f ( X ) + N
$$  

Applying these methods to complex systems may require specialized techniques to handle challenges like potential cyclic structures and cross-level causality [1].  

A specific aspect of complex system causality is the concept of causal emergence, which describes how causal relationships at macroscopic scales can differ from and potentially be stronger than those at microscopic scales [1]. Quantitative theories for causal emergence include Erik Hoel's approach using Effective Information (EI) to compare causality across different scales, and Fernando E. Rosas' theory employing Partial Information Decomposition (PID) to quantify synergistic information as an indicator of emergent causality [1]. These theories offer distinct perspectives on identifying and quantifying emergent causal phenomena.​  

To dissect complex multivariate causal relationships, the Synergistic, Unique, and Redundant Decomposition of Causality (SURD) framework provides a novel approach [7]. SURD decomposes the information flow from multiple sources to a target variable into redundant, unique, synergistic, and causality leak components [7]. Redundant causality captures shared information among sources, unique causality represents the contribution from a single source not available elsewhere, synergistic causality quantifies the information gained only by observing multiple sources together, and causality leak accounts for the influence of unobserved variables [7]. This decomposition offers a finer-grained understanding compared to pairwise measures and directly addresses aspects like the influence of hidden variables, relevant for handling confounding [7]. Benchmarking studies reportedly demonstrate SURD's efficacy in detecting causal relationships, including those with complex dependencies like multiple variables, different time lags, and instantaneous links [7]. The focus on synergy in SURD aligns with concepts explored in PID for characterizing causal emergence [1].​  

The analytical tools and concepts discussed find practical application in understanding diverse complex phenomena. In Internet measurement and analysis, network analysis helps map infrastructure and understand traffic patterns, while measures of association aid in network security and management, such as identifying patterns indicative of attacks [27]. Furthermore, in complex technological ecosystems like Agriculture 4.0, characterized by interconnected IoT devices and various technologies, these measures support cybersecurity efforts [18]. Machine learning-based intrusion detection systems leverage association patterns to identify anomalies or intrusions within these networks, highlighting the role of sophisticated measures in securing complex, large-scale deployments despite context-specific challenges [18]. These applications underscore the critical role of advanced measures of association, network analysis, and causal inference in navigating the complexities of modern systems.​  

# 6.1 Defining Complex Systems and Association Challenges  

Complex systems are characterized by interacting units that collectively exhibit emergent properties, meaning the macroscopic behavior and characteristics cannot be simply attributed to the individual components [1,13]. This principle is often summarized as "the whole is more than the sum of its parts" [13]. Such systems frequently involve numerous variables and are defined by properties including emergence, nonlinearity, interdependence, and multiscale structure [1,6,13]. They often operate at the edge of order and disorder and display long-range correlations, where reductionist approaches that focus solely on individual elements without considering their interactions become inappropriate due to the lack of a characteristic scale [13]. Interaction networks are fundamental to describing how elements within these systems connect and influence each other, with network properties such as small-world or scale-free structures reflecting the system's complexity [13]. Examples of complex systems span diverse fields, including social networks, which comprise interconnected actors with complex relationships [22], the Internet, facing challenges in measurement and analysis under large-scale dynamics [27], and modern technological ecosystems like Agriculture 4.0, integrating various emerging technologies and confronting security and privacy challenges in large-scale deployments [18].​  

Analyzing the intricate relationships and dynamics within these complex systems presents significant challenges, particularly for traditional measures of association [18,22,27]. Traditional linear or pairwise association measures, such as Pearson correlation or simple mutual information, often prove insufficient because they are fundamentally limited in capturing the inherent characteristics of complex systems [6]. Specifically, the widespread presence of nonlinear dependencies means that linear measures can fail to detect or accurately quantify the strength of relationships [6,7,13]. Furthermore, focusing only on pairwise relationships ignores the higher-order interactions and collective behaviors that give rise to emergent properties, where the combined effect of multiple components is crucial [1,13]. The multiscale nature and interdependence of elements also pose difficulties for methods that operate at a single scale or assume independence or simple pairwise connections [6,13]. Additionally, distinguishing true causal influences from mere associations is particularly challenging in complex systems due to factors like stochastic interactions, self-causation, and the pervasive influence of mediators, confounders, and colliders, which traditional association measures do not inherently address [7]. The dynamic nature, involving evolution, growth, stabilization, or collapse [1], and the presence of cross-level causal relationships further complicate the analysis [1], highlighting the necessity for advanced measures capable of capturing these complexities.​  

# 6.2 Causal Discovery Methods (Graphical Models)  

Learning causal graphs from observational data constitutes a fundamental task in causal inference. A primary class of approaches in this domain relies on graphical models, which include constraint-based methods, score-based methods, and functional causal models (FCMs) [6].  

Constraint-based methods infer causal structure by leveraging conditional independence relationships observed in the data [6]. These methods typically involve performing a series of conditional independence tests to determine the dependencies among variables and then constructing a graph that is consistent with these test results [6]. Prominent examples include the PC algorithm and the Fast Causal Inference (FCI) algorithm [6]. The PC algorithm operates under the assumption of no latent confounders, starting with a complete undirected graph and progressively removing edges based on conditional independence test failures [6]. It subsequently orients edges to identify v-structures and propagates orientations based on a set of rules [6]. The FCI algorithm generalizes the PC algorithm by allowing for the presence of unknown confounding variables, representing uncertainty about edge orientation and the potential existence of confounders using "o" marks on edges [6].​  

In contrast, score-based methods approach causal discovery as an optimization problem, searching over different graph structures to find the one that best fits the data according to a predefined score function [6]. A widely used score function is the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) [6]. Algorithms like Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) exemplify this approach; GES typically starts with an empty graph and iteratively adds or removes edges to optimize the score function, aiming to identify the graph structure within an equivalence class that yields the highest score [6]. While score-based methods can be more robust to errors in individual independence tests compared to constraint-based methods, they often face significant computational challenges due to the vast search space of possible graph structures.​  

Functional Causal Models (FCMs) offer an alternative perspective, representing each effect variable as a function of its direct causes plus an independent noise term [6]. Specifically, for a variable $Y$ and its direct cause(s) $X$ , the relationship is modeled as​  

$$
\begin{array} { r } { Y = f ( X ) + N , } \end{array}
$$  

where $N$ is the noise term independent of $X$ [6]. The key insight is that in many causal relationships, the noise and the cause are independent only in the causal direction ( $X \to Y$ ) and not in the reverse direction ( $Y  X$ ), especially when the functional relationship $f$ is non-linear [6]. This independence property allows FCMs to distinguish causal directions and discover causal relationships even in the presence of non-linear dependencies, an advantage particularly useful when traditional methods struggle [6]. These graphical model-based causal discovery methods find applications in various fields, such as genomics and ecology [6]. However, applying causal discovery methods to complex systems introduces additional challenges, including the potential existence of cyclic causal structures and cross-level causal relationships, which require specialized techniques [1].  

# 6.3 Causal Emergence  

The study of complex systems often reveals phenomena at macroscopic scales that are qualitatively distinct from the behaviors of their microscopic constituents [13]. This concept, known as emergence, posits that an effective theory describing system dynamics at a higher level of organization differs fundamentally from theories applicable at lower levels, representing a triumph over strict reductionism in understanding complex phenomena [13]. Within this framework, a critical aspect is the emergence of causal relationships at macro-levels from underlying micro-level interactions [1]. Understanding how complex causality arises from the interplay of multiple system components is a key challenge, and frameworks like the decomposition of causality can offer insights into this process [7].  

Quantifying causal emergence requires formal theories and measures capable of comparing causal structures across different scales of description. Two prominent quantitative approaches have been proposed to address this challenge [1].  

Erik Hoel's Causal Emergence Theory quantifies the degree of causal influence within a system, typically modeled as a Markov chain, by utilizing the concept of Effective Information (EI) [1]. This theory assesses causal emergence by comparing EI values computed at different macro and micro scales of the system, suggesting emergence occurs if macro-scale causality, as measured by EI, is stronger than micro-scale causality [1].​  

In contrast, Fernando E. Rosas' Partial Information Decomposition (PID) Emergence Theory offers an alternative definition that does not necessitate coarse-graining or explicit scale comparisons in the same manner as Hoel's approach [1]. Rosas' theory employs Partial Information Decomposition to measure the synergistic information shared between source variables and target variables [1]. This synergistic information is considered a key indicator of emergent causality, reflecting interactions between microscopic components that collectively influence macroscopic outcomes in a way that is not reducible to their individual effects [1]. While Hoel's theory relies on comparing a single measure (EI) across different predefined scales or coarse-grainings, Rosas' theory leverages the rich structure provided by PID to identify synergistic contributions to information transfer, offering a potentially distinct perspective on what constitutes causal emergence.  

The identification and quantification of causal emergence in real-world complex systems present significant computational challenges. Consequently, there is potential for leveraging machine learning techniques to automate the process of identifying emergent causal structures, although the specifics of such applications require further exploration [1].  

# 6.4 Synergistic, Unique, and Redundant Decomposition of Causality (SURD)  

Understanding complex causal relationships often necessitates moving beyond simple pairwise associations to capture the diverse ways in which multiple variables interact to influence an outcome. The Synergistic, Unique, and Redundant Decomposition of Causality (SURD) framework emerges as a novel approach designed precisely for this purpose, offering a richer understanding by decomposing shared information into distinct components [7]. Unlike traditional pairwise measures, which quantify the overall relationship between two variables without distinguishing the nature of their contribution when multiple predictors are involved, SURD provides a fine-grained analysis of multivariate dependencies.  

SURD dissects the information flow from a set of source variables to a target variable into four components [7]:  

\begin{itemize}  

\item \textbf{Redundant Causality} $( \Delta I _ { i  j } ^ { R } )$ : This component quantifies the shared causality among all elements within a variable subset, occurring when multiple variables contain the same information about the target variable.  

\item \textbf{Unique Causality} $( \Delta I _ { i  j } ^ { U } )$ ): This represents the causal contribution from a specific variable that cannot be gleaned from any other individual variable. It captures unique information about specific outcomes of the target variable.  

\item \textbf{Synergistic Causality} ( $\cdot \Delta I _ { i  j } ^ { S }$ ): This component measures the causality that arises from the joint effect of variables. More information about the target variable is gained by observing a collection of variables simultaneously than by summing the information from observing them individually.  

\item \textbf{Causality Leak} ( $\Delta I _ { \mathrm { l e a k }  j }$ ): This term accounts for the influence of unobserved variables on the target variable.  

\end{itemize}  

A key property of the SURD framework is that it prevents the duplication of causality measures. Furthermore, the framework satisfies an important information-theoretic relationship: the sum of the redundant, unique, and synergistic causalities from the observed source variables collectively equals the mutual information between the target variable and the observed variables [7].  

This decomposition offers a substantially richer understanding than simple pairwise measures because it explicitly differentiates how information from multiple sources combines. Pairwise measures, such as mutual information or transfer entropy computed between single source–target pairs, cannot discern whether the information shared between variable A and target Y is unique to A, also present in variable B (redundant), or only emerges when A and B are considered together (synergistic). SURD provides this capability, illuminating the complex interplay between predictors.  

SURD is designed to address challenges in causal inference, including the presence of confounding. The inclusion of the “Causality Leak” component ( $\Delta I _ { \mathrm { l e a k }  j }$ ) directly addresses the influence of unobserved variables on the target, which is a common source of confounding [7]. By explicitly quantifying this leak, the framework can provide insights into the degree to which unmeasured factors might be influencing the observed relationships. While the provided digest does not explicitly  

detail how SURD handles mediation, the decomposition into unique and synergistic components inherently relates to understanding how multiple upstream variables (potential mediators or direct causes) jointly influence a downstream variable.  

Benchmarking experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of SURD in practical applications [7]. These experiments reportedly demonstrate its efficacy compared to alternative causal inference methods [7]. However, the specific details of these experiments, including the datasets used and the alternative methods benchmarked against, are not provided in the digest, precluding a detailed analysis of the results here.  

The approach of decomposing information flow into distinct components like synergy is related to other frameworks in the field. For instance, Rosas' Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework is also mentioned in related literature as decomposing mutual information from multiple sources to a target to characterize phenomena like causal emergence [1]. Rosas' work, similarly to SURD's synergistic component, utilizes synergistic information values to quantitatively assess causal emergence based on system characteristics [1]. These shared themes underscore the growing recognition within the field that understanding multivariate causality requires moving beyond aggregate measures to dissect the specific roles of redundant, unique, and synergistic information contributions.​  

# 6.5 Measures in Network Analysis  

Network analysis provides a structural framework for understanding relationships within complex systems [13]. It involves representing entities as nodes and their interactions as edges, allowing for the quantification and characterization of relational patterns. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a prominent application area, focusing on the structure and dynamics of social relationships [22]. Networks can be categorized based on various structural properties, such as edge types (directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted), the nature of the nodes (e.g., organizations, publications, individuals), and the scale of analysis (individual node characteristics or overall network structure) [22].​  

Fundamental metrics are employed to characterize both individual nodes and the global network architecture [22]. Key measures for the overall network structure include connectivity (determining if a network is connected, strongly or weakly connected), density (the proportion of existing edges relative to the maximum possible), diameter (the longest shortest path between any two nodes), and average path length (the average of the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes) [22]. The clustering coefficient quantifies the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together [22].  

At the individual node level, measures often relate to centrality, indicating a node's importance or influence within the network [22]. Degree distribution describes the number of connections a node has; in directed networks, this differentiates between in-degree (incoming connections) and out-degree (outgoing connections) [22]. Degree centrality measures the number of direct neighbors. Betweenness centrality quantifies the extent to which a node lies on the shortest paths between other pairs of nodes. Closeness centrality measures how close a node is to all other nodes in the network, typically calculated as the inverse of the sum of the shortest path distances to all other nodes [22].​  

Complex networks, prevalent in many real-world systems, often exhibit specific properties such as the small-world phenomenon (short average path lengths and high clustering) and scale-free degree distributions (a few highly connected hubs and many nodes with few connections) [13]. While fundamental measures provide essential insights into network structure and node importance, the application of network analysis extends to diverse domains, including Internet mapping, security, and management, highlighting its utility in analyzing large-scale, complex systems [27].  

# 6.6 Applications (Internet Measurement, Agriculture 4.0 Intrusion Detection)  

Measures of association and network analysis techniques are instrumental in deciphering the structure and dynamics of complex real‐world systems, providing crucial insights across diverse domains. A primary area of application is Internet measurement and analysis [27]. Here, these techniques are employed in key areas including Internet mapping, network security, and network management [27]. By analyzing intricate association patterns present in network traffic flows or topological configurations, researchers can gain a profound understanding of how the Internet functions, identify potential vulnerabilities, and optimize performance. For example, analyzing traffic patterns can reveal associations indicative of Denial-of-Service attacks, while examining connectivity patterns helps in mapping the underlying network infrastructure— both critical aspects of network security and management [27].​  

Beyond large-scale infrastructure like the Internet, these analytical approaches are also vital in more specialized yet equally complex domains, such as securing the networks within Agriculture 4.0 [18]. Agriculture 4.0, characterized by its reliance on emerging technologies like cloud computing, fog/edge computing, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, constitutes a complex system domain [18]. Protecting this sector against escalating cyber threats necessitates sophisticated intrusion detection systems (IDS) [18]. Machine learning–based IDSs are particularly relevant in this context, leveraging the ability to identify subtle or complex patterns and associations in network data that may signify malicious activity [18]. The application of association measures in this setting involves identifying anomalous correlations or dependencies between different data points, device behaviors, or network events across the heterogeneous infrastructure. This approach faces context-specific challenges stemming from the unique characteristics of agricultural networks, such as the potentially resource-constrained nature of IoT devices, the diverse data types generated, and the need for real-time processing at the network edge. Thus, measures of association provide a foundational analytical tool for understanding complex system behaviors and detecting anomalies across varied domains, from global networks to specialized industrial systems.  

# 7. Measures for Specific Data Challenges  

Traditional measures of association often rely on assumptions regarding data properties, such as independence of observations. However, many real-world datasets exhibit complex structures or characteristics that violate these assumptions, necessitating the development or adaptation of specialized approaches. This section surveys recent developments in measures and techniques tailored to address the unique challenges posed by specific data types, including pedigree data, high-dimensional data, and categorical data.​  

For pedigree data, the inherent hierarchical structure of related individuals introduces dependencies that standard methods fail to account for. Challenges include effectively managing these relationships and addressing data quality issues like duplicate records. Algorithms such as SNIP (Sorted NeIghborhood for Pedigrees) leverage this hierarchical structure to enhance efficiency and accuracy in tasks like identifying potential data inconsistencies, thereby improving the reliability of subsequent analyses [12].​  

High-dimensional data presents formidable challenges, commonly referred to as the "curse of dimensionality." These include increased computational complexity, the risk of spurious correlations, and difficulties in estimation and interpretation [13]. Research has focused on developing methods to mitigate these issues, such as techniques for improving the estimation of information-theoretic measures through iterative Gaussianization [23], optimizing permutation testing for robust inference [9], and employing sparsity-aware models like sTPLS for omics data integration [21]. Furthermore, studies reveal complex phenomena unique to high-dimensional models, such as the multi-descent behavior observed in the generalization risk of minimum $\ell _ { 1 }$ ​ -norm interpolators in sparse regression, highlighting distinct theoretical properties compared to $\ell _ { 2 }$ -norm approaches [12,24].  

Categorical data poses challenges related to the interpretation of standard measures and issues stemming from data sparsity. Critically, the quality of association measurement in categorical data is significantly influenced by the data collection instrument itself. For instance, in multiple-choice questions, the design elements, including the number of distractors and the inclusion of special options like "All of the above" (AOTA) or "None of the above" (NOTA), can systematically impact response probabilities [12]. These design-induced variations can introduce biases, meaning observed associations may partly reflect artifacts of the question structure rather than purely the underlying relationships between variables. Addressing these challenges requires careful consideration of both statistical methods and the characteristics of the data generation process [12].  

Collectively, the research in these areas underscores the necessity of context-specific approaches to association analysis, acknowledging that data structure and collection methodology are integral to deriving valid and reliable insights.  

# 7.1 Pedigree Data  

Pedigree data, characterized by the inherent structure of related individuals, presents unique challenges for standard data processing and association analysis. The dependencies between family members violate the assumption of independence that underpins many statistical methods, necessitating specialized approaches. In large datasets, efficiently processing such data requires algorithms that can navigate and leverage complex familial relationships to ensure data quality and consistency. Consequently, dedicated algorithms are essential to handle the complexities of this hierarchical structure.  

One such unsupervised algorithm specifically designed for pedigree data is SNIP (Sorted NeIghborhood for Pedigrees) [12]. SNIP builds upon the established sorted neighborhood method, adapting it to efficiently identify and classify pairwise comparisons by leveraging the hierarchical nature of pedigrees [12]. By incorporating known familial relationships, SNIP can detect potential data issues or redundancies that standard methods might overlook. This focused approach enables improvements in data quality—for instance, through deduplication or by identifying inconsistencies in a way that respects the familial context—which in turn enhances the reliability of subsequent genetic analyses and association studies [12]. The SNIP algorithm is also available as an R package, snipR [12].  

# 7.2 High-Dimensional Data  

The application of association measures in high-dimensional settings presents significant challenges, including increased computational complexity and an elevated risk of identifying spurious correlations [13]. Dealing with massive, highdimensional datasets, often termed Big Data, is a fundamental challenge in complex systems research, necessitating approaches that integrate theoretical understanding with empirical data analysis [13]. A critical aspect of this challenge is the transition from raw data to meaningful information and ultimately to actionable knowledge, which requires identifying underlying mechanisms and cause-effect relationships rather than relying solely on statistical correlations [13].  

Addressing the curse of dimensionality is paramount. One proposed method mitigates this challenge through iterative Gaussianization, aiming to improve the estimation of information-theoretic measures in high dimensions [23]. Another technique focuses on optimizing permutation testing, a crucial step for statistical inference in high-dimensional contexts, particularly relevant for analyzing genomic datasets [9]. This optimized approach enhances computational speed and maintains insensitivity to the number of samples, increasing its applicability to large genomic studies [9]. Similarly, methods have been developed specifically for high-dimensional omics data. For instance, sTPLS employs sparsity constraints and weighting mechanisms to effectively filter redundant signals, thereby improving model interpretability in high-dimensional scenarios [21]. Practical applications in genomics, such as the analysis of high-quality SNPs in maize, demonstrate the use of multiple MGWAS methods specifically adapted to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional genetic data [20].  

Beyond methodological advancements, research has also revealed unique phenomena characteristic of high-dimensional models. For example, studies investigating minimum $\ell _ { 1 }$ ​ -norm interpolators in noisy sparse regression models under Gaussian design have uncovered a multi-descent phenomenon [24]. This behavior indicates that the generalization risk of the minimum $\ell _ { 1 }$ ​ -norm interpolator exhibits multiple phases of decrease and increase as model capacity increases [24]. This complex risk behavior is characterized by a system of two non-linear equations, highlighting a fundamental geometric distinction from the well-studied minimum $\ell _ { 2 }$ ​ -norm interpolator [24]. Understanding such phenomena is crucial for developing theoretical guarantees and practical guidance for model selection and generalization in high-dimensional spaces. The success of modern AI and Machine Learning techniques in handling such data underscores the potential of advanced computational methods [13].  

# 7.3 Categorical Data  

Measuring associations within categorical data presents distinct challenges, such as the interpretation of measures like odds ratios or handling issues related to data sparsity. Beyond the statistical methods themselves, the quality and structure of the data collection instrument significantly influence the observed associations. This is particularly evident in the design of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), commonly used to collect categorical responses. The specific configuration of an MCQ, including the number of distractors and the type of special options included, can systematically affect response patterns [12].​  

Research indicates that the probability of a respondent answering a multiple-choice question correctly is influenced by these design choices. For instance, the presence and nature of options such as "All of the above" (AOTA) and "None of the above" (NOTA) play a role. The probability of a correct answer can be notably high when an AOTA option is included and serves effectively as the correct response, or conversely, when neither NOTA nor AOTA options are employed [12]. Furthermore, the complexity introduced by multiple incorrect options affects performance; the probability of answering correctly has been shown to decrease as the number of distractors increases [12].  

These variations in response probabilities, driven by question design rather than solely by the underlying construct being measured, can introduce systematic biases into categorical data. Consequently, any associations subsequently measured using this data may reflect these design artifacts alongside or instead of genuine relationships between variables. Analyzing associations in categorical data collected via methods like MCQs therefore necessitates careful consideration of the data collection instrument's characteristics and their potential impact on response validity.

This section surveys a collection of recent methodological advancements and approaches specifically designed to address complex problems involving the assessment, prediction, or inference of relationships and structures within data. It encompasses diverse areas ranging from novel statistical inference techniques to applications of machine learning and reinforcement learning in understanding data dynamics and decision-making processes.​  

One key development lies in the realm of hybrid statistical methods, which integrate elements from different paradigms to leverage their respective strengths. An example discussed is a Frequentist-Bayes hybrid approach for covariance estimation, particularly relevant in complex scenarios like estimating covariances of unfolded distributions where explicit likelihood functions may be challenging to define [24].  

Machine learning techniques form a significant part of recent advancements, widely applied to general prediction tasks where the underlying relationships between features and outcomes are implicitly learned by the model. This includes methods like Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), valued for its ability to model non-linear relationships and quantify uncertainty [10,24]. A variety of other models, such as deep learning architectures (e.g., CNNs, DBNs, GNNs) [3,18], kernel methods (e.g., GBLUP, RKHS) [20], and specialized algorithms for integrating complex data (e.g., sTPLS, ${ \mathsf { N l S } } ^ { + }$ ) [1,21], are employed across various domains. Related work explores causal discovery from continuous variables using Functional Causal Models (FCMs) like LiNGAM and PNL [6]. Acknowledging the predictive power, research also highlights the ongoing challenge of interpreting these often "black-box" models to understand the discovered relationships [13].  

In the domain of research synthesis, advancements address challenges in meta-analysis, particularly concerning the integration of studies reporting disparate statistics. This involves developing methods to transform varied reported metrics, such as medians and quartiles, into consistent estimates like means and standard deviations, crucial for pooling results and utilizing effect sizes derived from correlation coefficients or related measures like the coefficient of nondetermination [17,26].​  

Another critical area is the quantification of uncertainty in estimates derived from dimensionality reduction techniques. For methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), assessing the reliability of estimated components, specifically the eigenvectors, from finite data samples is essential. Recent work focuses on methods for estimating eigenvector errors, including the application of bootstrap approaches to characterize sampling variability [19].​  

Furthermore, this section delves into advanced topics within reinforcement learning and bandit problems, which involve sequential decision-making and learning from interactions. This includes the introduction of the inverse bandit problem, a framework for estimating reward functions by observing the behavior of agents exhibiting low regret [19]. Additionally, dynamic planning and learning strategies are explored for problems where action rewards recover over time, discussing optimal policies for offline settings and online learning algorithms for unknown dynamics [19].​  

Collectively, the methodologies discussed in this section represent recent efforts to push the boundaries of quantitative analysis, offering sophisticated tools to tackle complex data structures, integrate diverse information, quantify uncertainty, and infer underlying relationships or motivations in dynamic environments. These advancements are crucial for enhancing the accuracy, interpretability, and robustness of analyses across scientific and engineering disciplines.  

# 8.1 Hybrid Approaches (Covariance Estimation)  

Combining elements from both Frequentist and Bayesian statistical paradigms can yield hybrid methods that leverage the strengths of each approach to potentially improve estimator performance in various contexts. One such hybrid approach has been proposed for the specific problem of estimating covariances of unfolded distributions, particularly in situations where defining a clear likelihood function is challenging [24].​  

This Frequentist–Bayes hybrid method for covariance estimation relies on the use of pseudo‐experiments [24]. A key advantage highlighted is that this method obviates the need for an explicitly defined likelihood function, which can be particularly beneficial in complex statistical models or experimental setups where constructing an accurate and tractable likelihood is difficult [24]. Furthermore, the method is noted to be compatible with any unfolding algorithm that utilizes a response matrix to model the detector or measurement system response [24].  

The application in estimating covariances of unfolded distributions through pseudo‐experiments illustrates a context where integrating principles from both statistical frameworks offers a pragmatic solution, especially when faced with limitations in model specification like the absence of a clear likelihood. While the specific advantages demonstrated pertain to flexibility and applicability in challenging scenarios, a comprehensive analysis of general benefits and trade‐offs across all applications of such hybrid methods would necessitate further investigation beyond this specific example.​  

# 8.2 Machine Learning Techniques for General Association/Prediction  

Machine learning techniques are increasingly employed for prediction tasks, where models implicitly learn the complex associations between input features and output variables. This approach moves beyond explicit statistical tests of association to build predictive models capable of capturing intricate patterns in data. A notable method in this domain is Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). GPR is particularly valuable due to its ability to model non‐linear relationships and provide a quantitative measure of uncertainty alongside predictions [10]. This makes it suitable for tasks such as predicting property price indices, where complex, non‐linear factors influence outcomes and quantifying the confidence in predictions is crucial [10]. GPR has also found applications in predicting properties of materials, such as liquid fuels [24]. The performance of GPR can be compared against other machine learning and econometric models to evaluate its efficacy in specific prediction contexts [10].  

Beyond GPR, a diverse array of machine learning models is utilized to capture complex patterns and make predictions across various fields. Deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), are prevalent, particularly in domains requiring the processing of complex data structures like those found in cybersecurity intrusion detection systems [18]. In genomics and multi‐omics data analysis, deep learning approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are applied to integrate diverse data types and predict functional variants [3]. Specific  

frameworks, such as the Neural Information Squeezer (NIS) and its improved version ${ \mathsf { N l S } } +$ , have been developed using neural network architectures to tackle challenges in identifying causal emergence by maximizing effective information. ${ \mathsf { N l S } } +$ demonstrates the capacity to automatically discover emergent macro variables and macro dynamics, showcasing superior generalization abilities in complex systems [1].​  

Other kernel‐based methods, conceptually related to models like Support Vector Machines and GPR, are also important for prediction and capturing complex interactions. For instance, in genomic selection (GS), kernel methods such as GBLUP and RKHS are employed for predicting the General Combining Ability (GCA) of agricultural traits, including kernel row number, kernel length, and kernel width [20]. Furthermore, specialized algorithms like sTPLS have been developed for integrating and analyzing high‐dimensional, weak signal, and strongly heterogeneous multi‐omics data, offering advantages in identifying complex biological associations such as gene–drug co‐modules, regulatory networks, and signaling pathways [21].  

The landscape also includes hybrid machine learning systems, such as PSO-PNN, voting-based extreme learning machines, and approaches incorporating game theory, particularly relevant in complex adversarial environments like cybersecurity intrusion detection [18]. Generative models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), are also used to simulate data, addressing limitations such as small sample sizes that can hinder the statistical power of predictive models in fields like genomics [3].  

While these machine learning techniques excel at capturing complex patterns and making accurate predictions by implicitly learning associations, a significant challenge lies in understanding howand whythese often “black-box” models achieve success, especially in complex systems [13]. Research continues to explore what can be learned from the internal mechanisms of these models regarding the interactions within the systems they study [13].​  

# 8.3 Meta-Analysis and Correlation Coefficients  

Correlation coefficients play a significant role in synthesizing research findings through meta-analysis, serving as effect size measures that quantify the strength and direction of association between variables across multiple studies. Related concepts, such as the coefficient of nondetermination, have also been noted for their applicability within the context of Meta-Analysis and Correlation Coefficients [26].​  

A key challenge in meta-analysis is the integration of studies that report disparate statistics, making it necessary to convert these varying metrics into a common effect size measure suitable for pooling. Recent advancements in statistical methods for meta-analysis address the challenge of pooling results from primary studies that report different types of statistics—such as median and quartiles rather than means and standard deviations [17]. These methods aim to transform diverse reported statistics into consistent estimates of the sample mean and standard deviation, which are fundamental for many metaanalytic procedures [17].​  

Specifically, techniques have been developed for the optimal estimation of the sample mean and standard deviation from these disparate reports [17]. These advancements involve incorporating sample size data with smoothly changing weights in the estimation process to achieve optimal accuracy [17]. Such developments in optimally estimating core statistics like the mean and standard deviation from varied reporting formats contribute to improving the overall accuracy and reliability of synthesized effect sizes within the meta-analytic framework [17].​  

# 8.4 Uncertainty Quantification in PCA  

Quantifying the reliability of components estimated through methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from empirical data presents a significant challenge in data analysis. PCA identifies principal components—the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix—that represent directions of maximum variance. While these eigenvectors capture the underlying structure in the data, their estimates derived from a finite sample are subject to sampling variability. Ensuring the trustworthiness of these estimates, particularly the leading eigenvectors that often form the basis of dimensionality reduction or feature extraction, requires robust methods for uncertainty quantification [19].​  

Addressing this challenge involves developing techniques to estimate the error bounds or sampling variability associated with the estimated leading eigenvectors. This task is particularly crucial in modern data settings, such as those involving dynamic or streaming data, where data arrives sequentially and estimates may need to be updated or validated continuously. Traditional asymptotic theory provides tools for uncertainty quantification under certain assumptions, but adapting these tools for non-stationary or high-dimensional data streams can be complex. Non-parametric approaches, such as bootstrap methods, offer a flexible alternative to approximate the sampling distributions of the estimated eigenvectors. By resampling the data (or residuals, depending on the specific bootstrap variant) and recomputing the PCA components for each resampled dataset, a distribution of estimates can be generated, from which confidence intervals or other measures of variability can be derived [19].​  

# 8.5 Advanced Techniques in Reward Estimation (Inverse Bandit)  

A recent development in inferring user preferences or underlying motivations from observed behavior is the introduction of the "inverse bandit" problem [19]. This framework addresses the challenge of estimating the reward function of a multiarmed bandit instance by observing the learning process of a demonstrator who exhibits low regret [19]. Unlike traditional inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), which typically assumes the demonstrator follows an optimal policy and can suffer from identifiability issues, the inverse bandit approach leverages the demonstrator's behavior during the exploration phase to achieve consistent reward estimates [19].  

The technique estimates optimal rewards by analyzing the choices made by the demonstrator as they explore different options. Specifically, simple and efficient procedures for reward estimation have been developed for demonstrations generated by a class of upper-confidence-bound (UCB)-based algorithms [19]. An interesting theoretical finding within this framework is that reward estimation becomes less challenging as the algorithm's regret increases, suggesting a relationship between the degree of exploration (which contributes to higher regret in early stages) and the informativeness of the observed behavior for reward inference [19]. The optimal tradeoff between exploration by the demonstrator and the ease of reward estimation by the observer has been characterized through information-theoretic lower bounds that match derived upper bounds [19]. Empirical evaluations using synthetic datasets and simulations based on experimental design data from the natural sciences have provided support for the theoretical findings [19]. This method thus offers a novel perspective on inferring latent preferences by making use of the inherent exploration present even in seemingly rational, low-regret decision-making processes [19].  

# 8.6 Dynamic Planning and Learning under Recovering Rewards  

Sequential decision-making problems where the value or availability of an action or resource changes dynamically after utilization constitute a significant challenge in optimization and learning. A notable instance of this arises in scenarios where selecting an option diminishes its immediate reward, which subsequently recovers over time if the option remains unutilized. Such dynamics are captured in a class of multi-armed bandit problems featuring $\big \backslash \big ( \mathsf { N } \big \backslash \big )$ distinct arms, where a decision-maker is constrained to pulling at most \( K \) arms in each time period over a horizon of $\backslash ( \intercal \backslash )$ periods [19].  

In this model, the expected reward of an arm experiences an immediate drop upon being pulled, followed by a nonparametric recovery as its idle time increases [19]. The overarching objective in such settings is to maximize the expected cumulative rewards accumulated over the \( T \) time periods [19].  

For the offline version of this problem, where the model parameters governing the reward recovery process are known, strategies for optimal planning aim to exploit this known structure. One approach investigated involves the development of “Purely Periodic Policies” [19]. These policies are constructed to leverage the predictable recovery dynamics to determine which arms to pull and when. For the offline problem, a proposed Purely Periodic Policy has been shown to achieve an approximation ratio of  

for maximizing cumulative rewards [19]. This performance guarantee demonstrates that the policy is asymptotically optimal as the number of allowed pulls per period, $\mathsf { \backslash } ( \mathsf { K } \backslash )$ , tends towards infinity [19].  

When the parameters governing the reward recovery are unknown, the problem shifts to an online learning setting. In such cases, the decision-maker must simultaneously explore the reward dynamics to estimate parameters while exploiting current knowledge to maximize rewards, a classic exploration–exploitation trade-off. Online learning approaches, such as those based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle, are employed to address this challenge [19]. A UCB-based policy has been designed for the online version of this problem, which balances exploration of arms with uncertain recovery dynamics and exploitation of arms with estimated high potential rewards [19].  

The theoretical performance of this online policy is analyzed in terms of regret, defined as the difference between the expected cumulative reward of an optimal offline policy and the cumulative reward achieved by the online policy. The UCBbased policy approximately achieves a regret bound of  

against the offline benchmark, where $\big \backslash \big ( \mathsf { N } \big \backslash \big )$ is the number of arms and $\backslash ( \textsf { T } \backslash )$ is the time horizon [19]. This bound characterizes how the performance of the online learning strategy scales with the problem dimensions and horizon.

These tools are frequently utilized across diverse analyses, including data preprocessing, computation, and result display, as seen in applications like time series analysis [2]. Python also underpins specialized tools, such as Gencube, designed for centralized retrieval and integration of multi-omics resources, offering ease of installation and compatibility across common operating systems like Linux and MacOS [21]. MATLAB is also utilized in certain analytical contexts, such as for performance evaluation in cybersecurity systems [18].​  

Beyond these general environments, numerous domain-specific software packages and pipelines are indispensable for specialized types of data and analyses. In omics research, where the importance of bioinformatics tools is implicitly acknowledged [31], a suite of specialized software is required. For instance, genomic studies like whole-genome association analysis utilize a pipeline of tools for distinct stages: BWA for read alignment, GATK for variant calling, Structure and CLUMPP for analyzing population structure, TASSEL for calculating kinship matrices, GAPIT and mrMLM for performing genome-wide association tests with different methods, SnpEff for predicting candidate genes, and BGLR for genomic prediction [20]. Algorithms like sTPLS are also implemented within these computational frameworks for tasks such as multiomics data analysis [21]. The selection of software often depends on the specific task requirements, the scale and type of data, and the methodological approach employed.​  

The availability of code repositories, such as those providing implementations for specific computational methods like optimized permutation testing for information theory-based measures [9], further facilitates research reproducibility and the dissemination of novel tools. However, the effective utilization of this diverse landscape of software and tools necessitates adequate training. Academic programs increasingly incorporate dedicated courses on programming languages for statistics and statistical computing, covering tools like R and Python, to equip researchers with the necessary skills for data exploration and analysis [30]. Workshops and focused training resources play a vital role in bridging the gap between theoretical statistical knowledge and the practical application of computational tools in modern data analysis.

Despite significant advancements in the field of measures of association, researchers continue to face several substantial challenges, particularly when dealing with increasingly complex, high-dimensional, and diverse data types encountered in modern scientific inquiry [3,14]. A primary challenge lies in the computational cost associated with estimating association measures, especially information-theoretic measures and permutation testing methods, within high-dimensional spaces [9,14,23]. The analysis of ultra-large-scale datasets, such as petabyte-level whole-genome sequencing data, exacerbates this issue, demanding more efficient algorithms and scalable distributed computing frameworks [3].  

Data quality presents another critical obstacle. Inconsistent reporting formats across studies pose challenges in metaanalysis, requiring robust methods for transforming disparate statistical summaries into comparable metrics [17]. Furthermore, managing data quality issues and addressing security vulnerabilities are paramount in domains like intelligent agriculture systems, where data confidentiality, integrity, and availability are vital [18,21]. Evaluating the performance of anomaly detection models, for instance, is often hindered by the scarcity of labeled data, necessitating alternative evaluation strategies like cross-validation on available labeled data or unsupervised metrics [2].  

Ensuring the interpretability of results from increasingly complex models, often perceived as black boxes, remains a significant challenge [21]. Understanding the underlying causes and implications of detected patterns, such as anomalies in time series data, frequently requires incorporating domain knowledge, related datasets, historical context, and external information [25]. For causal discovery, challenges persist in applying methods to complex systems characterized by cyclic structures and cross-level relationships [1]. Existing causal methodologies may struggle with nonlinear dependencies, stochastic interactions, self-causation, and effects from unobserved variables, as well as the inability to classify causal interactions accurately into redundant, unique, and synergistic components [7]. Other specific challenges include overcoming the limited prediction accuracy in certain genomic analyses [20], accurately quantifying relationships in social networks to bridge macro and micro-level analyses [22], differentiating positive and negative cointegration in economic time series analysis [8], and addressing sensitivity to parameter choices in cluster comparison metrics [29].​  

Addressing these challenges opens several promising avenues for future research. One key direction involves developing novel measures and methods, potentially integrating insights and techniques from disparate fields such as statistics, machine learning, and information theory [1,13,14]. This includes exploring more efficient ways to capture asynchronous inter-variable dependencies in time series analysis [16], developing measures less sensitive to parameter choices [29], and enhancing methods for predicting outcomes in volatile domains like property markets by incorporating diverse indicators [10].​  

Improving computational efficiency and scalability is crucial. Future work could focus on optimizing estimation techniques for information-theoretic measures [14,23], incorporating adaptive schemes for permutation testing [9], and developing more robust and scalable methodologies for handling large datasets [14].​  

Integrating multi-dimensional data is a significant trend, particularly in biological sciences, involving multi-omics and single cell data analysis [3,21,31]. Utilizing resources such as large biobanks can enhance statistical power to discover subtle  

genetic associations [3]. Artificial intelligence, specifically approaches like graph neural networks, offers potential for integrating diverse data types and predicting functional elements [3].  

Advancements in causal inference represent a critical frontier. Future research aims to extend causal discovery methods to account for variable grouping and coarse-graining in complex systems, develop techniques for detecting emergent patterns and early warning signals [1], and analyze "causal chains" to identify intervention targets from the sequence of genetic variation to phenotypes [3]. Further work is needed to understand how emergent causality evolves in response to environmental adaptation [1].​  

Applying measures of association to novel or complex domains continues to yield new opportunities. This includes applying methodologies to socio-technical systems, complexity engineering, global change analysis, neuroscience, health sciences, and quantum complexity [13]. Specific applications involve cybersecurity intrusion detection in emerging fields like Agriculture 4.0 [18], applying time series tests to domains beyond economics like climate science [8], and using findings to guide clinical translation and therapeutic development [3]. There is also a need for continued application of methods like Social Network Analysis to various social phenomena [22] and addressing challenges in network measurement and analysis [27].​  

Finally, establishing robust ethical and data sharing frameworks is essential, particularly in AI and big data-driven health innovation [21]. Developing frameworks like federated learning can facilitate secure cross-database analysis while preserving data privacy [3]. Moreover, fostering better communication of complex systems approaches and promoting interdisciplinary learning are crucial for the field's broader impact [13].  

# 11. Conclusion  

Measures of association are fundamental tools indispensable for understanding the relationships between variables across a vast spectrum of scientific and social disciplines. They are used to quantify correlations in economic indicators and predict trends in real estate [8,10], to analyze social network structures [22], to interpret complex biological data in omics research [21,31], and to enhance cybersecurity in emerging domains such as Agriculture 4.0 [18]. Recent studies in sociology have further underscored the importance of robust statistical methods, illustrating a trend toward increasingly sophisticated models capable of handling complex data types [4].  

Recent developments have significantly advanced the field, particularly by addressing challenges posed by highdimensional data, intricate dependencies, and large computational scales. Information theory continues to provide a rigorous foundation for quantifying information and uncertainty, offering essential measures such as entropy and mutual information to understand variable associations [14]. Innovations include methods for estimating these measures via multidimensional Gaussianization—especially beneficial for high-dimensional datasets [23]—and optimized algorithms for permutation testing that dramatically reduce the computational cost for large-scale applications [9]. Moreover, informationtheoretic measures have proven effective in practical applications such as the comparison of different data clusterings [29].  

Machine learning techniques have emerged as powerful complements to traditional statistical measures. They offer robust approaches for pattern recognition, prediction, and anomaly detection in complex systems such as time series data [2,25]. Specific models, like optimized Gaussian Process Regression, have demonstrated superior performance in forecasting economic indices [10]. Novel deep learning architectures, such as FCDATA, explicitly address the challenges of capturing complex, asynchronous dependencies in time series, leading to improved results in anomaly detection [16]. These applications highlight the ability of machine learning to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in diverse data streams.  

Moving beyond mere correlation, the field has seen substantial growth in causal inference methods aimed at discerning directed relationships. Decades of research have yielded a variety of computational approaches for causal discovery— including constraint-based, score-based, and functional causal models—providing researchers with a diverse toolkit [6]. Novel frameworks are now being developed to offer a more nuanced understanding of causality in complex systems. For example, approaches like SURD allow for the decomposition of causality into synergistic, unique, and redundant components, providing a more reliable quantification than previous methods [7]. Additionally, concepts such as causal emergence are contributing to deeper insights into complex phenomena across biological and social systems [1].  

Despite these strides, limitations persist, necessitating further research. Challenges include improving estimation techniques for measures in contexts such as meta-analysis [17], addressing the power limitations of standard statistical tests in small samples [8], and carefully selecting, tuning, and evaluating models in complex time series analysis [2]. Developing methods that are simultaneously computationally efficient, statistically robust, and capable of capturing the diverse forms of association and causation in real-world data remains a critical focus.  

Looking ahead, the future of association measures is poised for further breakthroughs driven by the convergence of information theory, machine learning, and causal inference. The integration of these perspectives holds immense potential for tackling intractable problems, such as achieving intelligent analysis and integration of multi-omics data for precision medicine [21] or gaining a profound understanding of complex systems and their fundamental questions [1]. Fostering interdisciplinary collaboration will be essential for facilitating the transfer of concepts and methodologies across traditional boundaries, thereby driving innovation and addressing the complex challenges in global health, scientific discovery, and technological advancement [13,21].​  

Overall, continued research and collaboration are key to developing the next generation of measures capable of illuminating the intricate web of relationships that govern our increasingly complex world.
