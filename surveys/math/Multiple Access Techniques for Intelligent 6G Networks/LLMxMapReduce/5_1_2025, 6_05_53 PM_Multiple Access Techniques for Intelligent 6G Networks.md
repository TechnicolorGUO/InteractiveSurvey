# 1. Introduction  

The landscape of wireless communication is undergoing a profound transformation, evolving from the established fifthgeneration (5G) networks towards the envisioned sixth-generation (6G) [1,12,34,41]. This evolution is driven by the imperative to support a vastly increased scale of connected devices and enable novel, computationally intensive services that bridge the physical and digital realms [4,23,34,37]. Beyond merely enhancing data rates, latency, and capacity relative to 5G, 6G aims to deliver capabilities such as holographic communication, digital twins, extended reality (XR), ubiquitous connectivity, and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) [4,23,24,41]. These emerging applications necessitate performance metrics far exceeding current capabilities, including ultra-low latency, massive connection density (up to ${ 1 0 } ^ { 8 }$ devices $/ { \mathsf { k m } } ^ { 2 }$ ), and enhanced reliability [1,4].​

Traditional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques, which allocate distinct time, frequency, or code resources to different users, inherently limit the number of users that can simultaneously access the network and struggle to efficiently serve the sporadic traffic generated by massive numbers of devices [1,16,27]. Their design, largely optimized for humancentric communication, is not well-suited to the proliferation of machine-type communication (MTC) and uplink-dominated scenarios anticipated in 6G [15,16]. This limitation necessitates a paradigm shift towards non-orthogonal and more intelligent multiple access (MA) approaches that can efficiently manage interference, enhance spectral efficiency, and accommodate heterogeneous traffic profiles [1,12,19]. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), which allows multiple users to share the same resources, is widely recognized as a promising foundational technology for 6G to address these challenges, despite facing implementation complexities such as high receiver complexity [1,12,27,30].​  

The vision for 6G extends beyond mere performance enhancements to encompass the concept of "Intellicise" (intelligent and simplified) wireless networks [9,35]. This paradigm emphasizes the integration of intelligence, potentially leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), into network design and operation to achieve unprecedented levels of automation, adaptability, and efficiency [35,37]. Intelligent MA techniques are fundamentally aligned with this vision, employing AI and advanced signal processing to dynamically manage radio resources, mitigate interference, and optimize access based on diverse user requirements, channel conditions, and service characteristics [2,3,23,24,38].​  

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the critical multiple access techniques being explored and developed for intelligent 6G networks. We begin by detailing the stringent requirements and diverse scenarios driving the need for novel MA solutions in the 6G era. Subsequently, we delve into prominent categories of intelligent and non-orthogonal multiple access techniques, analyzing their fundamental principles, potential benefits, and associated technical challenges. Specific attention is given to techniques such as advanced NOMA schemes, grant-free access, and MA methods integrated with  

emerging 6G technologies like massive MIMO, cell-free networks, intelligent surfaces, and integrated sensing and communication. The survey concludes by discussing open research challenges and future directions in the field of intelligent multiple access for 6G networks, highlighting their pivotal role in realizing the full potential of this transformative technology.​  

# 2. 6G Vision, Requirements, and Key Scenarios  

The sixth generation (6G) of mobile communication is envisioned as a transformative leap beyond 5G, aiming to create a more comprehensive and immersive communication architecture that seamlessly integrates the physical, digital, and human worlds [9,34,37]. This future network is expected to support efficient wireless connections between individuals, machines, and objects, underpinning the Internet of Human-Machine-Things (IoHMT) and enabling unprecedented digital transformation across industries, economies, and societies [14,16,35]. Key advancements include expanding network functionalities beyond traditional communication to incorporate information, artificial intelligence (AI), compute, and sensing services [9,34]. New paradigms like intelligent environments facilitated by technologies such as intelligent reflecting surfaces (RIS), ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), cell-free architectures, and near-field communication are also anticipated to enable higher data rates, enhanced sensing capabilities, and improved coverage [11,21,42].

To guide the development of 6G, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has proposed six major application scenarios: immersive communication, ultra-massive connection, ultra-high reliability and low latency communication, ubiquitous connectivity, AI and communication convergence, and sensing and communication convergence [4,5,36]. Each of these scenarios imposes unique and demanding requirements on the underlying multiple access design.  

Immersive communication, an evolution of enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), focuses on delivering rich, interactive experiences such as holographic communication, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), extended reality (XR), the metaverse, and cloud gaming [2,7,9,36,41]. These applications demand significantly higher data rates, potentially reaching several hundred gigabits per second (Gbps) and aggregate capacities of 10 Tbit/s per square kilometer [7,34,35], alongside consistent service quality and precise time synchronization [36].  

Ultra-massive connection expands upon massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC), aiming to connect a significantly larger number of devices, ranging from millions to potentially tens or hundreds of millions per square kilometer, a 10 to 100- fold increase compared to 5G [4,5,35]. This scenario encompasses diverse applications like environmental IoT, digital twins, smart cities, and various industrial IoT deployments [3,4,5,7,15,18,25,38]. The demands here are centered on supporting high connection density, low power consumption, low-cost devices, sporadic activation characteristics, and efficient transmission of small data packets [3,5,25,36]. Novel multiple access techniques are crucial to handle the surge in devices and avoid network overload and signaling congestion [5].  

Ultra-high reliability and low latency communication (uRLLC), evolving into enhanced uRLLC (euRLLC) in 6G, supports critical applications such as autonomous mobility, robotics, automation, smart healthcare, and industrial manufacturing [2,9,14,24,34,41]. This scenario imposes extremely strict requirements on both reliability and latency [10,14,36]. Air interface latency is required to reach sub-millisecond levels, and end-to-end latency may also reach sub-milliseconds under specific conditions [4,34,35].​  

Ubiquitous connectivity aims to provide seamless and pervasive coverage, particularly in currently underserved areas like oceans, mountains, and remote regions [34,35]. This necessitates the integration of space-based networks (e.g., Low-Earth Orbit satellites) and ground-based infrastructure to form satellite-terrestrial integrated networks [2,8,18,20,21,36]. Such integration achieves wider coverage and potentially higher quality services by leveraging the complementary advantages of satellite and terrestrial components [20].​  

AI and communication convergence is a new scenario where AI is fundamentally integrated with communication systems [36]. This bidirectional integration means AI enhances network performance and efficiency through intelligent resource management and optimization, while the network provides the necessary infrastructure to support AI training and inference, including federated learning for distributed data processing [26,36,44].​  

Sensing and communication convergence (ISAC) is another novel scenario for 6G, enabling wireless networks to acquire sensing capabilities alongside communication functions [4,23,24,36]. ISAC allows for wide-area multi-dimensional sensing, acquiring motion and spatial information of objects, both connected and unconnected [36]. This convergence offers potential gains in spectrum and hardware efficiency [23], enabling high-precision sensing and positioning alongside high data rates [21,24]. Applications include smart homes, smart factories, Internet of Vehicles, remote robot control, and contactless health monitoring [23,24]. The combination of large-scale MIMO and ISAC is particularly promising due to the enhanced spatial resolution provided by large antenna arrays [23].​  

These diverse and demanding scenarios highlight inherent trade-offs between key performance indicators. For example, achieving ultra-high data rates typically requires high spectral efficiency and complex signaling, which can conflict with the low power consumption and simplified signaling needs of massive low-power IoT devices [5]. Similarly, the requirements for ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliability in URLLC scenarios can compete with the need for massive connection density, as supporting a vast number of devices with sporadic traffic can strain network resources and increase signaling overhead, impacting delay and potential packet loss [5]. Different scenarios inherently prioritize different metrics; immersive communication emphasizes data rate and latency, while ultra-massive connection prioritizes density and energy efficiency [4,5,25].​  

Furthermore, the integration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, while essential for achieving ubiquitous connectivity, introduces significant challenges for resource management and mobility [20]. Managing resources across heterogeneous network layers with varying characteristics, such as different propagation delays, Doppler shifts, and link reliabilities, requires flexible scheduling schemes [20]. Ensuring seamless service continuity and effective interference coordination across integrated space and ground segments also poses complex problems for multiple access design in this hybrid environment [20].​  

The necessity to simultaneously support such a wide spectrum of challenging and often conflicting requirements, coupled with the complexity of integrated network architectures, underscores the critical need for flexible, adaptive, and intelligent multiple access solutions in 6G networks [1,5,12,15,27]. Future multiple access techniques must be capable of dynamically adapting resource allocation, managing diverse traffic patterns, mitigating interference, and supporting various service types and devices efficiently across complex, multi-layered network structures.  

# 3. Fundamentals and Categories of Multiple Access  

Multiple access techniques are fundamental to wireless communication systems, enabling multiple users to share limited channel resources efficiently [33]. The evolution of these techniques has largely dictated the capacity and capabilities of cellular networks across generations.  

Historically, multiple access schemes primarily relied on orthogonal resource allocation to avoid interference between users. In the first generation (1G) of mobile communication networks, Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) was employed, where different users were allocated distinct frequency bands for transmission [1,33]. This was followed by Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) in 2G systems, which allocated different time slots within the same frequency channel to various users [1,33]. The third generation (3G) introduced Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), allowing users to share the same time and frequency resources simultaneously but utilizing distinct spreading codes for separation [1,33]. The advent of 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) saw the widespread adoption of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), which partitions the available frequency spectrum into multiple narrow orthogonal subcarriers, allocating different subcarriers or groups of subcarriers to different users [1,33,43]. These methods, collectively known as Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA), ensure minimal interference by allocating resources orthogonally in the time, frequency, or code domains [1,27,28,33]. However, a primary limitation of OMA techniques is that the number of users that can be simultaneously supported is fundamentally limited by the number of available orthogonal resource blocks [1,27], presenting challenges in supporting the massive connectivity and diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements envisioned for future networks like 6G [3,33].​  

To address the limitations of OMA, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has emerged as a promising technique. In contrast to OMA, NOMA allows multiple users to share the same time, frequency, or code resources simultaneously [12,19,28,39]. The core principle of NOMA is spectrum sharing, where multiple users are served within the same resource block [12]. This is primarily enabled by techniques such as superposition coding at the transmitter, where signals for multiple users are combined, and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receiver to mitigate interference [3,19]. SIC allows users with better channel conditions (strong users) to decode and subtract the signals of users with poorer channel conditions (weak users) before decoding their own signals [19].​  

Comparing OMA and NOMA, NOMA offers advantages in terms of potentially higher spectral efficiency and increased user capacity, as it allows multiplexing users within the same resource block beyond the orthogonality constraint of OMA [1,3]. This makes NOMA particularly attractive for scenarios demanding massive connectivity, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) [3]. However, NOMA generally introduces higher receiver complexity due to the requirement for SIC, which needs to be carefully managed [27]. Fairness among users is another critical design consideration in NOMA, often managed through appropriate power allocation strategies in power-domain NOMA.​  

![](images/2c88666002b72c5465f93ce5ef7f2a871d73fc31f4cc07769aef16b131b30095.jpg)  

Multiple access techniques can be broadly categorized based on the domain(s) of resource sharing. This includes time domain (e.g., TDMA), frequency domain (e.g., FDMA, OFDMA), and code domain (e.g., CDMA) [1,33]. NOMA techniques, deviating from strict orthogonality, often utilize power domain multiplexing (Power-domain NOMA) or sophisticated codebook-based methods (Code-domain NOMA) to enable multiplexing in time-frequency resources [3,19]. Representative code-domain NOMA technologies include Low-Density Spreading (LDS), Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA), Pattern Division Multiple Access (PDMA), and Compression Sensing-based Multi-User Detection (CS-MUD) [3]. Emerging schemes like Resource Hopping Multiple Access (RHMA) utilize resource hopping patterns as signatures for massive user access [3].​  

Beyond scheduled access, random access schemes, such as Aloha and Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA), constitute another category, suitable for scenarios with sporadic data traffic, particularly under light network loads, allowing devices to transmit without explicit resource grants and managing collisions [33]. Grant-free access mechanisms, a form of random access, are highlighted for their reduced signaling overhead and efficiency in supporting massive, low-latency device connections crucial for scenarios like massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) in 6G [15,25,26]. Spectrum access can also be categorized by mechanisms like Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) or spectrum sharing, the latter allowing simultaneous use by different users leveraging techniques like power control [32]. Furthermore, spectrum management approaches, such as administrative allocation, market mechanisms, and unlicensed sharing, influence how spectrum resources are made available for multiple access [2]. These diverse categories and approaches form the foundation for understanding the multiple access landscape in the context of intelligent 6G networks.​  

# 4. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) Techniques  

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) stands as a pivotal technology for future wireless networks, particularly in the context of intelligent 6G systems, due to its potential to significantly enhance data rates, spectral efficiency, and user capacity [12,27,30,31,35,39]. Unlike conventional Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) schemes where users are allocated distinct time, frequency, or code resources, NOMA allows multiple users to share the same resources non-orthogonally [1,28,33]. The fundamental principles enabling this resource sharing are Superposition Coding (SC) at the transmitter and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receiver [1,28,33]. SC involves combining signals intended for different users before transmission, while SIC is employed at the receiver to iteratively decode and cancel interfering signals from other users sharing the same resource, thereby isolating the desired signal [1,28,33,39].  

NOMA techniques can be broadly categorized into Power-Domain NOMA (PD-NOMA) and Code-Domain NOMA (CD-NOMA) [1,33]. PD-NOMA distinguishes users' signals based on allocated power levels, utilizing SC at the transmitter and SIC at the receiver [1,28,33]. A key aspect of PD-NOMA is the power allocation strategy, which often assigns higher power to users with poorer channel conditions (weak users) and lower power to users with better channel conditions (strong users) [1,19,33]. This channel-aware approach aims to balance system throughput and user fairness [19]. The achievable data rates for users are intrinsically linked to their allocated power coefficients and channel gains, as illustrated by the rate expressions for a two-user scenario:​  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { \displaystyle R _ { m 1 } = \log _ { 2 } \Biggl ( 1 + \frac { \rho | h _ { m } | ^ { 2 } \alpha _ { m } ^ { 2 } } { \rho | h _ { m } | ^ { 2 } \alpha _ { n } ^ { 2 } + 1 } \Biggr ) } } \\ { { \displaystyle R _ { n 1 } = \log _ { 2 } \Biggl ( 1 + \rho | h _ { n } | ^ { 2 } \alpha _ { n } ^ { 2 } \Biggr ) } } \end{array}
$$  

where $\rho$ is the transmit SNR, $h _ { m }$ and $h _ { n }$ ​ are the channel gains, and $\alpha _ { m } ^ { 2 } , \alpha _ { n } ^ { 2 }$ are power allocation coefficients with $\alpha _ { m } ^ { 2 } > \alpha _ { n } ^ { 2 }$ if $| h _ { m } | ^ { 2 } < | h _ { n } | ^ { 2 }$ and $\alpha _ { m } ^ { 2 } + \alpha _ { n } ^ { 2 } = 1$ [33]. SIC is critical for decoding, with users performing cancellation based on their relative channel gains or assigned power levels [1]. The decision on the SIC decoding order can rely on Channel State Information (CSI), Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, or a combination thereof [1].  

In contrast, CD-NOMA employs user-specific, non-orthogonal spreading codes, often with sparse or low-correlation properties, to multiplex users within the same time and frequency resources [33]. Prominent examples include Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) and Multi-User Shared Access (MUSA). SCMA maps data directly to sparse multi-dimensional codewords, enabling overload capability and efficient Message Passing Algorithm (MPA) for decoding [33]. While requiring sophisticated multi-user detection (MUD), the sparse structure helps manage decoding complexity [33]. Both SCMA and MUSA achieve overload and rely on iterative receivers, differing in their code constructions and decoding graphs [33].  

Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is another significant technique, often seen as a generalization that unifies OMA and NOMA [1,19,39]. RSMA splits each user message into common and private parts, encoding common parts into a shared stream and private parts into individual streams [1,4,5]. Receivers decode the common stream first, using SIC to remove its interference, before decoding their private stream [1,4,5]. This partial interference decoding strategy offers flexible interference management, potentially yielding performance gains in spectral and energy efficiency, especially in interference-limited scenarios [4,5]. However, optimizing rate splitting, power allocation, and precoding in RSMA presents notable challenges [4,5,39].​  

Beyond these core variants, NOMA is being explored for integration with numerous emerging technologies critical for 6G, including Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems (MIMO-NOMA), millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications (mmWave-NOMA), and massive Internet of Things (IoT) deployments [1,12,17,18,33]. MIMO-NOMA introduces challenges in joint beamforming and SIC order optimization [1]. mmWave-NOMA focuses on joint beamforming, user pairing, and power allocation under directional transmission [17]. Grant-free NOMA approaches are being investigated for massive IoT to improve access efficiency and reduce overhead [15,18]. Other integrated scenarios include THz communications, BackCom, Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Cooperative communication, Multi-point Coordinated (CoMP) transmission, and Cognitive Radio (CR) [1,12,19,20,33].​  

Despite the significant performance gains promised by NOMA in terms of spectral efficiency and user capacity, its implementation faces inherent challenges and limitations [27]. A major concern is the complexity of SIC receivers, particularly as the number of users sharing resources increases [27]. The performance of NOMA, especially SIC, is also highly sensitive to channel estimation errors [39], as imperfect CSI can lead to inaccurate power allocation and incomplete interference cancellation. Furthermore, the non-orthogonal nature of NOMA inherently introduces security vulnerabilities, making systems susceptible to eavesdropping [39]. Physical layer security techniques, such as precoding optimization and strategic SIC ordering, along with the use of full-duplex relays transmitting artificial noise, are being researched to mitigate these risks [39]. The need for complex joint optimizations (e.g., power allocation, user pairing, beamforming, rate splitting) further adds to the implementation challenges, necessitating robust and efficient algorithms for practical deployment. Addressing these challenges is crucial for realizing NOMA's full potential in enabling the demanding requirements of intelligent 6G networks.​  

# 4.1 Power-Domain NOMA (PD-NOMA)  

Power-Domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (PD-NOMA) is a key multiple access technique that enables multiple users to share the same time–frequency resources simultaneously by distinguishing their signals in the power domain [1,33].  

![](images/9b2384eff763a0a9f0d911948dc5d64a72d019e1b171641c10b2ced074bae8f4.jpg)  

This non–orthogonality is achieved through Superposition Coding (SC) at the transmitter and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receiver [1,33]. The core principle of SC is to encode and superimpose the signals intended for different users with distinct power levels, allowing their separation based on these power differences [1,28]. In a two–user scenario, the transmitter encodes each user's information and combines them into a single signal sequence with allocated powers [1].​  

A fundamental aspect of PD-NOMA is the strategy for allocating power levels to users. Typically, power allocation is inversely related to channel gain, meaning users experiencing poorer channel conditions (often termed “weak” users) are allocated higher transmission power, while users with better channel conditions (“strong” users) receive lower power [1,19,33]. This channel–aware power assignment aims to balance the system throughput and user fairness by ensuring that users with unfavorable channels can still achieve a minimum level of performance while exploiting the good channels of others [19]. Beyond channel conditions, power levels can also be assigned based on users’ Quality of Service (QoS) requirements [1]. Different power allocation strategies and their impact on system performance metrics such as throughput, fairness, and energy consumption are critical design considerations, although the provided digests primarily describe the channel– inversion approach and note its benefit in balancing throughput and fairness [19]. For multi–user systems, particularly in contexts like mmWave–NOMA, power allocation is often intertwined with user pairing strategies [17].  

The achievable data rates for users in a PD-NOMA cluster depend on their allocated power coefficients (α) and channel gains $( \mid { \mathsf { h } } \mid ^ { 2 } )$ . For a two–user scenario where user m has poorer channel conditions than user n and thus is allocated higher power, the data rate for user m (decoding while treating user n’s signal as noise) and user n (decoding after canceling user $\mathsf { m } ^ { \prime }$ ’s signal) can be expressed as:  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { \displaystyle R _ { m 1 } = \log _ { 2 } \Biggl ( 1 + \frac { \rho | h _ { m } | ^ { 2 } \alpha _ { m } ^ { 2 } } { \rho | h _ { m } | ^ { 2 } \alpha _ { n } ^ { 2 } + 1 } \Biggr ) } } \\ { { \displaystyle R _ { n 1 } = \log _ { 2 } \Biggl ( 1 + \rho | h _ { n } | ^ { 2 } \alpha _ { n } ^ { 2 } \Biggr ) } } \end{array}
$$  

where $\boldsymbol { \rho }$ is the transmit SNR, hₘ and $\mathsf { h } \boxtimes$ are the channel gains, and $\mathsf { a } \bigotimes ^ { 2 }$ and $\mathsf { a } \bigotimes ^ { 2 }$ are the power allocation coefficients suc that $\mathsf { a } \bigstar ^ { 2 } > \mathsf { a } \bigstar ^ { 2 }$ for $\mathbb { X } h \mathbb { X } \mathbb { X } ^ { 2 } < \mathbb { X } h \mathbb { X } \mathbb { X } ^ { 2 }$ and $a \big | \big | ^ { 2 } + { \mathsf { a } } \big | \big | ^ { 2 } = 1$ (assuming normalized power). The sum rate is  

$$
R _ { N O M A } = R _ { m 1 } + R _ { n 1 }
$$  

[33].​  

Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) is indispensable for decoding the superimposed signals at the receiver in PDNOMA systems [1,33]. SIC leverages the power differences between user signals to sequentially decode them [1]. The general principle involves a receiver first decoding the signal intended for the user with the highest power (typically the weakest user in the cluster), treating other users’ signals as noise. Once decoded, this signal is reconstructed and subtracted from the received superimposed signal. The receiver then proceeds to decode the signal with the next highest power from the remaining interference, and this process continues successively until the user's own signal is decoded [1]. Users with strong channels (low allocated power) must perform SIC to remove the interference from users with weak  

channels (high allocated power) before decoding their own signal. Users with weak channels (high allocated power) may decode their signal directly, depending on the decoding order [1].  

The performance of SIC is significantly influenced by the decoding order. The decision on the SIC decoding order can be based on various factors, primarily Channel State Information (CSI) and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements [1]. Three common SIC decoding order decision schemes are identified: (1) a CSI–based scheme, which prioritizes decoding signals for users with poorer CSI conditions first; (2) a QoS–based scheme, where the decoding order is dictated by the priority levels derived from users’ QoS demands; and (3) a comprehensive scheme that considers a joint evaluation of both the user's CSI and QoS requirements to determine the decoding sequence [1]. Analyzing the performance and complexity trade–offs among these different SIC ordering schemes is crucial for system optimization.​  

The reliability and performance of PD-NOMA, particularly the effectiveness of SIC, are sensitive to the accuracy of CSI. Imperfect CSI can lead to inaccurate power allocation at the transmitter and incomplete or erroneous interference cancellation at the receiver, degrading throughput and increasing error rates. While the provided digests indicate that CSI is a factor in SIC decoding order and is relevant in security considerations (e.g., optimizing precoding and SIC sequences when eavesdropper CSI is unavailable [39]), a detailed analysis of the specific impact of imperfect CSI on SIC performance and the overall system reliability of PD-NOMA based on the provided digests is limited. Addressing the challenges posed by imperfect CSI is an ongoing research area aimed at enhancing the robustness of PD-NOMA systems.  

# 4.2 Code-Domain NOMA (CD-NOMA)  

Code-Domain Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (CD-NOMA) represents a class of NOMA techniques that achieve user multiplexing by assigning distinct, non-orthogonal spreading codes to users within the same time and frequency resources. A fundamental principle underlying CD-NOMA is the utilization of user-specific spreading codes—often characterized by low density and sparse structures or non-orthogonal cross-correlation properties with low correlation coefficients [33]—that facilitate the superposition of multiple user signals in the code domain while enabling the receiver to distinguish them through advanced detection techniques.

Prominent examples of CD-NOMA schemes include Low Density Spreading CDMA (LDS-CDMA), Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA), and Pattern Division Multiple Access (PDMA) [33].  

SCMA is a key representative of CD-NOMA, where data bits are mapped directly onto sparse multi-dimensional codewords from a shared codebook before superposition. The sparsity of the codebook is crucial, as it enables a form of nonorthogonal multiplexing that can accommodate more users than the available orthogonal resources, thereby achieving overload capability. The sparse nature of the codewords inherently limits the interference experienced by any given user to a small subset of others, which benefits receiver design.  

At the receiver, detecting the superposed signals in CD-NOMA—particularly in SCMA systems—necessitates sophisticated multi-user detection (MUD) algorithms. For SCMA, the Message Passing Algorithm (MPA) is a widely adopted approach for joint decoding [33]. MPA leverages the sparse structure of the codebook mapping, often visualized as a factor graph, to iteratively exchange probabilistic information between variable nodes (representing code layer symbols or bits) and factor nodes (representing resource blocks). This iterative process aims to estimate the transmitted codewords for all users. While MUD algorithms like MPA introduce computational complexity, the sparsity of the code structure in SCMA helps mitigate this complexity compared to dense spreading schemes, resulting in a relatively low decoding complexity for sparse codes.  

The performance of CD-NOMA schemes such as SCMA is evaluated based on metrics like spectral efficiency and overload capability. By allowing more users than available orthogonal dimensions, SCMA inherently provides significant overload capabilities. Efficient MUD algorithms, such as MPA, are designed to resolve the multi-user interference introduced by nonorthogonal spreading, thereby enhancing spectral efficiency compared to orthogonal multiple access schemes—especially in scenarios with high user density.  

A comparison of specific CD-NOMA techniques like SCMA and MUSA (Multi-User Shared Access) reveals distinct characteristics. SCMA utilizes multi-dimensional sparse codebooks for direct codeword mapping, while MUSA typically employs spreading sequences with repetition coding. Both aim for overload capability through non-orthogonal access and rely on iterative receivers; however, their code construction and associated decoding graph structures differ, which impacts implementation complexity and performance trade-offs. Nonetheless, the core principle of code-domain multiplexing—with properties like sparsity or low correlation—coupled with advanced MUD remains central to the efficacy of CD-NOMA techniques in supporting the requirements of intelligent 6G networks for massive connectivity and high throughput [33].  

# 4.3 Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)  

Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is emerging as a promising physical layer technique for future wireless networks, particularly for 6G, distinguished by its flexible approach to interference management [1,19,31]. It functions as a sophisticated interference management strategy capable of dynamically adapting user signal decoding based on varying interference power levels, thereby improving network capabilities [19]. RSMA is characterized by its ability to balance the two extreme approaches to interference handling: completely treating interference as noise (akin to Orthogonal Multiple Access, OMA) and completely decoding interference (partially implemented in Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access, NOMA) [1]. Consequently, RSMA is considered a scheme that unifies and generalizes concepts found in both OMA and NOMA [39].  

![](images/6bcd2a51f75567d582e666eb9514c81c5833d330f44c5666a7822961b3160beb.jpg)  

The core principle of RSMA involves splitting each user's intended message into common and private parts [1,4,5]. For downlink transmission, the common parts from all scheduled users are superimposed and jointly encoded into a single common data stream at the base station. Simultaneously, the private part for each user is encoded separately into a unique private data stream [1,4,5]. At the receiving end, each user first attempts to decode the common data stream. During this initial decoding stage, all private data streams intended for other users are treated as noise. Upon successful decoding of the common stream, users employ Serial Interference Cancellation (SIC) to remove the contribution of the common stream from the received signal. After eliminating the common stream interference, the user then proceeds to decode its own private data stream, treating the remaining private streams of other users as noise [1,4,5]. This mechanism of splitting messages and enabling partial interference decoding and cancellation through SIC is fundamental to RSMA's interference management capabilities [4,5].​  

By enabling partial interference decoding, RSMA offers significant performance benefits, particularly in interference-limited environments and heterogeneous networks, which are characteristic of dense 6G deployments. Studies indicate that RSMA can substantially improve spectral efficiency and energy efficiency compared to traditional approaches [4,5]. The ability to adjust the ratio of common and private stream information allows for flexible interference management between users [1]. This adaptability allows RSMA to outperform schemes like OMA and NOMA in certain conditions by optimally balancing the trade-off between treating interference as noise and decoding it. Although detailed analyses of achievable rate regions and fairness properties compared to NOMA and OMA were not extensively detailed in the digests, the underlying principle of flexible interference management through partial decoding suggests potential for superior performance and enhanced fairness, especially when dealing with diverse channel conditions and user demands. Furthermore, RSMA provides a unified framework that can encompass the functionalities of NOMA and Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA), enabling the study and comparison of these different multiple access schemes within a common structure [39].  

Despite its advantages, the implementation of RSMA presents certain challenges, notably concerning the optimization of rate allocation and message splitting. Effective interference management and performance maximization in RSMA systems rely heavily on optimally determining how much of each user's message should be assigned to the common part versus the private part, as well as the corresponding power and rate allocation for these streams. Optimizing precoding vectors is also crucial, for instance, to ensure secure transmission of users' private information by reducing eavesdropping risks [39]. The process involves complex optimization problems to determine the optimal splitting ratios and precoding matrices to achieve desired performance metrics like sum rate, fairness, and energy efficiency under varying channel conditions and network loads. The unified security transmission framework based on RSMA highlights the complexity of adjusting various parameters and conditions to meet system requirements and enhance overall performance across different scenarios [39].

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is actively being investigated for integration with a variety of emerging wireless communication technologies to enhance network performance and resource utilization [12,33]. A primary direction involves combining NOMA with Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) techniques, commonly referred to as MIMO-NOMA. Multiantenna technology inherent to MIMO provides an additional spatial domain dimension, crucial for improving future communication systems [1]. The integration of MIMO with NOMA is considered a significant area of research in both academia and industry [1]. This combination aims to leverage the spatial multiplexing and diversity gains offered by MIMO to further improve system performance and increase the number of simultaneously connected users [1,27]. A key challenge in MIMO-NOMA is that the performance of successive interference cancellation (SIC) significantly depends on the decoding order of user messages, which necessitates joint design with the beamformer [1]. Unlike Single-Input Single-Output (SISO)- NOMA, where signal and interference power are determined solely by scalar channel gains allowing decoding order optimization through channel sorting, in MIMO-NOMA, signal power is a function of both the matrix channel (or vector channel) and the beamformer [1]. This interdependency gives rise to a new joint optimization problem involving beamformers and resource allocation [1]. Research in MIMO-NOMA largely focuses on two aspects: Beamforming, where base stations calculate beamformer weights based on a predefined order to meet user quality-of-service (QoS) constraints; and User Clustering, where users are grouped and appropriate beams are designed for each cluster [1].​  

The integration of NOMA with millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications is also under exploration [17,33]. This combination is relevant for addressing the challenges of high-frequency bands, particularly in directional transmissions [17]. Specific challenges in mmWave NOMA include joint beamforming, user pairing, and power allocation in the context of highly directional beams [17]. Effectively managing these aspects is critical to mitigating path loss and exploiting the wide bandwidth available at mmWave frequencies.  

NOMA is also being considered for massive Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, characterized by a large number of devices requiring sporadic access [18]. To accommodate the massive connectivity demand, grant-free NOMA approaches are being investigated, such as the Non-orthogonal Massive Grant-Free Access (NoMaGFA) scheme, which combines random access (RA) and NOMA principles [18]. Such approaches aim to reduce signaling overhead associated with grant-based access, which is crucial for improving access efficiency and potentially energy efficiency for battery-constrained IoT devices.  

Beyond MIMO, mmWave, and massive IoT, NOMA is being explored for integration with a range of other technologies expected to be foundational for 6G networks [12]. These include Terahertz (THz) communications, backscatter communications (BackCom), intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), and mobile edge computing (MEC) [12]. Cooperative communication, considered vital for mitigating signal attenuation and extending network coverage by providing diversity gain, can be combined with NOMA to further expand the scale of user access. Cooperative NOMA often employs strong users as Decode and Forward (DF) relays to assist weak users [1]. Multi-point coordinated (CoMP) transmission technology, designed to serve cellular edge users using multiple base stations, can be combined with NOMA to enhance cellular network spectrum efficiency [1]. The synergy between Cognitive Radio (CR) and NOMA is also being explored, as both technologies aim to improve spectrum utilization efficiency – CR through opportunistic or cooperative access and NOMA through power multiplexing [1]. Integrating NOMA with IRS, such as in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks, has shown potential to improve coverage and spectrum efficiency. IRS-assisted uplink transmission schemes can facilitate communication between ground stations and satellites via NOMA, and support direct and blocked users through spatial division multiple access (SDMA) and IRS-assisted NOMA respectively, potentially maximizing ergodic rate with low complexity [20]. Furthermore, the integration of MEC and NOMA allows offloading computational tasks to nearby edge servers, supporting applications with high data processing demands [19]. NOMA is also recognized as a suitable multiple access scheme for indoor Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems, providing sufficient bandwidth [33]. Overall, integrating NOMA with these diverse technologies holds the potential to enhance resource utilization, improve spectral and energy efficiency, expand coverage, and meet the diverse performance requirements of future wireless systems.​  

# 4.5 Security Considerations in NOMA  

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) introduces specific security challenges primarily stemming from its non-orthogonal nature and the successive interference cancellation (SIC) process at receivers [39].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Security Aspect</td><td>NOMA Challenge / Vulnerability</td><td>Mitigation Techniques</td></tr><tr><td>Confidentiality</td><td>Eavesdropping due to non- orthogonal resource sharing</td><td>Physical Layer Security (PLS), Precoding optimization, SlC order adjustment</td></tr><tr><td>Receiver Integrity</td><td>SIC imperfections lead to decoding errors/leakage</td><td>Robust receiver design, Accurate CSl estimation</td></tr><tr><td>Network Integrity</td><td>Potential for malicious interference / jamming</td><td>Advanced interference management, Secure signaling</td></tr><tr><td>Data Privacy</td><td>Access to others' signals during SIC (partial)</td><td>Secure protocols, Privacy- enhancing techniques (e.g., in FL)</td></tr><tr><td>Enhanced Protection</td><td></td><td>Full-Duplex (FD) Relays, Artificial Noise Injection</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The inherent broadcast nature of wireless channels, coupled with the fact that multiple users share the same time‐ frequency resources and need to decode signals intended for others (at least partially) before decoding their own, makes NOMA systems particularly vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks [39]. An eavesdropper, potentially with strong decoding capabilities, could exploit the power domain multiplexing and the structure of SIC to gain unauthorized access to user data.  

To address these vulnerabilities, physical layer security techniques have been investigated as a means to enhance the confidentiality of NOMA transmissions against eavesdroppers [39]. One approach involves designing sophisticated anti eavesdropping schemes based on optimizing transmission parameters. Specifically, precoding optimization has been explored as a technique to shape the transmitted signals in such a way that the confidential information is protected from potential eavesdroppers while ensuring legitimate users can still decode their intended messages [39]. Furthermore, adjusting the sequence of SIC operations at legitimate receivers can also be leveraged to impact the eavesdropper's ability to decode messages, thereby serving as an anti‐eavesdropping measure [39].​  

Another strategy to bolster NOMA security involves the use of network components like full‐duplex (FD) relays [39]. These relays can simultaneously receive information from a source or other users and transmit signals, including potentially artificial interference or noise, to hinder eavesdropping [39]. The deployment of FD relays can assist secure users by forwarding their information while simultaneously transmitting jamming signals directed at the eavesdropper. Critical to the effectiveness of this approach is the careful design of precoding vectors at the relay node. These vectors must be optimized to ensure that the artificial interference generated to disrupt eavesdropping does not adversely affect the reception quality at legitimate receivers [39]. Such techniques, including precoding and strategic interference management, are crucial for improving the confidentiality and overall physical layer security performance in NOMA networks [39].  

# 5. Spatial Domain Multiple Access and Massive MIMO  

Spatial Domain Multiple Access (SDMA) is a fundamental technique in wireless communications that leverages the spatial dimension to serve multiple users simultaneously using the same time and frequency resources. This is achieved by employing antenna arrays to create directional beams, steering energy towards specific users while minimizing interference to others located in different spatial directions. By exploiting the spatial separation of users, SDMA significantly enhances spectral efficiency, allowing for higher network capacity.  

A cornerstone technology enabling advanced SDMA and crucial for 5G and beyond networks is Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (Massive MIMO) [23,40]. Massive MIMO systems deploy a very large number of antennas, typically hundreds or even thousands, at the base station or access points [37,40]. This large-scale antenna deployment offers substantial improvements in spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, coverage area, and link reliability by exploiting spatial diversity and enabling sophisticated beamforming capabilities [29,31,40]. The technology leverages the uncorrelated spatial locations of users to enhance signal strength and minimize interference through precise beamforming, benefiting both ground users and potentially cellular-connected devices like UAVs [40]. While 5G Massive MIMO has demonstrated significant gains with antenna counts reaching into the hundreds, future 6G systems aim to scale this further, pushing towards ultra-massive or Giga-MIMO with thousands of elements to meet extreme data rate demands and enable ultra-localized coverage [7,11,37].  

![](images/08a39999cffe5dcd6e4d3426fc67af0ed95611bb712a53bab3aa403c3fe8d98c.jpg)  

The architecture of Massive MIMO is evolving from centralized base stations towards more distributed and cooperative paradigms. This evolution includes centralized Massive MIMO, where a large array is at a single site, to distributed Massive MIMO, and eventually to the Cell-Free Massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) architecture [11,13,16,29,42]. CF-mMIMO represents a significant shift by distributing a large number of access points (APs) across a service area, jointly serving users without predefined cell boundaries [8,29,31,42]. This distributed nature inherently eliminates inter-cell interference and provides uniform, high-quality service across the entire network, mitigating the edge-of-cell issues prevalent in traditional cellular systems [13,23,42]. CF-mMIMO also enhances macro-diversity and improves signal reception by allowing users to be served by multiple APs simultaneously [23,42]. While offering superior performance, CF-mMIMO introduces complexity in coordinating distributed APs for joint channel estimation, precoding, and decoding, as well as significant backhaul requirements and the need for precise synchronization and calibration [13,23].​  

Effective beamforming is critical for realizing the potential of Massive MIMO and SDMA. Various techniques, such as Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT), Zero-Forcing (ZF), and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), are employed for multiuser precoding and interference mitigation [17]. The choice of beamforming technique involves trade-offs between complexity, performance, and the amount of Channel State Information (CSI) required. Accurately acquiring and utilizing CSI is a major challenge in Massive MIMO systems, particularly given the large number of antennas. Pilot contamination, where pilots from different cells or users interfere with channel estimation, can significantly degrade performance, especially in time-division duplex (TDD) systems that rely on channel reciprocity. While channel hardening in Massive MIMO can simplify some aspects of precoding, simply increasing antenna numbers might not always linearly improve capacity beyond a certain point due to this phenomenon [21].​  

Further performance enhancements and new capabilities for Massive MIMO in 6G are being explored through integration with other emerging technologies. Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) or Intelligent Operating Surfaces (IOS) can reconfigure the wireless propagation environment by intelligently reflecting or refracting signals, effectively creating programmable channels [21,37,42]. Integrating IRS/IOS with Massive MIMO helps overcome blockage issues prevalent at higher frequencies like millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz), enhancing signal strength, extending coverage, and aiding interference management and localization [21,24,37,42]. Additionally, Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), such as LEO satellites, can be integrated with CF-mMIMO systems to provide supplementary coverage and capacity, particularly in challenging environments or areas with sparse ground infrastructure [8,20]. This satellite-assisted approach can significantly boost downlink rates and extend network reach [8]. The combination of Massive MIMO with these technologies is also foundational for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), enabling precise sensing and positioning capabilities alongside communication [7,8,23,24]. However, integrating Massive MIMO with these technologies presents new challenges, such as the complex joint optimization of Massive MIMO beamforming with IRS phase shifts or coordinating ground and satellite elements in NTN integrations. Future work focuses on developing low-complexity algorithms, optimizing performance in dynamic environments, and addressing calibration and synchronization issues inherent in these advanced distributed and hybrid systems [13].​  

# 5.1 Cell-Free Massive MIMO  

Cell-Free Massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) is recognized as a highly promising architectural paradigm for future 6G wireless communication networks, representing a significant departure from traditional cellular network structures [29,31,42].  

![](images/70fdc60985b81f3cf1a85581cf386266c3647ae05328d7cfeae853025359da29.jpg)  

Unlike cellular systems where users are served by a single base station associated with a specific cell, CF-mMIMO employs a large number of geographically distributed access points (APs) that jointly serve users across a wide area [31]. This distributed nature fundamentally eliminates cell boundaries and, consequently, inter-cell interference, a major performance bottleneck in cellular networks, leading to a substantial increase in overall network capacity [23].​  

A primary advantage of CF-mMIMO is its capacity to provide uniform and consistent service quality across the entire network coverage area, mitigating the edge-of-cell performance degradation experienced in cellular systems [42]. By leveraging joint transmission and reception from multiple APs, users benefit from increased macro diversity and improved signal reception quality, as remote radio units can obtain target echo information from various access points [23,42]. This approach enhances system performance and supports a greater number of users compared to traditional cellular Massive MIMO systems [29,42]. CF-mMIMO also offers potential improvements in spectral and energy efficiency [42]. A user-centric design variant allows each user device to be served by a set of APs with the most favorable channel conditions, further optimizing performance [42].  

While offering significant advantages, CF-mMIMO introduces complex signal processing challenges. These include the need for joint channel estimation, precoding, and decoding operations that must be coordinated across numerous distributed APs. The processing of data, especially for functions like tracking, positioning, and imaging in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, necessitates multi-node collaboration and coordinated computing among base stations to meet accuracy requirements [23]. Practical implementation challenges also arise, such as ensuring precise synchronization across geographically separated APs, maintaining accurate channel state information through effective calibration procedures, and managing the substantial backhaul requirements needed to connect the distributed APs to a central processing unit for coordinated operations.​  

The inherent performance gains of CF-mMIMO compared to conventional cellular systems, particularly in terms of capacity and uniform user experience, make it a compelling candidate for 6G [23,29,42]. Furthermore, the integration of nonterrestrial network components, such as satellites, can provide an additional layer of coverage and capacity enhancement for CF-mMIMO systems [8]. A satellite-assisted CF-mMIMO system, potentially supporting ISAC, can leverage Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to provide supplementary communication resources to ground users [8]. Simulation results indicate that such integration can notably improve the downlink average rate, especially in scenarios where the density of ground APs is limited or when satellite antennas are densely deployed, thereby extending coverage and boosting performance in challenging environments [8].​  

# 5.2 Massive MIMO Integration with Intelligent Surfaces (IRS/IOS)  

Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS), also referred to as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) or Intelligent Operating Surfaces (IOS), represent a transformative technology poised to revolutionize wireless communication by intelligently reconfiguring the propagation environment [42]. Physically, RIS is typically a planar two-dimensional structure comprising multiple layers, with the outermost layer featuring passive elements capable of reflecting or refracting incoming signals. These elements can be dynamically programmed in real time to control the phase shifts of incident waves [37]. This programmable nature allows IRS/IOS to effectively create a desired channel state, turning previously uncontrolled propagation paths into programmable ones [42]. Compared to traditional active relays, IRS/IOS are characterized by their large size, passive operation, low cost, low power consumption, and ease of deployment, making them suitable for building ubiquitous near-field wireless environments in future 6G networks [21,37].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Benefit Category</td><td>Specific Advantage with IRS Integration</td><td>Relevance to Massive MIMO / High Freq.</td></tr><tr><td>Signal Enhancement</td><td>Overcome Blockages, Create Virtual LoS Paths, Increase Gain</td><td>Crucial for mmWave/THz path loss/blockage</td></tr><tr><td>Coverage Extension</td><td>Extend Signal Range, Expand Coverage Area</td><td>Enhance ubiquitous connectivity</td></tr><tr><td>Interference Mgmt.</td><td>Direct Desired Signals, Steer Unwanted Signals Away</td><td>Improve SINR, Support dense users</td></tr><tr><td>Channel Control</td><td>Reconfigure Propagation Environment, Create Programmable Channels</td><td>Facilitate Beamforming, Adaptability</td></tr><tr><td>Localization</td><td>Enhance Accuracy by directing signals</td><td>Support ISAC and precise positioning</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Integrating IRS/IOS with Massive MIMO systems offers significant advantages. Massive MIMO leverages a large number of antennas at the base station to achieve high spatial multiplexing gains and beamforming capabilities. By deploying IRS/IOS, the wireless channel can be intelligently modified to complement the Massive MIMO capabilities. This combination facilitates the creation of virtual line-of-sight (LoS) paths, which is crucial in scenarios where direct paths are blocked,  

particularly for high-frequency millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) signals that suffer from high free space path loss and susceptibility to blockages [37]. IRS/IOS can effectively mitigate such blocking by reflecting signals around obstacles, thereby enhancing signal strength, extending signal range, and expanding coverage [37,42]. Furthermore, IRS/IOS can assist in interference management by directing desired signals towards users and unwanted signals away, enhancing security and localization accuracy by reflecting signals in narrow beams to specific locations without causing interference [24,37]. Studies have shown that integrating IRS into Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RAN) can significantly enhance capacity and coverage, and joint optimization of transmit beamforming and IRS passive beamforming can improve the uplink rate [9].​  

Despite the promising benefits, integrating a large number of IRS/IOS elements presents significant challenges, primarily related to their optimal configuration and control. Efficiently optimizing the phase shifts of potentially thousands or millions of passive elements to achieve the desired channel state is a complex problem. Sophisticated optimization techniques, such as successive convex approximation for joint optimization problems involving transmit beamforming and IRS passive beamforming, are being investigated to address this challenge [9]. The integration of Intelligent Operating Surfaces (IOS), which may offer more dynamic control or sensing capabilities compared to purely reflective surfaces, holds potential for providing additional signal paths and further expanding coverage, allowing for customization of signals from different objects to enhance sensing and positioning accuracy [42].​  

# 6. Grant-Free and Random Access Techniques  

rant-free multiple access (GFMA) is recognized as a fundamental enabling technology for 6G networks, particularly in cenarios characterized by massive machine-type communications (mMTC) and sporadic traffic patterns [4,5,15].  

Unlike traditional grant-based approaches that require explicit scheduling requests and grants from the base station before data transmission, GFMA allows devices to transmit data packets immediately upon activation or availability, adhering to an "arrive and transmit" strategy [1,19,38]. This non-interactive principle significantly reduces the control channel signaling overhead and network coordination required for each transmission [1,5].  

The key benefits of GFMA stem directly from this departure from the conventional access paradigm. By eliminating the multistep handshake process, GFMA drastically reduces access latency, which is critical for delay-sensitive applications in 6G [35]. Furthermore, the reduced signaling overhead alleviates network overload and congestion, enabling the network to support a substantially higher number of connected devices, thereby meeting the ultra-large-scale connection density requirements of mMTC [4,38]. GFMA also contributes to enhanced energy efficiency, a vital consideration for resource-constrained IoT devices [25,38]. This approach is particularly suitable for Very Large Connection Density (VLBC) scenarios where orthogonal multiple access schemes would incur unsustainable signaling burdens [33]. The utility of grant-free access extends to facilitating efficient data aggregation in distributed applications like federated learning for IoT, by enabling direct upload of model parameters [26].​  

Various GFMA schemes have been proposed to address the specific challenges and leverage the opportunities presented by massive connectivity in 6G. One notable scheme is Uncoordinated Random Access and Transmission (URAT), designed for ultra-massive connectivity scenarios [5]. URAT simplifies the access process by merging initial access and multi-access data transmission into a single step, utilizing non-orthogonal transmission and eliminating the need for network confirmation or explicit resource scheduling [5]. In URAT, terminals prepare and send data packets alongside a preamble signal carrying metadata bits to aid user differentiation, transmitting periodically until successful reception or network feedback [5].​  

Compressive Sensing (CS)-based GFMA (CS-GFMA) represents another class of solutions, leveraging techniques from sparse signal recovery [16]. CS-GFMA relies on the inherent sparsity of active users in a massive network (only a small fraction of devices are active at any given time) to perform joint user activity detection and data decoding at the receiver, even when multiple users transmit simultaneously on the same resources [16].  

Resource Hopping Multiple Access (RHMA) is a GFMA scheme specifically designed for massive IoT, employing resource hopping sequences to mitigate collisions [3]. In RHMA, user data is segmented and mapped onto different channel resources following specific hopping patterns, which helps avoid collisions and increases the number of effectively accessible users, particularly valuable in dynamic environments or training scenarios like federated learning [26,38].​  

Contention-based Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is also considered a form of GFMA, enabling "truly grant-free" access through techniques like successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver to separate superimposed signals from multiple users transmitting on the same resource [15,33]. Other schemes like User-centric Multiple Access (UMA) are positioned within the GFMA framework, emphasizing suitability for massive connectivity and handling uncoordinated transmissions [25]. For specific scenarios like asynchronous transmissions in satellite-based IoT, schemes combining random access and NOMA, such as Non-orthogonal Massive Grant-Free Access (NoMaGFA), have been proposed to enhance robustness under varying traffic conditions [18].  

Despite the significant advantages, implementing GFMA for massive IoT presents notable challenges. A primary concern is the increased collision probability that arises when numerous devices transmit without coordination [33]. Furthermore, the detection and decoding process at the base station is complex, requiring robust algorithms for joint user activity detection, channel estimation, and data decoding, especially under heavy traffic loads or severe interference conditions [16]. The performance of GFMA schemes is critically dependent on the receiver's ability to efficiently resolve collisions and recover data from active users, which can be computationally intensive. Managing performance trade-offs between connection density, throughput, latency, and energy efficiency under diverse and dynamic traffic loads remains an active area of research.  

# 6.1 Grant-Free Access for Massive IoT  

Grant-free multiple access (GFMA) techniques are poised to play a crucial role in supporting the unprecedented scale of massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices in 6G networks [15,16].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Benefit</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Reduced Signaling Overhead</td><td>Eliminates request/grant handshake,crucial for massive sporadic traffic</td></tr><tr><td>Lower Access Latency</td><td>Devices transmit immediately upon activation</td></tr><tr><td>Massive Connectivity</td><td>Supports large number of devices accessing simultaneously</td></tr><tr><td>Enhanced Energy Efficiency</td><td>Less signaling reduces device power consumption, beneficial for loT devices</td></tr><tr><td>Supports Federated Learning</td><td>Efficient upload of model updates from distributed devices</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The inherent characteristics of massive machine-type communications (mMTC)—such as a vast number of low-power devices transmitting sporadic, small packets—necessitate access schemes that can significantly reduce the conventional signaling overhead of grant-based access [38]. GFMA directly addresses this need by allowing devices to transmit data without prior scheduling requests, thereby improving communication efficiency and supporting the simultaneous connection of a large number of devices [38]. This approach is particularly suitable for scenarios requiring very large connection density (VLBC), where orthogonal multiple access schemes would incur unsustainable signaling overhead [33]. Furthermore, GFMA contributes to enhanced energy efficiency—a critical requirement for resource-constrained IoT devices [25]. The application of grant-free access has also been explored to accelerate federated learning in IoT by enabling the direct upload of model parameters, which reduces communication burdens and improves data privacy [26].​  

While GFMA offers significant advantages for massive IoT, its implementation faces challenges. Specifically, handling user activity detection and data decoding becomes complex when a massive number of devices transmit sporadically and collisions occur. Without explicit grants, the receiver must jointly estimate which users are active and decode their data, a process that can be computationally intensive.​  

Various GFMA schemes have been proposed to meet the unique requirements of massive IoT. For instance, User-centric Multiple Access (UMA) is discussed in the context of mMTC in 6G, focusing on its ability to support high connection density and energy efficiency [25]. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) schemes are highlighted as more suitable than their orthogonal counterparts for VLBC in massive IoT, precisely because they avoid the unsustainable signaling overhead associated with orthogonal schemes [33]. For asynchronous transmissions—particularly relevant in distributed environments such as satellite-based IoT—schemes like NoMaGFA have been proposed [18].​  

Although a direct comparative analysis of performance metrics (such as latency, connection density under specific load conditions, and achievable energy efficiency) is limited based on the provided information, the consensus from the analyzed literature is clear: GFMA is a fundamental enabler for the massive connectivity and efficiency demands of 6G IoT.  

# 7. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) Multiple Access  

![](images/75224b9c3fb1f0bcb4d7161913c7abea93df9c815ccb703b6157229d64de935d.jpg)  

Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) represents a significant paradigm shift in 6G networks, moving away from the traditional separation of sensing (e.g., radar) and communication functionalities towards their deep integration [1,13,23,34,36]. This convergence is driven by technological advancements in areas such as ultra-massive antennas and millimeter-wave communications [36]. ISAC aims to more effectively utilize congested wireless and hardware resources, potentially achieving synergistic enhancements between sensing and communication functions while also reducing device weight [1,23]. In 6G, ISAC is envisioned as a key technology enabling an entirely new wave of use cases and devices [1,34], where devices like mobile phones or base stations can simultaneously perform environmental detection and sensing tasks alongside communication [13]. The sensing function serves as a source of network environment information, supporting applications that require wide-area multi-dimensional sensing and the acquisition of motion and spatial information about both connected and unconnected objects [13,36].​  

The integration of sensing and communication places unique demands on multiple access design, particularly the need to efficiently share or jointly utilize resources such as spectrum, space, and hardware payload [13,34]. A core challenge lies in reconciling the often conflicting objectives of communication performance and sensing accuracy and coordinating resources effectively [21]. This necessitates research into whether frequencies, antennas, and radio frequency links can be reused and whether signal design criteria for sensing and communication can be compromised [13]. Additionally, potential issues like spectrum overlap, where radar signals can affect communication quality, must be addressed [8]. The integration also requires robust computing power support and assistance, with computing serving as the means to integrate and mine multi-agent shared information [13]. AI-based interpretation of sensing results and scalable mechanisms for distributing these results are also crucial [34].​  

Various approaches are being explored to realize ISAC. One fundamental aspect involves the design of unified waveforms, hardware architectures, and signal processing algorithms to achieve a balance between communication and sensing performance [24]. Resource allocation strategies are vital for optimizing the trade-off between the two functionalities [21].  

Specific multiple access techniques and enabling technologies are being evaluated for their suitability and capabilities in supporting ISAC functionalities. Massive MIMO technology, for instance, is highly relevant due to its ability to reduce beamwidth and achieve high spatial resolution, which translates to high-resolution sensing and high positioning accuracy services [23,42]. Building upon this, satellite-assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems are being proposed as architectures for ISAC, specifically modeled to address challenges like spectrum overlap and allowing for the derivation of achievable rate expressions for downlink users in complex fading channels [8]. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), also referred to as Intelligent Omni-Surfaces (IOS), offer enhancements for ISAC, particularly in near-field scenarios [21,42]. Their characteristics enable simultaneous angle and distance parameter estimation, construction of line-of-sight (LoS) channels, increased beamforming gain, improved coverage, and overcoming multipath interference, while also supporting flexible resource scheduling [21]. However, challenges remain in optimizing RIS/IOS configurations and decision functions to reconcile communication and sensing objectives [21,42]. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is also considered for integration with ISAC, particularly to meet the dual requirements of transmission efficiency and security in Internet of  

Things (IoT) scenarios [1,19]. ISAC can potentially introduce new Channel State Information (CSI) acquisition mechanisms that could improve the transmission quality of NOMA systems [1].  

Beyond traditional radio frequencies, ISAC is also being explored in other domains. ISAC-OW (optical wireless) extends wireless communication with integrated sensing and positioning functionalities, particularly suitable for use cases in EMFfree environments [24]. This approach utilizes optical links and aims to balance communication and sensing performance through unified design principles. Use cases include transmitting real-time videos and performing contactless health monitoring like heartbeat and breathing detection [24]. Performance metrics demonstrated in ISAC-OW systems include high-speed video transmission rates, centimeter-level precision for indoor localization, and heartbeat/breathing monitoring accuracy comparable to smart watches [24].​  

The capabilities provided by 6G ISAC enable a wide range of new applications, leveraging the network's ability to perform high-precision positioning and related sensing functions such as distance/speed/angle evaluation, object state monitoring, imaging, and mapping [36]. These use cases include auxiliary navigation, various forms of activity detection and motion tracking (e.g., pose/gesture recognition, fall detection, vehicle/pedestrian detection), environmental monitoring (e.g., rainfall/pollution), and providing crucial environmental sensing data for applications like AI, Extended Reality (XR), and digital twins [7,13,34,36].​  

# 8. Role of AI and Machine Learning in Multiple Access  

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are identified as foundational and transformative technologies for enabling intelligent multiple access techniques in future 6G networks [13,31,36,37]. The inherent complexity, heterogeneity, and dynamic nature of 6G environments necessitate sophisticated optimization techniques that traditional methods struggle to address effectively [34]. AI/ML provides powerful tools to tackle these complex multiple access problems, moving beyond designs based on statistical stability to utilize data characteristics for personalized and optimized communication processes [13]. Machine learning and deep learning modules are becoming integral components in automated systems handling signal processing across various network layers [41].  

![](images/ac74d77ae5a62c8fefbaa7013c54f4f5ad57ffe6f1b0711e691758984e3d0c81.jpg)  

A significant application area for AI/ML in multiple access is dynamic resource allocation. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), in particular, has garnered substantial attention for enabling dynamic spectrum access and resource management in wireless networks, including satellite-terrestrial integrated networks and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications [20,32]. DRL-based dynamic channel allocation algorithms have demonstrated the potential to significantly reduce blocking probability, improve spectrum efficiency, and enhance network carrying traffic capacity [20]. For energy-constrained scenarios, such as Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, RL-based schemes can optimize channel allocation to save satellite network energy and alleviate resource scarcity [20]. Beyond traditional cellular contexts, AI, especially DRL, is being explored for spectrum and power allocation decisions in D2D-based V2V networks, addressing challenges posed by the high transmission overhead of centralized mechanisms [32]. Furthermore, multi-agent DRL has been applied to achieve endedge collaborative resource allocation, showing better adaptation to varying edge computing capabilities, data sizes, and device numbers compared to conventional DRL [9].​  

AI and ML are broadly recognized for their role in optimizing resource allocation to improve spectral and energy efficiency, increase the number of supported users, reduce energy consumption, and minimize latency [42]. Dynamic spectrum management based on cognitive intelligence, employing intelligent spectrum sensing and dynamic spectrum sharing, is considered essential for 6G [2]. DRL-based dynamic spectrum access mechanisms can leverage historical spectrum conditions to mitigate the impact of poor sensing and acquire valuable information about channel status, such as primary user behavior and secondary user load, which is crucial for collision reduction [32]. Research into dynamic spectrum access strategies also encompasses economic perspectives, aiming to maximize social welfare through AI techniques like wireless resource management and pricing [2].  

AI/ML also plays a crucial role in enhancing interference management and optimizing related aspects like user pairing and scheduling. AI can be applied directly to interference management problems [42]. In multi-antenna systems, AI can optimize user beam allocation by constructing feature vectors based on user phase and channel state information and leveraging cloud computing for offline optimization [35]. Joint design of beam scheduling and multiple access, particularly in complex environments like satellite-terrestrial integrated networks, is a future research focus, utilizing AI techniques to improve spectrum efficiency and system access capability [20]. Innovations like fast AI-driven beam management are projected to enhance capacity in dense environments [7]. AI can also address challenges in channel estimation and feedback overhead, particularly in Massive MIMO systems [42]. Research hotspots include AI-driven CSI feedback compression and beamforming based on channel prediction [13].​  

Beyond resource management and interference control, AI can optimize other physical layer aspects relevant to multiple access. AI-enabled wireless transmission technology can jointly optimize transmitter and receiver components using neural networks [35]. AI-driven channel decoding and demodulation optimization are also areas of active research [13]. Semantic communication, based on content and context awareness, represents another direction where AI integrates with the physical layer [13].​  

The vision for 6G is characterized by an emerging paradigm of AI-Native networks [13,34,36]. In this paradigm, AI is not merely an add-on but is fundamentally integrated into the network's design and operation, including the radio access network (RAN) architecture [13,35,36]. This leads to the concept of Intelligent and Concise RAN (IC-RAN) [35]. AI is expected to be ubiquitous within 6G networks [37]. This integration enables fully autonomous network operations, improving resource allocation, reducing operational costs, and facilitating AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) offerings [34,36]. AI empowers the network by leveraging inherent network elements (data, computing power, algorithms) to optimize performance, efficiency, and user experience, aiming for high degrees of autonomy [36]. Conversely, the network enables AI by providing the necessary infrastructure and support capabilities for distributed AI model training and inference, meeting the increasing demands of AI applications [36]. AI is already being explored in RAN architecture within 3GPP contexts for applications like energy saving, load balancing, and mobility optimization [37]. AI is also assisting in hardware design for optimizing components relevant to wireless transmission and solving optimization challenges like latency minimization [37]. The bidirectional integration of AI and communication technologies is a defining feature of 6G [36].​  

Applying AI/ML to multiple access offers significant benefits, including improved performance metrics such as spectral and energy efficiency, increased network capacity and user support, and reduced latency and blocking probability [20,42]. AI enables greater adaptability to highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments [2,20]. In specific contexts like federated learning for IoT, combining grant-free random access with federated learning has shown improved training speed and system stability, demonstrating better adaptability and efficiency with increasing communication rounds and robustness to random variations in user numbers [26,38]. The potential for autonomous operations and reduced operational complexity and costs is also a major driver [34,36].  

However, the application of AI/ML also presents notable challenges. These include the significant data requirements for training models, the computational complexity associated with training and inference, and the implementation constraints related to computing power [13]. A key challenge is the adaptability and generalization of AI algorithms in dynamic wireless transmission environments characterized by changing propagation conditions and load variations, which increase optimization complexity [13]. Furthermore, there is an ongoing question regarding whether AI can consistently provide stable performance gains and be cost-effective for wireless transmission optimization [13]. The need for explainability and predictability in AI-enabled wireless transmission designs, potentially addressed by incorporating expert knowledge, is also recognized [35].​  

Emerging trends include the integration of AI engines into network architectures for efficient and flexible access in largescale user scenarios like satellite-terrestrial networks [20], AI-enhanced design for satellite-based IoT [18], and the use of deep learning for tasks like contactless health monitoring leveraging wireless signals [24].  

# 9. Multiple Access in Integrated Networks and New Spectrum  

The evolution towards 6G networks necessitates the integration of diverse network segments into cohesive architectures, prominently featuring Integrated Space-Terrestrial Networks (ISTN) [34,37]. This vision extends beyond terrestrial infrastructure to encompass satellite constellations (including LEO), high-altitude platforms, drones, and potentially marine networks, forming multi-dimensional integrated coverage [2,9,36]. Such integration is crucial for achieving ubiquitous connectivity, enhancing network reliability, and bolstering resilience, particularly in disaster scenarios [36].  

Integrating these heterogeneous segments presents significant challenges for multiple access techniques and resource management. Different network components exhibit distinct communication conditions, performance requirements, and mobility patterns, leading to varying demands on resources, especially spectrum [2,42]. Unlike the predominantly planar distribution of access in current networks, spectrum allocation in integrated networks like ASGO-IN (Aero-Space-GroundOcean Integrated Network) takes on a three-dimensional, spatialized characteristic [2]. A key challenge lies in developing a unified access method and mobility management protocol capable of supporting diverse terminal types connected via heterogeneous networks [36]. Architectural solutions involving adaptation modules on the access side, utilizing components or microservices for protocol adaptation and conversion, alongside unified secure authentication, are being explored to address this [36]. Resource orchestration across cloud, network, compute, and service layers is necessary to manage the multi-dimensional resources effectively [9]. Specific integrated system architectures, such as satellite-assisted Cell-Free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems combining LEO satellites with ground CF-mMIMO networks, are proposed to enhance performance metrics like user data rates and reduce infrastructure costs [8]. Furthermore, developing multiple access schemes tailored for specific integrated scenarios, such as grant-free massive access for satellite-based IoT, is an active area of research [18].​  

![](images/db9c05a0e27d4fdefe9b44364fd82a0c9af1c611f62bc08d7389a5ed23e1636f.jpg)  

Complementing the integration of network segments, 6G leverages a significantly expanded spectrum landscape. This includes existing low, mid, and millimeter wave (mmWave) bands, augmented by new frequency allocations in the  

centimetric wave (cmWave) and sub-THz ranges [34]. Specific mid-band frequencies between 6 GHz and 15 GHz are under consideration by the ITU for potential International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) use, including bands like 4.4-4.8 GHz, 7.125-8.4 GHz, and 14.8-15.35 GHz [7]. The upper mid-band $\left( 6 { - } 8 . 5 \mathsf { G H z } \right)$ is expected to support high-performance applications, while lower bands $( < 6 \mathsf { G H z } )$ remain crucial for coverage and capacity [7]. The 7-30 GHz band is projected to be a primary range for achieving continuous 6G network coverage [21]. Spectrum sharing between new bands, such as cmWave, and legacy Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD) bands is identified as essential for early 6G deployments [34]. The optical spectrum is also being explored for wireless communication systems, offering high bandwidth and energy efficiency, potentially integrated into lighting infrastructure for applications like integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) [24]. Efficient spectrum management and dynamic allocation mechanisms, potentially leveraging technologies like blockchain and hybrid cloud for spectrum sharing among IoT devices, are vital across this diverse spectrum portfolio [2,14].  

A key component of the new spectrum for 6G is the Terahertz (THz) band, ranging from 0.1 THz to 10 THz [23,42]. THz frequencies offer unprecedented opportunities due to their ultra-large available bandwidth, enabling ultra-high-speed communication, high-resolution environment sensing, and integrated sensing and communication functionalities [23,42]. The extremely short wavelengths facilitate device miniaturization, paving the way for novel IoT applications such as wearable health monitoring and microsystem sensors [23]. However, the THz band presents significant propagation challenges, including extremely high path loss, low energy efficiency, sensitivity to blockages, phase noise, channel sparsity, and the increasing relevance of spherical wave and near-field effects [23,42].​  

To mitigate the severe path attenuation in the THz band and other high-frequency ranges (e.g., mmWave), technologies like ultra-large-scale antenna arrays (massive MIMO) are indispensable [23,42]. The combination of THz frequencies with massive MIMO is expected to counteract substantial path loss [23]. Furthermore, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), also known as intelligent metasurfaces composed of digitally programmable artificial unit arrays, are crucial for shaping the wireless environment [13,21,42]. RIS can intelligently adjust the reflection or refraction of electromagnetic waves, effectively overcoming blockage and path loss, thereby improving coverage efficiency and user rates, particularly in middle and highfrequency bands like 7-30 GHz where continuous coverage is challenging [13,21,42]. While the digests primarily highlight RIS's role in mitigating path loss and enabling coverage, they also link RIS and metasurfaces to enhancing beamforming and spatial multiplexing [13,42]. At these high frequencies and with large antenna apertures, near-field propagation effects, characterized by spherical wavefronts and spatial non-stationarity, become prominent challenges [42]. RIS has the potential to influence these near-field environments, although the precise principles of creating controlled near-field scenarios via RIS and their full impact on multiple access design require further investigation. Current research on metasurfaces highlights practical limitations, such as the full-bandwidth nature of their directional control, which can restrict multi-user spatial and frequency-selective scheduling and potentially amplify interference from adjacent networks operating in the same frequency band [13]. Proposed solutions like implementing narrowband surface units or adding filters could address these issues but may significantly increase costs [13]. The unique characteristics of integrated networks, the availability of new spectrum bands across a wide range of frequencies, and the potential to control the wireless environment using technologies like RIS, including in the near-field region, necessitate the re-evaluation and design of novel multiple access techniques capable of efficiently utilizing these opportunities while effectively mitigating the associated challenges.

The heterogeneous and demanding requirements of future 6G networks necessitate the development and application of specialized multiple access techniques tailored for distinct use cases. Among the most prominent are distributed machine learning paradigms, particularly Federated Learning (FL), and advanced communication scenarios involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).​  

Federated Learning—characterized by its distributed approach where models are trained locally on devices and only model updates are transmitted to a central server—presents significant challenges and opportunities for multiple access design in 6G networks, especially within large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) environments [26,38]. The efficient uplink transmission of model updates from potentially massive numbers of devices is critical for FL’s convergence speed and overall performance. Grant-free random access is identified as a core technology to address the challenges of large-scale IoT in 6G and beyond, facilitating edge computing and accelerating FL model training for widespread adoption [26,38]. This approach bypasses the conventional handshake procedure, allowing devices to transmit without explicit resource grants, thereby reducing access delay and signaling overhead—essential for the sporadic and massive access patterns often encountered in FL scenarios.​  

Beyond generic grant-free access, specific multiple access schemes are being investigated to optimize FL performance. Resource hopping multiple access (RHMA), combined with codebook allocation, has been proposed to enhance both communication efficiency and data privacy in federated learning systems [3]. The fundamental principle involves dividing the communication channel into multiple sub-channels and dynamically allocating multiple access codebooks based on the data characteristics and computational capabilities of the participating devices [3]. Model parameters are trained based on detected codebook collisions, enabling subsequent updates of client and server models through local loss training [3]. Although RHMA is claimed to optimize both communication efficiency and data privacy [3], the specific trade-offs between communication overhead reduction and the level of privacy preservation achieved through this collision-based approach warrant further detailed analysis. Grant-free approaches generally improve communication efficiency by reducing latency and signaling overhead, but privacy guarantees often depend on cryptographic techniques or differential privacy mechanisms layered atop the multiple access scheme, rather than being inherent to the access method itself. RHMA's collision-based training suggests a form of implicit data aggregation that may offer privacy benefits by obscuring individual device contributions, though the extent of this benefit relative to potential performance impacts (e.g., due to collisions) remains a key trade-off.  

Another critical application domain for advanced multiple access techniques in 6G is UAV communications. UAVs present unique challenges due to their high mobility and the complex air-to-ground channel characteristics—including dynamic lineof-sight probability, multipath effects, and interference from ground users. Massive MIMO technology is recognized as playing a crucial role in supporting the harmonious coexistence of cellular-connected UAVs with ground users [40]. Massive MIMO systems can provide high uplink data rates for UAVs and ensure consistent command and non-payload  

communications (CNPC) links [40] through enhanced spatial multiplexing and beamforming capabilities, which mitigate interference and adapt to the dynamic channel conditions experienced by UAVs.  

Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is also being integrated with UAV communication systems, enabling UAV base stations to support NOMA transmissions in cellular networks [1]. This integration aims to address issues such as limited available wireless resources and air-to-ground channel interference, thereby improving overall communication performance in UAV networks [1]. NOMA allows multiple users (whether UAVs or ground users served by a UAV) to share the same time/frequency resources, differentiating them by power or code domains. While this can enhance spectral efficiency, it requires sophisticated interference cancellation techniques.  

Beyond FL and UAVs, multiple access is fundamental to supporting other emerging 6G use cases. For instance, near-field communication scenarios enabled by intelligent surfaces can leverage Location-Division Multiple Access (LDMA)—a form of near-field Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA)—to serve massive IoT devices based on distinct distances within a spherical wavefront [21]. NOMA is also being applied in various domains, including integration with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) to improve task offloading efficiency and reduce latency [1], deployment into industrial Internet architectures for ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliability communication among massive concurrent nodes [1], and application in communication-aware electronic medical systems to prioritize delay-sensitive transmissions [1]. These diverse applications highlight the need for a unified multiple access theoretical framework in 6G, one that can facilitate optimized access methods tailored to specific scenario requirements by considering factors such as rate, latency, and reliability [13]. The diverse spectrum bands allocated for 6G—from sub-GHz for low-power IoT to sub-THz for high-capacity links—further underscore the necessity for adaptable multiple access techniques specific to varying propagation characteristics and application needs [7]. Specific use cases like smart healthcare and industrial automation further drive the need for multiple access schemes capable of supporting critical, often real-time, communications [24].​

The practical implementation of advanced multiple access (MA) techniques for intelligent 6G networks is hindered by several significant challenges, primarily related to computational complexity, dependence on accurate channel information, synchronization requirements, and hardware limitations.  

A major impediment is the substantial computational complexity inherent in the signal processing algorithms of many advanced MA schemes [27,28,32]. For Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), the Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) process at the receiver side is computationally intensive, particularly as the number of users multiplexed within the same resource increases [15,28,32]. The complexity of SIC is required to achieve precise space-time diversity [28]. Similarly, some Code-Domain NOMA (CD-NOMA) schemes involve complex decoding algorithms [32]. Techniques like Massive MIMO and Cell-Free (CF) Massive MIMO necessitate extensive signal processing for tasks such as beamforming, precoding, and channel estimation [17,32]. In the context of Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) and massive Machine  

Type Communication (mMTC), schemes like URAT, which employ low code rates and multi-user coding, impose high demands on time-frequency resources [5]. The analysis of different UMA coding schemes also highlights trade-offs between computational complexity and energy efficiency, which vary with access scale [25].  

Many advanced MA techniques critically depend on timely and accurate Channel State Information (CSI) for effective operation, especially for tasks like power allocation, precoding, and user scheduling [27]. This dependence introduces significant channel estimation overhead, particularly in dynamic wireless environments where CSI changes rapidly [40]. Accurate CSI updates are frequently required for systems like Massive MIMO [40].​  

Challenges also arise in managing synchronization, particularly in distributed network architectures envisioned for 6G, such as Cell-Free Massive MIMO and satellite-terrestrial integrated networks [20,42]. Ensuring seamless switching and collaborative operation between heterogeneous network components and distributed access points necessitates sophisticated synchronization and coordination mechanisms [20]. In Cell-Free systems, challenges related to the centralized computing unit and fronthaul links must be addressed [42].  

Hardware limitations pose a significant constraint on the practical implementation of advanced MA schemes [24,41]. Designers and researchers consistently face trade-offs among power consumption, delay, and integrated circuit (IC) area [41]. For large-scale MIMO and Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, the large number of antennas leads to a substantial increase in the number of radio frequency (RF) chains, resulting in high energy consumption and hardware costs—a problem exacerbated in high-frequency bands like millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) [23]. Implementing Cell-Free Massive MIMO requires consideration of energy consumption and reliance on cloud/open radio access network (C-RAN/O-RAN) architectures [42]. Challenges in ISAC also include developing unified hardware architectures for communication and localization functions [24]. The cost, overhead, and inherent complexity are identified as major hurdles for deploying extra-large scale MIMO systems [11]. NOMA implementation is also limited by the transmit power differences among users; insufficient power disparity can hinder effective signal separation by SIC [28].  

Researchers are exploring various techniques to mitigate these implementation challenges and reduce the complexity of specific MA techniques [5,27]. For NOMA, research is progressing from theoretical studies towards engineering implementation and prototype development, including multi-carrier NOMA prototypes for scenarios like the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) [1]. Low-complexity NOMA schemes are being designed based on complexity-constrained theory models [27]. For instance, a reliability-based expectation propagation (REP) algorithm has been proposed to reduce the complexity of the EP receiver by approximately $3 5 \%$ with acceptable performance loss [27]. In the context of URAT, future work focuses on optimizing time-frequency resource allocation to reduce resource requirements while meeting latency constraints, and on optimizing preamble sequence design, pilot scheme design, and multi-user detection schemes [5]. For large-scale MIMO-ISAC, the hybrid analog-digital structure is an effective solution to reduce RF chains and manage energy consumption, although designing hybrid beamforming under hardware constraints remains key [23]. Energy-saving technologies and virtualization are crucial for minimizing energy consumption in Cell-Free systems [42]. Efficient design principles are being investigated for extra-large scale MIMO to address cost, overhead, and complexity [11]. Prototype efforts for multi-antenna, cooperative communication, and multi-point coordinated communication for NOMA represent future work directions aimed at practical implementation [1].​  

In summary, while advanced MA techniques offer significant potential for 6G, their deployment is contingent upon overcoming substantial computational complexity, ensuring robust CSI acquisition and synchronization, and developing hardware-efficient and energy-conscious designs. Addressing these implementation challenges is critical for realizing the full capabilities of these techniques in future wireless networks.​

The evolution towards intelligent 6G networks, characterized by ubiquitous massive connections and the integration of cyber-physical systems, introduces significant challenges and demands on security and privacy [1,34]. Future 6G networks must ensure high levels of trust, reliability, and resilience, particularly in connecting humans and intelligent machines, which necessitates robust security capabilities [34]. Security awareness and resilience are crucial at both deployment and operational levels, alongside respecting user privacy and data ownership [34]. Traditional security approaches, often based on “patching” existing vulnerabilities, may be insufficient to counter the pervasive attacks and uncertain risks anticipated in 6G; therefore, security mechanisms must be intrinsically integrated into network protocols and architecture design from the outset to ensure identity authenticity, control security, communication reliability, and data credibility [35]. Furthermore, new network architectures like non-terrestrial networks introduce novel vulnerabilities that require protection against digital threats [37]. Technologies like blockchain, due to their distributed storage and credibility, are being explored for enhanced security and trust in specific areas, such as achieving flexible and efficient dynamic spectrum sharing [14] and potentially supporting autonomous trading capabilities for intelligent terminals via virtual currencies [2].​  

Advanced multiple access techniques, particularly non-orthogonal schemes like NOMA, while enhancing spectral efficiency and connectivity, also introduce inherent security vulnerabilities. The core principle of NOMA involves superimposing signals from multiple users, which increases the risk of eavesdropping by authorized users sharing the same spectrum resources [1]. A key vulnerability arises if Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), used by receivers to decode signals, is not perfectly executed or if the decoding order is compromised, potentially allowing unintended users to gain access to information meant for others [39]. Even advanced techniques like massive MIMO, which can enhance physical layer security (PLS) against passive eavesdroppers, remain susceptible to countermeasures employed by smart eavesdroppers [40]. To mitigate these risks in NOMA networks, research focuses on security enhancement techniques such as optimizing precoding schemes, adjusting SIC sequences, and employing full-duplex relays to improve overall security and protect user information [39]. In schemes like URAT, feedback information containing terminal identity or related details is broadcast or groupcast, indicating successful reception, which implies a reliance on secure feedback mechanisms to prevent potential information leakage or manipulation [5].​  

Privacy concerns are particularly prominent in data-intensive applications leveraging 6G capabilities, such as Federated Learning (FL). FL provides significant support for applications prioritizing data privacy by enabling training across multiple user devices without requiring the direct transmission of private data [38]. Instead of uploading original data, user devices upload model parameters, which inherently reduces communication burdens and enhances data privacy protection [26]. Multiple access techniques play a crucial role in enabling and supporting this privacy-preserving paradigm. For instance, combining multiple access technology with ground codebooks can address both data privacy and communication efficiency challenges in large-scale IoT FL systems [3]. In this approach, multiple access codebooks are assigned to clients to manage their participation, allowing model training to occur locally and thereby safeguarding user privacy [3]. Simultaneously, collision monitoring of these codebooks by the server aids in processing data collisions and improving the accuracy of the global model, demonstrating how specific multiple access designs can enhance the security and efficiency of FL systems [3]. Thus, the integration of appropriate multiple access techniques is essential not only for connectivity but also for underpinning the privacy-preserving capabilities of future 6G applications like FL.​  

# 13. Future Trends and Open Research Challenges  

Despite significant progress in developing multiple access techniques for 6G networks, several formidable challenges remain that must be addressed to fully realize their potential [10,36,39]. Key challenges include managing increased system complexity, navigating performance trade-offs inherent in integrating diverse services, ensuring scalability to accommodate massive numbers of devices, and achieving seamless integration across heterogeneous network components [36].  

Specific technical challenges are apparent in various domains. For grant-free massive access (GFMA), key challenges and open issues require further investigation to delineate future research directions [16]. In Unique Random Access (URAT) technology, a notable challenge lies in optimizing time-frequency resources, as current implementations often utilize very low code rate coding that demands high time-frequency resource consumption [4,5]. Future work is needed to reduce frequency domain resources while preserving delay requirements, and to enhance preamble sequence design, pilot scheme design, and multi-user detection schemes within the URAT framework [4,5]. For Massive MIMO, particularly in conjunction with Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS), low overhead downlink channel estimation remains an open problem [40]. When extending Massive MIMO to space-based networks or extra-large scale MIMO (U6G), challenges include spectrum resource management, interference suppression in complex scenarios, and mitigating large propagation distances and delays [42]. Designing flexible and scalable network architectures is crucial for satellite-terrestrial integrated networks, considering varied transmission conditions, delays, and dynamic link switching [20]. Achieving efficient wireless communication while simultaneously ensuring privacy protection is also highlighted as a critical issue [38].  

![](images/0608fe3027e8ecb2f5a6fe17ab3421f85186ffe243abe08cb1685b2174d8fbcd.jpg)  

Looking ahead, promising future research directions are emerging across multiple fronts. The development of fundamentally new multiple access paradigms is anticipated, including novel access technologies specifically tailored for machine type communication (MTC), uplink-dominated systems, and decentralized network structures [15]. Advancements in waveforms, coding/modulation designs, and multiple access technologies are expected to be central to 6G deployment [7]. Further research is also needed in UMA coding design to improve performance and efficiency [25].  

AI-driven optimization and AI-Native design are pivotal for the evolution towards intelligent and simplified (intellicise) wireless networks [9,35]. Integrating AI and communication technologies is seen as essential for 6G and beyond [36]. AI, machine learning, deep learning, edge computing, and distributed/federated learning are identified as key enablers to overcome challenges in advanced network scenarios, such as space-enabled networks [42]. The integration of federated learning with multiple access codebook technology demonstrates feasibility for improving training speed and protecting user privacy in large-scale IoT, offering a new pathway for efficient and secure communication [3,26]. Future advancements should leverage intelligent communication algorithms and efficient access mechanisms for more efficient and secure data processing [26]. Ultra-low power AI is also highlighted as a key area for 6G development [34].​  

Exploration of new spectrum bands, including Terahertz (THz) and visible light (as part of Optical Wireless or OW), is crucial to meet increasing capacity demands [7]. Research into Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), particularly ISAC-OW technology, is expected to provide advanced core solutions for demanding 6G scenarios [24]. Semantic communication is another key technology that will bring new opportunities and challenges to spectrum management and pricing mechanisms [2]. Efficient multi-RAT spectrum sharing between 6G and 5G is vital for optimizing the use of limited low- and mid-band spectrum [34].​  

Research into energy-efficient and sustainable MA schemes is imperative, given stricter energy constraints [9]. This includes developing ultra-low power AI, dynamic sleep and wake capabilities for network elements, and features like wake-up signals and dynamic bandwidth adaptation to extend device battery life [34]. 6G's sustainability goals will drive social impact [37].​  

Designing inherently secure and privacy-preserving protocols is a hot research area, particularly physical layer security and covert communication in NOMA networks [1,19]. Achieving both strong transmission security and concealment by hiding wireless transmission behavior is a key objective [1]. Combining NOMA with physical layer security technologies addresses future IoT requirements for secure transmission [19]. The integration of federated learning into access schemes provides a concrete example of enhancing privacy [3,38].  

Other significant future directions include the organic combination of communication-perception integration (ISAC) with other 6G physical layer technologies [23]. The integration of RIS and Holographic MIMO with ISAC is a promising path, leveraging their advantages for enhanced perception coverage, robustness, and accuracy [23]. The evolution of large-scale MIMO to ultra-large-scale MIMO (U6G) is expected to further boost ISAC performance, providing higher spatial resolution and stronger beam adjustment capabilities for diverse applications, including low-altitude target monitoring and reliable location services in complex environments [23]. The combination of NOMA with mobile antennas is also explored to improve channel conditions, user decoding accuracy, and reduce outage probability, potentially increasing the number of users served under the same beam [1,19]. The vision of smart 6G encompasses the integrated networking of "air, space, earth, and sea" (ASGO-IN), along with high synergy of computing, control, communication, and cognition (4C) resources and deep integration with AI [2,35]. Satellite-assisted systems, such as CF-mMIMO-ISAC, show promise for improving performance compared to ground-only systems, especially in areas with limited ground infrastructure [8].  

Finally, the successful deployment of these advanced techniques necessitates concerted efforts towards standardization to ensure interoperability and widespread adoption [7,36,37]. Standardization efforts are currently in early stages, driven by ongoing research, prototyping, and simulations [37]. Actively exploring the technical capabilities and business models of new technologies during the 5G-Advanced stage will help pave the way for 6G [36]. Furthermore, experimental validation and testbed development are critical to bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and practical implementation, demonstrating the feasibility and performance of proposed multiple access solutions in realistic environments.​

A principal finding is the identification of several promising techniques tailored to diverse 6G scenarios and their potential to fulfill stringent key performance indicators (KPIs) [19]. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is consistently highlighted as a core technology for 6G, offering robust support by enhancing connection capacity and mitigating wireless channel effects, thereby satisfying the dual demands for capacity and performance [1,19,28]. NOMA is specifically recognized for its ability to address requirements for low latency, high reliability, massive connectivity, improved fairness, and high throughput in 6G systems [12,27].​  

Another significant technology explored is Ultra-Reliable Access Technology (URAT), particularly for 6G ultra-massive connectivity scenarios [4,5]. Simulation results demonstrate URAT's capability to achieve connection densities of $1 0 ^ { 6 }$ to $1 0 ^ { 8 }$ devices $\mathsf { \mathsf { k m } } ^ { 2 }$ and latencies below $1 0 \mathsf { m s }$ , effectively meeting stringent 6G requirements [4,5]. Its method of integrating random access and data transmission is key to reducing control plane delay [4].​  

Grant-Free Massive Access (GFMA) paradigms, especially those based on compressive sensing, are discussed for their relevance in addressing the requirements and enabling the vision of intelligent 6G networks [15,16]. UMA is also identified as a promising candidate for 6G massive Machine Type Communication (MTC) networks, offering a balance between transmission reliability and energy efficiency [25].​  

Furthermore, Massive MIMO, particularly in cell-free (CF-mMIMO) configurations, stands out as a key technology for 6G, promising increased capacity, reduced latency, and enhanced support for a greater number of users, thereby fostering the development of intelligent societies and the Internet of Things (IoT) [29]. Massive MIMO is also central to the concept of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), extending capabilities beyond communication to include sensing [23,42]. ISAC-OW, leveraging the optical spectrum, is highlighted as providing a strong technical foundation for integrated communication, positioning, and sensing in 6G applications [24]. Satellite–ground CF-mMIMO–ISAC schemes have shown potential to further improve average downlink user rates, particularly beneficial in scenarios with sparse ground infrastructure [8]. Resource hopping multiple access has been investigated for its application in federated learning within 6G massive IoT, aiming to optimize communication efficiency and data privacy [3].  

Despite these advancements, the realization of 6G's potential is contingent upon addressing significant challenges and unresolved research questions. Integrating NOMA into millimeter-wave communications presents specific challenges related to beamforming, power allocation, user pairing, and hybrid SDMA–NOMA systems [17]. For GFMA, main challenges and open research questions persist in CS-based approaches [16]. Further research is required for URAT, focusing on time– frequency resource optimization, preamble sequence design, pilot schemes, and multi-user detection to enhance its efficiency and performance [5]. Similarly, challenges in UMA coding design need further investigation [25]. The efficient implementation of Ultra-large Scale MIMO technology requires addressing significant cost, overhead, and complexity challenges [11]. Spectrum management remains critical; securing new spectrum and optimizing existing bands are paramount [7]. While primary spectrum markets utilize auction mechanisms, the secondary market for spectrum pricing is still in its nascent stage, lacking consensus and practical deployment [2]. Artificial intelligence methods are anticipated to offer effective solutions for 6G spectrum allocation and pricing [2], and the integration of blockchain and hybrid cloud technologies is proposed for efficient IoT spectrum sharing [14]. Security enhancements, including precoding optimization and RSMA-based frameworks, are necessary for secure NOMA transmission [39]. Future research directions for large-scale MIMO–ISAC include ultra-large-scale MIMO, cell-free large-scale MIMO, smart surfaces, and terahertz technology [23]. For 6Goriented satellite–terrestrial integrated networks, mobility management, resource management, and air interface protocol research are key areas [20]. General challenges related to power consumption, delay, and IC area in 6G networks also demand continued investigation [41].  

Multiple access techniques occupy a critical role in the evolution of wireless communication and are indispensable for enabling the intelligent and connected world envisioned by 6G [14,36]. The 6G vision entails constructing a more comprehensive and immersive communication architecture, capable of flexibly adapting to diverse network demands while reducing costs and service times, promising unprecedented performance, reliability, and security [37]. This future network aims to transform interactions across the human, physical, and digital realms [41], delivering substantially faster speeds and a wider range of solutions than 5G [34]. Core enablers include new spectrum utilization, integration of AI/ML, digital twins, and novel network topologies [37]. The success of smart 6G relies on high synergy across air, space, earth, and sea communication, coupled with tight integration of communication, computing, storage, and control, deep AI integration, and flexible programmability [35]. Novel access technologies are fundamental to developing future communication protocols that support emerging trends like MTC and decentralized networks [15]. The integration of grant-free random access with federated learning, for instance, exemplifies how future ICT can leverage advanced access methods to unlock the possibilities of the 6G era [38].​  

To fully unlock 6G's transformative potential, diligently addressing the identified challenges is paramount. Continued innovation in the design, optimization, and integration of multiple access techniques, supported by collaborative research efforts across diverse disciplines and stakeholders, is essential. Such concerted efforts will pave the way for navigating the complexities of the future wireless landscape and ensuring the realization of the robust, efficient, and intelligent connectivity required for tomorrow's interconnected world.​
