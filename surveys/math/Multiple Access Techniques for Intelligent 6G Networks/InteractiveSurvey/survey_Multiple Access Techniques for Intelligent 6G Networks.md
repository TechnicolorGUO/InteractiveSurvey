# 3 NOMA and RIS Optimization

## 3.1 Analytical and Simulation Methods for Performance Evaluation

### 3.1.1 Asymptotic Statistics and Capacity Gains in MIMO-MAC-RIS Systems
In the realm of MIMO-MAC-RIS systems, the integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) has emerged as a promising technique to enhance the spectral efficiency and capacity of wireless communication networks [3]. By leveraging the asymptotic statistics of large-scale systems, recent studies have derived closed-form expressions for the sum mutual information (MI) performance, which is a key metric for assessing the system's capacity. These expressions are particularly useful in understanding the behavior of the system as the number of antennas and RIS elements grows large, providing insights into the fundamental limits of such systems.

The asymptotic analysis of MIMO-MAC-RIS systems reveals that the sum-MI can be significantly enhanced through the optimal design of RIS phase matrices [4]. Specifically, the first two cumulant moments of the sum-MI, which capture the mean and variance of the distribution, are derived and used to characterize the capacity gains. These moments are functions of the system parameters, including the number of transmit and receive antennas, the number of RIS elements, and the channel statistics. By optimizing the phase matrices of the RISs, it is possible to maximize the sum-MI, thereby extending the capacity region of the MIMO-MAC-RIS system [4]. This optimization problem is typically formulated as a constrained optimization task, where the objective is to find the phase configurations that maximize the sum-MI while satisfying practical constraints such as power limits and phase shift resolution.

Moreover, the asymptotic analysis provides a framework for understanding the trade-offs between the number of RIS elements and the performance gains in MIMO-MAC-RIS systems [4]. For instance, the analysis shows that the capacity gains diminish as the number of RIS elements increases beyond a certain threshold, indicating that there is an optimal number of RIS elements that maximizes the system's performance. This insight is crucial for the practical deployment of RISs in real-world scenarios, as it helps in balancing the cost and complexity of the RIS setup with the expected performance improvements. Additionally, the asymptotic results are useful for evaluating the robustness of the system to channel estimation errors and other practical impairments, which are inevitable in real-world deployments.

### 3.1.2 Multi-Objective Optimization for Uplink Energy Efficiency
In the realm of 6G wireless communications, the integration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance uplink energy efficiency (EE). The primary challenge in this domain lies in balancing the trade-offs between maximizing EE and ensuring robustness against channel uncertainties and interference. To address these challenges, a multi-objective optimization framework has been developed, focusing on joint beamforming and power allocation strategies. This framework aims to optimize the uplink EE by leveraging the unique properties of RIS, such as its ability to manipulate the wireless environment without additional power consumption, thereby enhancing the overall system performance.

The optimization problem is typically formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is inherently non-convex and computationally complex. To tackle this complexity, a two-step suboptimal algorithm is often employed. In the first step, the beamforming vectors are optimized to enhance the channel gains for the far-user (FU), which is critical for improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reducing the required transmit power. This step leverages the RIS to create constructive interference patterns that favor the FU while mitigating interference for the near-user (NU). In the second step, the power allocation is optimized to further enhance the EE, taking into account the individual power constraints of each user. This step ensures that the power distribution is efficient and fair, thereby maximizing the overall system EE.

Simulation results have consistently shown that RIS-assisted NOMA systems outperform traditional NOMA and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) systems in terms of uplink EE [8]. The key advantage of this approach lies in its ability to dynamically adapt to varying channel conditions and user requirements, making it highly suitable for dense and dynamic 6G networks. Furthermore, the integration of RIS with NOMA not only improves EE but also enhances spectral efficiency (SE) and system capacity, making it a versatile solution for future wireless communications [7]. The joint optimization of beamforming and power allocation in RIS-assisted NOMA systems represents a significant advancement in the pursuit of energy-efficient and high-performance wireless networks [7].

### 3.1.3 GPU-Accelerated Neural Networks for NOMA Systems
In the realm of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems, the integration of graphics processing units (GPUs) for accelerating neural network (NN) computations has emerged as a promising approach to enhance system performance [9]. Traditional NOMA systems often rely on computationally intensive signal processing tasks, such as successive interference cancellation (SIC) and channel estimation, which can be significantly accelerated using the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs [5]. By leveraging the parallel architecture of GPUs, these systems can achieve substantial reductions in execution time, making them more suitable for real-time applications in dynamic and high-density environments.

The application of GPU-accelerated NNs in NOMA systems is particularly beneficial for tasks that require high computational power, such as optimizing resource allocation, power control, and user scheduling. For instance, in massive machine-type communication (mMTC) scenarios, where a large number of devices need to be efficiently managed, GPU-accelerated NNs can rapidly process the vast amounts of data generated by these devices, leading to improved system throughput and reduced latency. Moreover, the use of GPUs enables the implementation of more complex and sophisticated algorithms, such as deep learning models, which can adapt to varying channel conditions and user demands, thereby enhancing the overall robustness and efficiency of the NOMA system.

To further illustrate the effectiveness of GPU-accelerated NNs in NOMA systems, several experimental studies have been conducted using real-world data sets. These studies have demonstrated that GPU-based implementations can achieve significant performance gains over traditional CPU-based approaches, particularly in terms of execution time and computational efficiency [9]. For example, in a lab environment, a GPU-accelerated NN was shown to reduce the execution time of a NOMA system's signal processing tasks by up to 70%, while maintaining or even improving the system's performance metrics such as bit error rate (BER) and spectral efficiency [9]. This highlights the potential of GPU-accelerated NNs to revolutionize the design and operation of future 5G and 6G NOMA systems.

## 3.2 Comprehensive Reviews and Comparative Analyses

### 3.2.1 State-of-the-Art Techniques and Open Challenges in NOMA
Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has emerged as a key technique to address the increasing demands for higher spectral efficiency and massive connectivity in 5G and beyond networks [8]. By allowing multiple users to share the same time-frequency resource block through power-domain multiplexing, NOMA significantly enhances the system capacity and fairness compared to traditional Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) schemes [6]. The state-of-the-art techniques in NOMA include advanced signal processing methods such as superposition coding and successive interference cancellation (SIC), which enable the separation of overlapping signals at the receiver [6]. These techniques have been extensively studied in various contexts, including massive MIMO systems, where NOMA can leverage the spatial diversity to further improve performance.

Despite the advancements, several open challenges remain in the practical implementation of NOMA [10]. One of the primary challenges is the accurate and timely acquisition of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, which is crucial for effective power allocation and interference management. Imperfect CSI can lead to suboptimal performance, increased error rates, and reduced system reliability. Another challenge is the complexity and computational overhead associated with SIC, particularly in dense networks with a large number of users. Efficient algorithms and hardware designs are needed to reduce the latency and power consumption of SIC processes. Additionally, the integration of NOMA with other emerging technologies, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and backscatter communication, introduces new layers of complexity and requires innovative solutions to optimize the overall system performance.

Furthermore, the security and privacy of NOMA systems are critical concerns, especially in scenarios involving sensitive data and mission-critical applications [10]. The unique structure of NOMA, where multiple users' signals are superimposed, makes it vulnerable to various attacks, including eavesdropping and jamming [5]. Developing robust security mechanisms that can protect against these threats while maintaining the efficiency and flexibility of NOMA is an important area of ongoing research [10]. Lastly, the standardization and interoperability of NOMA with existing communication protocols and infrastructure pose significant hurdles that need to be addressed to facilitate widespread adoption and deployment of NOMA in future networks [6].

### 3.2.2 Integration of Caching Techniques with NOMA
The integration of caching techniques with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the efficiency and performance of future wireless networks [6]. By leveraging the superposition coding and successive interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities of NOMA, caching can be strategically deployed to pre-fetch and store popular content at the edge of the network, thereby reducing the load on the core network and improving user experience. This integration not only alleviates the pressure on backhaul links but also reduces latency and enhances the overall spectral efficiency of the system. The key idea is to utilize the NOMA framework to enable multiple users to access cached content simultaneously, even when they are located in different regions with varying channel conditions.

In the context of NOMA, caching can be implemented at various network layers, including base stations (BSs), relay nodes, and user devices [6]. At the BS level, caching can be used to store frequently requested content, which can then be delivered to multiple users using NOMA techniques. This approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios where users have similar content preferences, as it allows for efficient content delivery through power-domain multiplexing. For relay nodes, caching can be integrated to extend the coverage and capacity of the network, especially in areas with poor channel conditions. User devices can also cache content, enabling direct device-to-device (D2D) communication and reducing the need for frequent interactions with the BS. This decentralized caching strategy can further enhance the robustness and scalability of the network.

The integration of caching with NOMA also introduces new challenges, such as optimizing the placement and delivery of cached content, managing interference, and ensuring fairness among users [6]. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed various optimization algorithms and strategies. For instance, content placement algorithms can be designed to maximize the hit rate of cached content while minimizing the overall network load. Additionally, power allocation schemes can be developed to balance the trade-off between user fairness and system throughput. Furthermore, the integration of machine learning techniques can enable dynamic and adaptive caching and NOMA strategies, thereby improving the overall performance and efficiency of the network.

### 3.2.3 Security and Performance Enhancements in NOMA Systems
Security and performance enhancements in Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) systems are critical for the deployment of reliable and efficient next-generation wireless networks [6]. In the context of RIS-aided NOMA networks, recent studies have focused on integrating physical layer security (PLS) mechanisms to mitigate eavesdropping threats [7]. These threats can arise from both internal and external sources, necessitating robust beamforming and power allocation schemes. By optimizing these parameters, the system can effectively minimize the information leakage to potential eavesdroppers while maintaining high data rates for legitimate users. For instance, the use of intelligent reflecting surfaces (RISs) can dynamically adjust the propagation environment to create favorable conditions for secure communication, enhancing the overall security posture of the network.

The performance of NOMA systems is also significantly influenced by the Bit Error Rate (BER) and the downlink transmit power [6]. Research has shown that RIS-assisted NOMA systems can achieve better BER performance compared to traditional OMA systems, both with and without RISs [7]. This improvement is attributed to the ability of RISs to focus the signal energy towards intended users, thereby reducing interference and improving the quality of the received signal. Additionally, the downlink transmit power minimization problem in RIS-empowered NOMA networks has been addressed, leading to more energy-efficient communication [8]. By carefully designing the transmit power levels and optimizing the RIS phase shifts, the system can achieve a balance between energy consumption and performance, making it suitable for battery-constrained devices in massive machine-type communication (mMTC) scenarios.

Furthermore, the integration of NOMA with other advanced technologies, such as backscatter communication and cooperative communication, has been explored to enhance the overall system performance [1]. For example, in cooperative NOMA systems, the sum rate can be maximized, and fairness among users can be achieved through optimized power allocation and scheduling algorithms [8]. These advancements not only improve the spectral efficiency and reliability of the network but also pave the way for innovative applications in IoT, vehicular networks, and other emerging domains. The synergy between these technologies and NOMA holds the promise of addressing the stringent requirements of future 6G networks, including ultra-low latency, high reliability, and massive connectivity [11].

## 3.3 Optimization for Fairness and Efficiency

### 3.3.1 Maximizing Data Rates and Ensuring Fairness in Downlink LIS-NOMA
In the realm of downlink LIS-NOMA systems, maximizing data rates while ensuring fairness among users is a critical challenge [10]. The integration of Large Intelligent Surfaces (LIS) with Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) leverages the spatial reconfigurability of LIS to enhance the system's coverage and data rates, particularly in environments with obstructed line-of-sight (LOS) paths. By dynamically adjusting the phase shifts of the LIS elements, the system can create constructive interference for desired users and destructive interference for others, effectively improving the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and thus the data rates. However, this enhancement must be balanced with the need for fair resource allocation among users to prevent dominant users from monopolizing the channel resources.

To address this challenge, recent studies have focused on developing sophisticated optimization algorithms that jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS) and the phase shift coefficients at the LIS. These algorithms aim to maximize the sum rate of the system while ensuring that each user meets a minimum rate requirement, thereby promoting fairness. Techniques such as successive convex approximation (SCA) and alternating optimization have been employed to solve the non-convex optimization problems inherent in this setup. Additionally, the use of machine learning (ML) approaches, particularly deep reinforcement learning (DRL), has been explored to adaptively adjust the system parameters in real-time, further enhancing both data rates and fairness.

Furthermore, the deployment of LIS in NOMA systems introduces new degrees of freedom that can be exploited to manage multi-user interference more effectively [5]. By carefully designing the LIS phase shifts, the system can prioritize users based on their channel conditions and quality of service (QoS) requirements, ensuring that users with poorer channel conditions or higher priority are served more efficiently. This adaptive approach not only maximizes the overall system throughput but also ensures that the system remains robust to variations in the wireless environment, making it a promising solution for future 6G networks [2].

### 3.3.2 Joint Beamforming and Power Allocation for Physical Layer Security
In the context of physical layer security (PLS) for wireless communication systems, particularly those employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), joint beamforming and power allocation (BF-PA) strategies play a crucial role in enhancing security against internal eavesdropping [7]. The primary objective is to optimize the system's secrecy rate while minimizing the information leakage to potential eavesdroppers [7]. This is achieved by carefully designing the beamforming vectors and power allocation schemes to ensure that the legitimate users' channels are strengthened, while the eavesdroppers' channels are weakened or nullified.

The optimization problem is typically formulated as a non-convex problem, which is computationally challenging to solve. To address this, a suboptimal algorithm is proposed, consisting of two main steps. In the first step, the beamforming vectors are optimized to enhance the channel gains for the friendly users (FUs) while simultaneously degrading the channel conditions for the eavesdroppers. This is achieved by leveraging the spatial degrees of freedom provided by multiple antennas at the base station (BS) and the RIS. The second step involves optimizing the power allocation among the users to further improve the secrecy rate [7]. This step takes into account the channel conditions and the power constraints to ensure that the power is allocated in a manner that maximizes the secrecy rate while maintaining the quality of service (QoS) for the legitimate users.

To solve the BF-PA problem, various techniques such as alternating optimization, Lagrange duality, and convex relaxation are employed. The alternating optimization approach iteratively optimizes the beamforming vectors and power allocation, leading to a near-optimal solution. The Lagrange duality method is used to transform the non-convex problem into a series of convex subproblems, which can be solved efficiently. The performance of the proposed BF-PA scheme is evaluated through simulations, demonstrating significant improvements in the secrecy rate and robustness against eavesdropping, especially in scenarios where the eavesdroppers have superior channel conditions compared to the legitimate users.

### 3.3.3 Computation Energy Efficiency Maximization in NOMA Systems
Computation energy efficiency (CEE) maximization in NOMA systems is a critical aspect of enhancing the overall performance and sustainability of next-generation wireless networks [8]. In NOMA systems, the primary challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between maximizing the data rate and minimizing the energy consumption, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as massive machine-type communication (mMTC) and Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios [10]. To address this, researchers have proposed various optimization frameworks that integrate user pairing, power allocation, and beamforming techniques [12]. These frameworks aim to jointly optimize the system parameters to achieve the highest possible CEE while maintaining the required quality of service (QoS).

One prominent approach involves formulating the CEE maximization problem as a non-convex optimization problem, which is typically solved using iterative algorithms or heuristic methods. For instance, the user pairing stage is crucial, as it determines which users can effectively share the same resource block while minimizing interference. This is often achieved by considering factors such as channel conditions, user distances, and power constraints. Subsequently, the power allocation stage involves determining the optimal transmit power levels for each user to maximize the CEE, taking into account the impact of successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receivers. Additionally, beamforming techniques are employed to focus the transmitted energy towards the intended users, thereby reducing the overall energy consumption and improving the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR).

To further enhance the CEE, recent studies have explored the integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and other advanced technologies. RISs can dynamically adjust the phase shifts of the reflected signals, enabling more precise control over the propagation environment and thus improving the energy efficiency of NOMA systems. Moreover, the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms has been proposed to predict user behavior and channel conditions, allowing for more adaptive and efficient resource management. These advancements not only contribute to higher CEE but also pave the way for more sustainable and resilient wireless communication systems in the future.

### 4.1.1 Global and Ubiquitous 6G Communication Systems
Global and ubiquitous 6G communication systems are envisioned to seamlessly integrate terrestrial, aerial, and space-based networks, creating a truly interconnected global communication fabric. This integration will enable the support of ultra-high data rates, exceedingly low latency, and massive connectivity, essential for the realization of advanced applications such as the Metaverse, holographic telepresence, and real-time autonomous systems. The architecture of 6G systems will be characterized by a highly dynamic and intelligent network that can adapt to varying environmental conditions and user demands, ensuring ubiquitous connectivity across diverse geographical and operational contexts [13].

To achieve these ambitious goals, 6G systems will leverage a broad spectrum of technologies, including sub-terahertz and terahertz (THz) bands, visible light communication (VLC), and advanced modulation techniques [13]. The utilization of these higher frequency bands will not only provide the necessary bandwidth for ultra-high data rates but also introduce new challenges related to propagation and interference management. Additionally, the deployment of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) and heterogeneous radios will play a crucial role in enhancing coverage and capacity, particularly in challenging environments where traditional infrastructure may be insufficient.

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into 6G networks will be pivotal for optimizing network performance and resource allocation [13]. These technologies will enable the network to dynamically adjust to changing conditions, predict user behavior, and autonomously manage complex network operations. Furthermore, the concept of network slicing will be extended in 6G, allowing for the creation of multiple virtual networks tailored to specific applications and services, thereby ensuring high-quality service delivery and enhanced user experience in a globally connected environment.

### 4.1.2 High-Throughput Satellite Systems and Their Evolution
High-throughput satellite (HTS) systems represent a significant advancement in satellite communications, driven by the increasing demand for broadband services and the need to support emerging applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). These systems are characterized by their ability to deliver significantly higher data rates and lower latencies compared to traditional satellite systems. The evolution of HTS has been marked by the adoption of advanced technologies such as multi-beam antennas, frequency reuse, and digital payload processing, which collectively enhance spectral efficiency and capacity. Multi-beam antennas allow satellites to focus beams on specific geographic areas, thereby increasing the data throughput and reducing interference between adjacent beams. Frequency reuse further maximizes the utilization of available spectrum by allowing different beams to operate on the same frequencies without causing significant interference.

The integration of HTS with terrestrial networks is another critical aspect of their evolution, particularly in the context of 5G and beyond. This integration enables seamless connectivity and handover between satellite and terrestrial networks, addressing the limitations of terrestrial infrastructure in remote and underserved regions. The use of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) in HTS systems facilitates dynamic resource allocation and network optimization, enhancing the overall performance and flexibility of these systems. Additionally, the deployment of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has introduced new possibilities for global coverage and reduced latency, making HTS a key component in the realization of a truly global, interconnected network.

Looking ahead, the continued evolution of HTS is expected to be driven by advancements in antenna technology, signal processing, and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms. These technologies will play a crucial role in optimizing network performance, managing complex traffic patterns, and ensuring robust and reliable communication links. The development of hybrid satellite-terrestrial systems, combining the strengths of both domains, will be essential in meeting the diverse and demanding requirements of future communication networks, including those for 6G. Furthermore, the exploration of higher frequency bands, such as the terahertz (THz) band, will be crucial for achieving the ultra-high data rates and low latencies required for next-generation applications [12].

### 4.1.3 Integration of RIS-Aided CF mMIMO with Emerging Technologies
The integration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided Cell-Free Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (CF mMIMO) with emerging technologies is pivotal for achieving the stringent Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of 6G networks [14]. This integration leverages the unique properties of RIS, such as its ability to manipulate electromagnetic waves with minimal power consumption, to enhance the coverage, capacity, and energy efficiency of CF mMIMO systems. By dynamically adjusting the phase shifts of the RIS elements, the system can optimize signal propagation, mitigate interference, and improve link reliability, thereby supporting a wide range of 6G use cases, including augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and high-precision manufacturing.

One of the key challenges in integrating RIS-aided CF mMIMO with emerging technologies is the seamless coordination between the RIS, base stations, and user equipment (UE). This requires advanced control algorithms and protocols to ensure efficient resource allocation and dynamic reconfiguration of the RIS elements. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) play a crucial role in this context by enabling predictive modeling and real-time optimization of the network. For instance, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can be employed to adaptively control the RIS phase shifts based on the current network conditions and user demands, thus maximizing the overall system performance.

Furthermore, the integration of RIS-aided CF mMIMO with other 6G technologies, such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications, and mobile edge computing (MEC), presents additional opportunities and challenges [15]. NOMA can enhance spectral efficiency by allowing multiple UEs to share the same time-frequency resources, while mmWave communications can provide the high bandwidth required for data-intensive applications [10]. MEC, on the other hand, can offload computationally intensive tasks from UEs to the network edge, reducing latency and improving user experience [16]. The synergy between these technologies and RIS-aided CF mMIMO is essential for realizing the full potential of 6G networks, particularly in dense urban environments where high data rates and low latency are critical [15].

## 4.2 System Architectures and Key Enabling Technologies

### 4.2.1 Requirements and Enabling Technologies for 6G Networks
The requirements for 6G networks are driven by the need to support a wide array of advanced applications, including ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), massive machine-type communications (mMTC), and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) with significantly higher performance metrics than those of 5G [13]. To achieve these goals, 6G networks must support data rates exceeding 1 Tbps, end-to-end latencies below 1 ms, and connection densities of up to 10 million devices per square kilometer [13]. Additionally, 6G networks are expected to provide seamless integration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks, enabling global coverage and connectivity in remote and underdeveloped areas.

To meet these stringent requirements, several enabling technologies are being explored for 6G networks [13]. Terahertz (THz) communications, which operate in the frequency range of 0.1 to 10 THz, are a key technology due to their ability to support ultra-high data rates and low latency [12]. However, THz communications face significant challenges, such as severe path loss and limited penetration through obstacles, which necessitate the development of advanced signal processing techniques and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) to enhance signal propagation. Another critical technology is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the network architecture, enabling dynamic resource allocation, predictive maintenance, and autonomous network management.

Furthermore, 6G networks will leverage the concept of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to improve coverage and capacity by dynamically manipulating electromagnetic waves. RIS technology can be used to mitigate interference, enhance signal strength, and reduce energy consumption, making it a promising solution for network densification. Additionally, the integration of quantum communication technologies is being considered to provide unparalleled security and privacy, addressing the growing concerns over data breaches and cyber threats. These technologies, combined with advancements in edge computing and network slicing, will form the foundation of the 6G network architecture, enabling the realization of a truly intelligent and connected world [2].

### 4.2.2 Non-Coherent and Backscatter Communication Techniques
Non-coherent and backscatter communication techniques represent a significant shift from traditional communication paradigms, particularly in the context of 6G networks [3]. Non-coherent communications eliminate the need for complex and power-hungry synchronization and channel estimation processes, which are essential in coherent systems. By leveraging simpler modulation schemes such as differential phase shift keying (DPSK) or frequency shift keying (FSK), non-coherent systems reduce the computational overhead and power consumption, making them highly suitable for low-power, low-cost devices. This simplicity is particularly advantageous in massive Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, where a vast number of devices with limited energy resources must communicate efficiently and reliably.

Backscatter communications, on the other hand, enable devices to communicate by reflecting or backscattering ambient radio frequency (RF) signals, thereby eliminating the need for an active transmitter [1]. This technique is particularly effective in scenarios where energy harvesting is a critical requirement, such as in remote or inaccessible locations. Backscatter communication can be further enhanced by incorporating intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), which can dynamically adjust the phase and amplitude of the reflected signals to optimize communication performance. These surfaces can significantly improve the range and reliability of backscatter communications, making them a promising solution for both indoor and outdoor applications.

In the context of 6G, the integration of non-coherent and backscatter communication techniques is expected to play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of network densification, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness [3]. The joint application of these techniques can enable the deployment of ultra-dense networks with minimal infrastructure, thereby facilitating the connection of trillions of devices across various domains, including terrestrial, aerial, space, and sea. However, several open research challenges remain, including the optimization of resource allocation, the development of robust channel models for non-coherent and backscatter communications, and the integration of these techniques with advanced signal processing algorithms to enhance system performance and reliability. Future research should also focus on the practical implementation of these techniques in real-world scenarios, considering factors such as environmental interference, mobility, and security.

### 4.2.3 6G Mobile-Edge Empowered Metaverse
The integration of 6G mobile-edge computing (MEC) into the Metaverse represents a pivotal advancement in the realization of immersive, interactive, and highly personalized digital environments [16]. 6G MEC architectures are designed to address the stringent latency and bandwidth requirements of the Metaverse, which demands real-time processing and low-latency communication for seamless user experiences [16]. By deploying MEC nodes closer to the end-users, 6G networks can significantly reduce the round-trip time for data processing, thereby enhancing the responsiveness and interactivity of Metaverse applications such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR).

Moreover, 6G MEC is expected to play a crucial role in managing the computational and storage demands of the Metaverse. The distributed nature of MEC allows for the offloading of resource-intensive tasks from user devices to edge servers, which can process and render complex graphics and simulations more efficiently [12]. This not only extends the battery life of user devices but also ensures that the Metaverse can support a large number of concurrent users without compromising performance. Additionally, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) within 6G MEC frameworks will enable intelligent resource allocation and dynamic optimization of network resources, further enhancing the scalability and adaptability of the Metaverse.

However, the deployment of 6G MEC for the Metaverse also presents several challenges. These include the need for robust security and privacy mechanisms to protect user data, the development of efficient algorithms for task offloading and resource management, and the creation of standardized protocols for seamless interoperability between different MEC nodes and devices. Research efforts are currently focused on addressing these challenges through the development of advanced cryptographic techniques, novel offloading strategies, and the establishment of industry standards. As 6G networks evolve, the continued refinement of MEC technologies will be essential in realizing the full potential of the Metaverse, paving the way for a more connected and interactive digital future [16].

## 4.3 Advanced Technologies and AI Integration

### 4.3.1 AI for Intelligent Network Operation and Management
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize the operation and management of future communication networks, particularly in the context of 6G, by enabling a paradigm shift towards autonomous and intelligent network management [13]. The integration of AI into network operations facilitates the creation of a cognitive network that can dynamically adapt to changing conditions, optimize performance, and ensure high reliability and efficiency. AI-driven networks can perform a wide range of tasks, including real-time network environment sensing, predictive maintenance, proactive configuration, and dynamic optimization, thereby reducing the need for human intervention and improving overall network resilience.

The deployment of AI at the network edge is a critical component of this transformation, as it allows for the processing of large volumes of data in real-time and the execution of complex tasks closer to the user [13]. This edge-centric AI approach not only reduces latency and enhances the user experience but also enables the network to respond more effectively to localized conditions and user-specific requirements. Multi-level AI, which involves the coordination of AI capabilities across different layers of the network, from the edge to the cloud, is essential for achieving a seamless and efficient network operation [13]. This hierarchical AI structure supports the continuous learning and adaptation of the network, ensuring that it can evolve to meet the demands of emerging applications and services.

Moreover, AI is instrumental in addressing the challenges of network densification and the integration of multiple access technologies, which are key requirements for 6G networks [17]. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, AI can optimize the allocation of resources, manage the coexistence of different communication technologies, and ensure the seamless handover of connections. This intelligent management of network resources is crucial for supporting the high density of devices and the diverse range of services that are expected in future networks, ultimately leading to a more robust, efficient, and user-centric communication infrastructure.

### 4.3.2 Designing the REASON Architecture for 6G
Designing the REASON architecture for 6G involves addressing the multifaceted challenges of integrating advanced technologies while ensuring the architecture supports the stringent requirements of future applications [17]. The REASON architecture is designed to be inherently intelligent, highly dynamic, and extremely heterogeneous, capable of supporting data rates up to 1 Tbps with end-to-end latencies below 1 millisecond. This level of performance is crucial for enabling real-time, immersive experiences in applications such as holographic telepresence, e-Health, and smart city infrastructures. The architecture must also be resilient and secure, capable of adapting to dynamic network conditions and protecting against sophisticated cyber threats.

To achieve these goals, the REASON architecture leverages several key technologies and design principles [17]. For instance, it incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enable intelligent network management and optimization. AI-driven algorithms can dynamically allocate resources, predict traffic patterns, and optimize network performance in real-time. Additionally, the architecture supports the integration of diverse communication paradigms, including terahertz (THz) communications, non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). These technologies are essential for creating an ultradense and highly interconnected network that can support the vast number of devices and data volumes expected in 6G environments [13].

Furthermore, the REASON architecture emphasizes sustainability and interoperability. Sustainability is achieved through energy-efficient designs and the use of renewable energy sources, reducing the environmental impact of 6G networks [18]. Interoperability is ensured by adhering to open standards and protocols, allowing seamless integration with existing 5G and future networking technologies. This approach not only facilitates the transition from 5G to 6G but also promotes a collaborative ecosystem where various stakeholders can contribute to the development and deployment of innovative applications and services. By addressing these critical aspects, the REASON architecture aims to provide a robust foundation for the next generation of mobile networks, enabling a wide range of transformative applications and services.

### 4.3.3 Cognitive Tools and Task-Based Networking in 6G
Cognitive tools and task-based networking are pivotal in the evolution towards 6G, marking a significant departure from the traditional network paradigms [17]. In 6G, cognitive tools are designed to enable networks to dynamically adapt to changing environments and user demands, leveraging advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms [17]. These tools facilitate real-time decision-making, optimizing network performance and resource allocation. For instance, AI-driven cognitive engines can predict traffic patterns and proactively adjust network configurations to enhance user experience, reduce latency, and improve overall efficiency. This adaptability is crucial for supporting the ultrahigh data rates and ultra-low latencies required by 6G applications such as holographic telepresence and real-time autonomous systems [15].

Task-based networking, another key aspect of 6G, focuses on aligning network operations with specific tasks or applications, rather than providing a one-size-fits-all service [13]. This approach allows for more efficient and effective use of network resources by tailoring the network's behavior to the unique requirements of each task. For example, in a smart city environment, different tasks such as traffic management, public safety, and environmental monitoring may have distinct QoS requirements. Task-based networking can dynamically allocate resources to ensure that each task receives the necessary support, optimizing the network's performance and reliability. This paradigm shift is essential for supporting the diverse and complex use cases envisioned for 6G, including massive machine-type communications (mMTC) and enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) [3].

The integration of cognitive tools and task-based networking in 6G also addresses the challenge of network densification and heterogeneity [17]. As 6G networks become increasingly dense and heterogeneous, with a proliferation of devices and communication technologies, the complexity of managing these networks grows exponentially [3]. Cognitive tools can help manage this complexity by automating network management tasks, such as spectrum allocation, interference mitigation, and mobility management. Task-based networking, in turn, ensures that the network remains agile and responsive, capable of adapting to the dynamic and diverse demands of a wide range of applications. Together, these technologies will play a crucial role in realizing the full potential of 6G, enabling a seamless and intelligent communication experience for users and devices alike [3].

# 5 Theoretical and Simulation Studies for 6G

## 5.1 Deep Reinforcement Learning and Resource Management

### 5.1.1 PPO Algorithm for Virtual Reality Streaming with HRSMA
The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm has emerged as a powerful tool in reinforcement learning, particularly suited for complex and dynamic environments such as virtual reality (VR) streaming [19]. In the context of VR streaming with Hierarchical Resource Sharing and Multiplexing Architecture (HRSMA), PPO is utilized to optimize the allocation of resources and manage interference, ensuring high-quality user experiences. The algorithm operates by iteratively updating the policy parameters to maximize the expected reward, which in this case is defined by metrics such as video quality, latency, and network efficiency. By leveraging the actor-critic architecture, PPO balances exploration and exploitation, allowing it to adapt to varying network conditions and user demands.

In the specific application of VR streaming, PPO is tasked with dynamically adjusting the transmission rates and resource blocks allocated to different users, while also managing the interference between multiple access points (APs). This is achieved through a series of episodes, where the algorithm learns from the outcomes of its actions and refines its strategy over time. The hierarchical nature of HRSMA enables PPO to coordinate the activities of multiple APs, ensuring that the overall system performance is optimized. For instance, PPO can intelligently prioritize the transmission of high-priority data packets, such as those containing critical frames of a VR video, to minimize latency and ensure smooth playback.

Moreover, the integration of PPO with HRSMA introduces a robust mechanism for handling the inherent unpredictability of wireless environments. By continuously monitoring the network state and user feedback, PPO can adapt its policies to mitigate issues such as packet loss and jitter, which are common in VR streaming. This adaptive approach is crucial for maintaining high levels of user satisfaction, especially in scenarios where users are engaged in interactive VR applications that require real-time responsiveness. The combination of PPO and HRSMA thus represents a significant advancement in the field of VR streaming, offering a scalable and efficient solution for delivering immersive and reliable content in future 6G networks [19].

### 5.1.2 Federated Learning for Noise and Fading Mitigation
Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful tool for training machine learning models across multiple decentralized edge devices, enabling the aggregation of knowledge without the need for centralized data storage [20]. In the context of noise and fading mitigation, FL offers a unique advantage by allowing the collaborative training of models that can adapt to varying channel conditions. The Noise Resilient Over-the-Air Federated Learning (NoROTA-FL) framework specifically addresses the challenges posed by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and data heterogeneity in wireless environments. By formulating a robust constrained local optimization problem, NoROTA-FL ensures that the model updates transmitted over noisy channels are resilient to both noise and the inherent differences in data distributions across devices [20].

In NoROTA-FL, the key innovation lies in the use of Over-the-Air Computation (AirComp), which leverages the physical layer properties of the wireless channel to perform federated averaging directly over the air. This approach not only reduces the communication overhead but also enhances the robustness of the model updates against channel impairments. AirComp works by aligning the transmitted gradients in the complex plane, effectively summing them up at the receiver. This method is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the channel conditions are poor, as it can mitigate the effects of fading and noise through constructive interference. Moreover, the simultaneous transmission of gradients from multiple devices can exploit the diversity gains offered by the multi-user channel, further improving the reliability of the aggregated model.

The effectiveness of NoROTA-FL in mitigating noise and fading is further enhanced by incorporating advanced error correction techniques and adaptive modulation schemes. These techniques ensure that the quality of the aggregated model remains high even under severe channel conditions. Additionally, the framework supports dynamic adjustment of the training parameters based on real-time feedback from the channel, allowing for optimal performance in a wide range of environments. By combining these features, NoROTA-FL provides a comprehensive solution for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of federated learning in wireless networks, making it a promising approach for future communication systems.

### 5.1.3 Precoding Factor and Threshold-Based Strategy for Client Management
In the context of client management within cell-free (CF) massive MIMO systems, the introduction of a precoding factor is a critical technique aimed at mitigating the adverse effects of noise and channel fading. This precoding factor is dynamically adjusted based on the channel state information (CSI) available at the server, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each user equipment (UE). By optimizing the precoding factor, the system can effectively reduce the impact of noise, leading to improved spectral efficiency and data rates. The precoding factor is particularly useful in environments with high levels of noise and interference, where traditional precoding methods may fall short.

To further enhance the robustness of the system, a threshold-based strategy is employed to manage client participation in the communication process. This strategy involves setting a performance threshold, below which clients are temporarily or permanently excluded from the network. The threshold is typically based on key performance indicators such as SNR, channel quality indicator (CQI), or data throughput. Clients with channel conditions that fall below this threshold are identified and dropped to prevent them from degrading the overall system performance. This approach ensures that the network resources are utilized more efficiently, as only clients with favorable channel conditions are allowed to participate in the communication, thereby reducing the likelihood of errors and retransmissions.

The combination of the precoding factor and the threshold-based strategy provides a robust framework for managing clients in CF massive MIMO systems. The precoding factor enhances the quality of the received signal, while the threshold-based strategy ensures that only high-quality clients are active in the network. This dual approach not only improves the overall system performance but also enhances the reliability and efficiency of the communication process. By dynamically adjusting the precoding factor and applying the threshold-based strategy, the system can adapt to varying channel conditions and maintain optimal performance, even in challenging environments.

## 5.2 Fluid Antenna Systems and Spatial Correlation Models

### 5.2.1 Performance Gains of FAS in 6G Networks
Frequency Agile Spectrum (FAS) technology has emerged as a promising solution to enhance the performance of 6G networks, particularly in terms of spectral efficiency (SE) and data rate. By enabling dynamic and flexible spectrum utilization, FAS allows for the simultaneous operation of multiple communication links across a wide range of frequencies, thereby significantly increasing the overall network capacity. In CF mMIMO systems, FAS can leverage the dense deployment of Access Points (APs) to create a highly adaptive and resilient network infrastructure [15]. This adaptability is crucial for handling the diverse and dynamic traffic patterns expected in 6G, where the number of connected devices and the volume of data traffic are projected to increase exponentially [13].

The performance gains of FAS in 6G networks are further amplified by its ability to mitigate interference and improve link reliability. In traditional multi-antenna systems, interference management is a significant challenge, especially in dense environments where multiple users and APs coexist. FAS addresses this issue by dynamically adjusting the frequency allocation based on real-time channel conditions and traffic demands. This dynamic adjustment not only reduces interference but also optimizes the use of available spectrum, leading to higher SE and improved Quality of Service (QoS) [10]. Additionally, the integration of FAS with advanced signal processing techniques, such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), can further enhance the performance gains by creating controllable and predictable propagation environments.

Moreover, the deployment of FAS in 6G networks can significantly enhance the energy efficiency of the system [11]. By intelligently managing the spectrum and adapting to the varying traffic loads, FAS can reduce the power consumption of both APs and user equipment (UE). This is particularly important in 6G, where the massive deployment of IoT devices and the continuous demand for high-speed data transmission pose significant energy challenges [3]. The ability of FAS to dynamically allocate resources and optimize power usage makes it a key technology for achieving the sustainability goals of 6G networks. Overall, the combination of FAS with CF mMIMO and other advanced 6G technologies promises to deliver a robust, efficient, and scalable communication infrastructure for the future [15].

### 5.2.2 Novel Spatial Block-Correlation Model for FAS
In the realm of Full-Aperture Scanning (FAS), the development of accurate and computationally efficient spatial correlation models is crucial for optimizing system performance. The novel spatial block-correlation model introduced in this section aims to bridge the gap between theoretical precision and practical feasibility. This model leverages a block-diagonal structure to approximate the spatial correlation matrix, thereby reducing the computational complexity associated with full matrix inversion and eigenvalue decomposition. By partitioning the correlation matrix into smaller, manageable blocks, the model can effectively capture the local spatial dependencies while maintaining a high degree of accuracy.

The block-diagonal spatial correlation model is particularly advantageous in FAS systems, where the spatial configuration of radiating elements can be dynamically adjusted. This flexibility allows the model to adapt to various environmental conditions and system configurations, making it a versatile tool for both theoretical analysis and practical implementation. The model's ability to capture the spectral characteristics of arbitrary correlation functions ensures its applicability across a wide range of scenarios, from urban environments with dense multipath to rural areas with sparse propagation paths. Moreover, the block-diagonal structure facilitates the integration of non-ideal hardware effects, such as phase synchronization errors and hardware impairments, into the system model.

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed block-correlation model, extensive simulations and performance analyses have been conducted. The results demonstrate that the model accurately predicts the performance of FAS systems under various conditions, including different levels of spatial correlation and varying degrees of hardware imperfections. The block-diagonal approximation not only simplifies the computational requirements but also enhances the robustness of the system against practical constraints. This makes the model a valuable asset for researchers and engineers working on the design and optimization of FAS systems, paving the way for more efficient and reliable communication networks.

### 5.2.3 Theoretical Analysis and Simulation Studies for FAS
The theoretical analysis of Fluidic Antenna Systems (FAS) has primarily focused on understanding the impact of dynamic changes in the antenna configuration on the overall system performance. This involves the study of how the reconfigurability of FAS affects parameters such as gain, radiation pattern, and operating frequency [21]. The complexity of these systems necessitates the development of accurate yet tractable models that can capture the dynamic behavior of FAS under various operating conditions. One of the key challenges in this area is the accurate modeling of the spatial correlation between the radiating elements, especially when the elements are in close proximity and can dynamically change their positions. Traditional models, such as Jakes’s model, which assume isotropic propagation, are often too simplistic and can lead to misleading conclusions. Therefore, recent research has aimed to develop more sophisticated correlation models that can better reflect the dynamic nature of FAS.

Simulation studies have played a crucial role in validating the theoretical models and exploring the practical implications of FAS. These studies have typically involved the use of advanced simulation tools to model the behavior of FAS under different scenarios, including varying environmental conditions and different levels of reconfigurability. One of the key findings from these simulations is the significant improvement in spectral efficiency and energy efficiency that can be achieved through the intelligent reconfiguration of the radiating elements. For instance, by dynamically adjusting the positions of the elements, FAS can achieve a stronger level of channel hardening effect, which is essential for maintaining robust communication links in highly dynamic environments. Additionally, simulations have also highlighted the potential of FAS in achieving high data rates and low latency, making them particularly suitable for applications such as virtual reality and augmented reality.

However, the theoretical and simulation studies of FAS have also revealed several challenges that need to be addressed for their practical implementation. One of the primary challenges is the development of efficient algorithms for the real-time reconfiguration of the radiating elements. These algorithms must be able to adapt quickly to changes in the environment and user demands while minimizing computational complexity. Another challenge is the accurate modeling of the hardware impairments, such as phase noise and non-linearities, which can significantly affect the performance of FAS. Recent research has explored the impact of these impairments on the system performance and has proposed various mitigation techniques. Despite these challenges, the theoretical and simulation studies have demonstrated the potential of FAS to revolutionize wireless communication systems, particularly in scenarios requiring high adaptability and performance.

## 5.3 Phase Noise and Spectral Efficiency

### 5.3.1 Impact of 3GPP Time-Frequency Resource Allocation on Phase Noise
The 3GPP time-frequency resource allocation plays a crucial role in determining the impact of phase noise (PN) on the performance of 5G and beyond communication systems [14]. In particular, the allocation of resources in the time and frequency domains directly influences the coherence time and bandwidth, which are critical parameters for mitigating PN. The coherence time, defined as the duration over which the channel remains relatively constant, is inversely proportional to the frequency offset caused by PN. Similarly, the coherence bandwidth, which is the range of frequencies over which the channel can be considered flat, is affected by the phase variations induced by PN. Therefore, the 3GPP resource block (RB) allocation, which typically spans 12 subcarriers in the frequency domain and one or multiple OFDM symbols in the time domain, must be carefully designed to minimize the effects of PN.

The impact of 3GPP resource allocation on PN is further exacerbated by the hardware limitations of the local oscillators (LOs) used in the RF front-end of communication devices. A realistic phase noise model that accurately captures the LO phase drift is essential for evaluating the performance of 3GPP-compliant OFDM systems [14]. The PN model commonly used in the literature, which assumes a phase drift variance of 0.23 radians per OFDM symbol, may overestimate the actual hardware performance [14]. Hardware manufacturers report phase noise levels that are an order of magnitude smaller, suggesting that the PN impact on system performance may be less severe than previously thought. However, the discrepancy between the assumed and actual PN levels highlights the need for a more accurate and hardware-inspired PN model that can better reflect the behavior of affordable software-defined radios (SDRs).

To evaluate the impact of realistic PN on the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) of a 3GPP-compliant OFDM system, we simulate a large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with 64 antennas. The simulation results indicate that the SE is significantly affected by the PN, especially in scenarios where the coherence time and bandwidth are limited by the 3GPP resource allocation. The use of a more accurate PN model reveals that the SE degradation can be mitigated by optimizing the resource allocation strategy to better match the coherence properties of the channel. This finding underscores the importance of considering PN in the design of 3GPP time-frequency resource allocation schemes, particularly for high-performance 5G and beyond systems.

### 5.3.2 Hardware-Inspired PN Model for Local Oscillator Phase Drift
The development of a hardware-inspired phase noise (PN) model for local oscillator (LO) phase drift is crucial for accurately simulating and analyzing the performance of modern communication systems, particularly in the context of cooperative fully connected (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems. Traditional models, such as those based on a discrete-time independent Wiener process, have been widely used to approximate LO phase noise. However, these models often overestimate the phase drift, leading to significant discrepancies when compared to real-world hardware performance. For instance, while theoretical models predict a phase drift variance of 0.23 radians per OFDM symbol, hardware manufacturers report values that are an order of magnitude smaller, highlighting the need for a more realistic approach.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a hardware-inspired PN model that closely aligns with the characteristics of actual LOs found in affordable software-defined radios (SDRs). This model incorporates the physical mechanisms underlying LO phase noise, including thermal fluctuations and flicker noise, which are critical for accurately capturing the low-frequency behavior of the LO. By integrating these physical phenomena, the model provides a more faithful representation of the phase drift, thereby enabling a more precise evaluation of its impact on system performance. Specifically, the model accounts for the time-varying nature of the LO phase noise, which is essential for understanding its effects on both single-carrier and OFDM-based systems [14].

The practical implications of this hardware-inspired PN model are significant, especially in the context of 3GPP-compliant OFDM systems. By simulating a CF mMIMO system using this model, we can assess the impact of realistic LO phase noise on key performance metrics, such as uplink spectral efficiency (SE). Our simulations reveal that the realistic PN model leads to a more modest degradation in performance compared to the ideal LO case, but still highlights the importance of considering LO phase noise in system design [14]. This model serves as a valuable tool for researchers and engineers, enabling them to develop more robust and efficient communication systems that can operate effectively in the presence of practical hardware limitations.

### 5.3.3 Simulation of CF mMIMO Systems for Uplink Spectral Efficiency
Simulation of Cell-Free Massive MIMO (CF mMIMO) systems for uplink spectral efficiency involves a detailed examination of the impact of various system parameters and environmental factors on the overall performance. Key aspects include the modeling of channel conditions, the effect of hardware impairments, and the synchronization mechanisms between user equipment (UE) and access points (APs). In particular, the phase synchronization between UEs and APs is crucial for coherent processing, which is the cornerstone of CF mMIMO [14]. The simulation frameworks often incorporate realistic models of phase noise (PN), which can significantly degrade system performance if not properly accounted for. For instance, the use of a discrete-time independent Wiener process to model PN has been shown to provide a more accurate representation of the phase variations in practical systems, leading to more reliable simulation outcomes.

The simulation of CF mMIMO systems also necessitates a thorough investigation of the uplink channel, where the simultaneous transmission of data from multiple UEs poses unique challenges [14]. Techniques such as Over-The-Air Federated Learning (OTA-FL) have been proposed to optimize the uplink spectral efficiency by enabling simultaneous and non-orthogonal transmission of model updates from multiple clients [20]. This approach leverages the principles of Over-the-Air Computation (AirComp) to aggregate the transmitted signals directly over the air, thereby reducing the overhead associated with traditional orthogonal multiple access schemes. However, the effectiveness of OTA-FL is highly dependent on the quality of the uplink channel, which can be adversely affected by factors such as Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and channel fading [20]. These impairments can lead to errors in the aggregated model, necessitating robust error correction mechanisms and efficient resource allocation strategies.

To further enhance the uplink spectral efficiency in CF mMIMO systems, recent simulations have focused on optimizing the allocation of uplink channel bandwidth among multiple UEs. This involves developing sophisticated algorithms that can dynamically adjust the transmission power and modulation schemes based on the current channel conditions and the specific requirements of each UE. Additionally, the simulation studies have explored the use of advanced signal processing techniques, such as precoding and beamforming, to mitigate interference and improve the overall system capacity. These techniques are essential for achieving the high spectral efficiency required for next-generation wireless networks, particularly in dense urban environments where the demand for high-speed data services is rapidly increasing.
