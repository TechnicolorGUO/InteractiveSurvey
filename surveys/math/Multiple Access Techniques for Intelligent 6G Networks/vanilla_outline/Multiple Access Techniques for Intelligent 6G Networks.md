The study demonstrates significant improvements in spectral efficiency, given by:
$$
SE = \log_2\left(1 + \frac{P|h|^2}{N_0}\right),
$$
where $P$ is the transmit power, $|h|$ represents the channel gain, and $N_0$ is the noise power spectral density.

## 4.1 Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)

NOMA is a promising technique that allows multiple users to share the same time-frequency resource block by exploiting power domain multiplexing. Unlike traditional OMA, NOMA enables simultaneous transmission of multiple signals, thereby improving spectral efficiency.

### 4.1.1 Principles and Mechanisms

In NOMA, users are grouped based on their channel conditions, and signals are superimposed at different power levels. At the receiver side, successive interference cancellation (SIC) is employed to decode the signals. The power allocation can be mathematically represented as:
$$
\text{Signal Power} = \alpha_i P_t, \quad \sum_{i=1}^K \alpha_i = 1,
$$
where $P_t$ is the total transmit power, $\alpha_i$ is the power allocation coefficient for user $i$, and $K$ is the number of users sharing the resource.

### 4.1.2 Advantages and Challenges

NOMA offers significant advantages such as enhanced spectral efficiency and support for massive connectivity. However, it also poses challenges like increased complexity due to SIC and sensitivity to imperfect channel state information (CSI). Moreover, fairness in power allocation remains a critical issue.

### 4.1.3 Recent Advances in NOMA for 6G

Recent research has focused on integrating NOMA with advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to optimize power allocation and improve CSI estimation. Additionally, NOMA combined with IRS has shown potential in enhancing coverage and capacity.

## 4.2 Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) Enhancements

### 4.3.1 IRS Fundamentals

An IRS consists of passive reflecting elements that adjust the phase shift of incident signals. By intelligently configuring these elements, IRS can enhance signal strength and reduce interference.

### 4.3.2 Application in Multiple Access

In the context of multiple access, IRS can be used to create virtual multi-path channels, enabling more efficient resource utilization. This approach complements NOMA and OMA by mitigating interference and extending coverage.

## 4.4 Hybrid Multiple Access Schemes

### 4.4.1 Combining NOMA and OMA

Hybrid NOMA-OMA schemes partition the spectrum into orthogonal sub-bands, where NOMA is applied within each sub-band. This approach reduces the complexity of SIC while maintaining the benefits of NOMA.

### 4.4.2 Joint Optimization Approaches

To fully exploit the potential of hybrid schemes, joint optimization frameworks are developed. These frameworks consider factors such as power allocation, user grouping, and IRS configuration simultaneously. An example optimization problem can be formulated as:
$$
\max_{\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}} \quad R(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}) \\
\text{subject to: } \sum_{i=1}^K p_i \leq P_t, \quad x_i \in \{0, 1\},
$$
where $R(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p})$ represents the achievable rate, $\mathbf{x}$ denotes the user grouping decision, and $\mathbf{p}$ represents the power allocation vector.

| Technique | Spectral Efficiency | Complexity |

# 5 Performance Evaluation and Comparison

In this section, we evaluate and compare the performance of various multiple access techniques that are relevant to intelligent 6G networks. The evaluation focuses on key metrics such as spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, latency, and reliability. Additionally, a comparative analysis is provided based on both simulation results and real-world implementations.

## 5.1 Metrics for Assessing Multiple Access Techniques

To effectively assess the suitability of different multiple access techniques for 6G networks, it is essential to define appropriate performance metrics. Below, we discuss three critical metrics: spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and latency/reliability.

### 5.1.1 Spectral Efficiency

Spectral efficiency is a measure of how efficiently the available spectrum is utilized. It is typically expressed in bits per second per Hertz (bps/Hz). For NOMA-based systems, the spectral efficiency can be enhanced by allowing multiple users to share the same time-frequency resource block. The achievable spectral efficiency $ R $ for NOMA can be expressed as:
$$
R = \log_2\left(1 + \frac{P_s|h_s|^2}{N_0} + \frac{P_w|h_w|^2}{N_0 + P_s|h_s|^2}\right),
$$
where $ P_s $ and $ P_w $ are the powers allocated to strong and weak users, respectively, $ |h_s| $ and $ |h_w| $ represent channel gains, and $ N_0 $ is the noise power spectral density.

For OMA-based systems, the spectral efficiency is generally lower due to orthogonal resource allocation. However, advancements in modern OMA variants may partially mitigate this limitation.

### 5.1.2 Energy Efficiency

Energy efficiency refers to the amount of data transmitted per unit of energy consumed. In the context of 6G, minimizing energy consumption while maintaining high throughput is crucial. IRS-based multiple access techniques have shown promise in improving energy efficiency by leveraging passive beamforming. The energy efficiency $ E $ can be defined as:
$$
E = \frac{T}{P_{\text{total}}},
$$
where $ T $ represents the total transmitted data and $ P_{\text{total}} $ is the total power consumption.

Hybrid multiple access schemes combining NOMA and OMA offer a trade-off between spectral and energy efficiency. These schemes dynamically allocate resources based on user demands and network conditions.

### 5.1.3 Latency and Reliability

Latency and reliability are critical for ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) applications in 6G. NOMA achieves reduced latency by enabling simultaneous transmission, but interference management becomes more complex. On the other hand, OMA ensures reliable transmission through orthogonal resource allocation at the cost of higher latency.

IRS-based access enhances reliability by creating constructive interference patterns tailored to specific users. A table summarizing the latency and reliability characteristics of different techniques is provided below:

| Technique          | Latency       | Reliability   |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------|
| NOMA              | Low           | Moderate      |
| OMA               | High          | High          |
| IRS-Based Access  | Moderate      | High          |
| Hybrid Schemes    | Adjustable    | Adjustable    |

## 5.2 Comparative Analysis of Techniques

This subsection provides a detailed comparison of the multiple access techniques discussed earlier, focusing on their performance under simulated and real-world conditions.

### 5.2.1 Simulation Results

Simulation studies reveal that NOMA outperforms traditional OMA in terms of spectral efficiency, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous user distributions. For instance, simulations conducted using MATLAB indicate that NOMA achieves up to 40% higher spectral efficiency compared to OMA under similar network conditions.

IRS-based access demonstrates superior energy efficiency, especially in dense urban environments where line-of-sight paths are abundant. A figure illustrating the energy savings achieved by IRS is shown below:

![](placeholder_for_irs_energy_savings)

Hybrid multiple access schemes exhibit flexibility in adapting to varying traffic demands, achieving a balance between spectral and energy efficiency.

### 5.2.2 Real-World Implementations

Real-world deployments of these techniques highlight practical challenges and opportunities. For example, early trials of NOMA in 5G networks confirm its potential for enhancing spectral efficiency but also underscore the need for advanced interference cancellation algorithms.

IRS-based access has been experimentally validated in laboratory settings, demonstrating significant improvements in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, large-scale deployment requires addressing issues related to hardware complexity and calibration.

Hybrid schemes, while theoretically promising, face challenges in terms of implementation complexity and computational overhead. Nonetheless, ongoing research aims to address these limitations through machine learning-based optimization approaches.

# 6 Challenges and Open Issues
The development of multiple access techniques for intelligent 6G networks is fraught with challenges that must be addressed to fully realize the potential of next-generation communication systems. This section explores some of the key challenges, including interference management in dense networks, security concerns, scalability requirements, and standardization efforts.

## 6.1 Interference Management in Dense Networks
As the density of devices and base stations increases in 6G networks, managing interference becomes a critical issue. The coexistence of numerous users in close proximity exacerbates interference levels, which can degrade system performance if not properly mitigated. Traditional interference management techniques such as power control and frequency reuse may not suffice for the ultra-dense environments envisioned for 6G.

Advanced approaches like coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission and reception, as well as intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), offer promising solutions. IRS, in particular, can dynamically adjust its reflective elements to steer signals and mitigate interference. Mathematically, the optimization problem for IRS-based interference management can be formulated as:
$$
\min_{\mathbf{\Theta}} \sum_{k=1}^{K} I_k(\mathbf{\Theta})
$$
where $I_k(\mathbf{\Theta})$ represents the interference experienced by user $k$, and $\mathbf{\Theta}$ denotes the configuration of the IRS.

![](placeholder_for_irs_interference_management_diagram)

## 6.2 Security Concerns in Multiple Access
Security remains a paramount concern in the context of multiple access techniques for 6G. With the proliferation of IoT devices and the integration of AI-driven technologies, ensuring secure communications becomes increasingly complex. NOMA, for instance, introduces unique vulnerabilities due to its superposition coding and successive interference cancellation (SIC) mechanisms. An eavesdropper with sufficient computational resources could potentially exploit SIC to intercept confidential information.

To address these concerns, physical-layer security techniques such as artificial noise injection and secret key generation can be employed. Additionally, blockchain-based authentication schemes may enhance the security of device-to-device (D2D) communications within the network.

| Technique | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-----------|------------|

Scalability and flexibility are essential attributes for accommodating the diverse range of applications expected in 6G networks. From massive machine-type communications (mMTC) to ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), multiple access techniques must adapt to varying traffic patterns and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements.

Hybrid multiple access schemes, combining NOMA and OMA, offer a flexible framework for addressing these needs. By leveraging the strengths of both techniques, hybrid schemes can dynamically allocate resources based on real-time network conditions. For example, NOMA can be used for mMTC scenarios where many low-data-rate devices coexist, while OMA can serve high-priority URLLC traffic.

$$
R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{NOMA}} + R_{\text{OMA}}
$$
where $R_{\text{total}}$ represents the total achievable rate.

## 6.4 Standardization Efforts for 6G
Standardization plays a pivotal role in ensuring interoperability and widespread adoption of new technologies. While 5G standards have been largely established under the auspices of 3GPP, the path forward for 6G is still being charted. Key players in academia, industry, and government are actively collaborating to define the technical specifications and performance benchmarks for 6G.

Open issues include determining the optimal trade-offs between spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and latency, as well as establishing guidelines for integrating emerging technologies such as AI, quantum communication, and terahertz bands into the 6G ecosystem. International cooperation will be crucial to harmonizing global standards and fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving field.

These hybrid approaches could leverage the strengths of both paradigms to enhance spectral efficiency while maintaining low complexity. For instance, joint optimization frameworks incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms can dynamically adapt resource allocation based on network conditions, as expressed by:

$$
\text{Maximize } f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} R_i - \lambda C_i,
$$
where $R_i$ represents the achievable rate for user $i$, $C_i$ denotes the computational cost, and $\lambda$ balances the trade-off between performance and complexity.

Another promising direction involves Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS)-based multiple access. IRS has shown potential in mitigating interference and enhancing coverage, but its integration with advanced access techniques remains underexplored.
