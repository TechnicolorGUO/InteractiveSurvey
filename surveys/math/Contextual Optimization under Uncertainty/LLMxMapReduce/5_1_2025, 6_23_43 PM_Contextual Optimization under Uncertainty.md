# 0. Contextual Optimization under Uncertainty  

# 1. Introduction  

Mathematical optimization, or mathematical programming, is fundamentally concerned with selecting the optimal element from a set of available alternatives based on a specific criterion [6]. This field encompasses a broad spectrum of problems and methodologies, applicable across diverse quantitative disciplines including computer science, engineering, operations research, and economics [6]. While classical optimization often assumes complete knowledge of problem parameters, realworld decision-making is invariably complicated by uncertainty and influenced by context. Uncertainty arises when outcomes or parameters are not precisely known, requiring decision-makers to account for potential variability [10]. Context, on the other hand, refers to the surrounding conditions, information, or state that may influence the relationship between decisions and outcomes [4,16].​

Contextual Optimization under Uncertainty integrates these three concepts to address complex decision problems where the optimal action depends on available contextual information, yet outcomes are subject to various forms of uncertainty. This paradigm is essential in dynamic and partially observable environments, such as managing operations in urban logistics with stochastic demands [11], optimizing resource allocation in wireless networks [16], or making sequential decisions like recommending items in recommender systems or allocating traffic in online marketing campaigns [1,4]. The necessity of this combined approach stems from the limitations of methods that address uncertainty or context in isolation. For example, traditional multi-task learning (MTL) approaches using weighted linear combinations struggle with conflicting tasks, indicating a need to model trade-offs beyond simple objective aggregation, potentially incorporating task-specific context or uncertainties [7]. Similarly, while traditional psychological models offer insights into cognitive processes, they often lack the predictive power required for forecasting human decision-making trajectories in dynamic tasks, highlighting the need for methods that can leverage sequential context and account for inherent behavioral uncertainty [12]. Basic multiarmed bandit (MAB) problems capture uncertainty and the exploration-exploitation trade-off but are limited by their inability to incorporate user-specific or situational context, which contextual bandits address by conditioning decisions on side information [1,2,4].​  

The challenges in Contextual Optimization under Uncertainty are significant. Managing uncertainty requires robust techniques that can account for unknown outcomes, whether arising from inherent randomness (aleatoric uncertainty) or lack of knowledge (epistemic uncertainty) [20]. For instance, predicting human behavior involves significant uncertainty due to its inherent unpredictability, necessitating belief-based approaches or sophisticated predictive models that infer likely consequences based on available information and learned patterns [8,12]. Integrating context effectively means handling potentially high-dimensional data and identifying the relevant features that inform the decision process [3,4]. Optimization methods must be computationally efficient and scalable, particularly for large-scale problems where first-order gradients may be noisy or unavailable, as highlighted by the challenges in stochastic quasi-Newton methods and zeroth-order optimization for deep learning [3,15]. Furthermore, the exploration-exploitation dilemma is central; agents must balance trying novel actions (exploration) to reduce epistemic uncertainty and discover better options with exploiting actions known to yield high rewards (exploitation) based on current knowledge and context [2,4].​  

Existing approaches that tackle only uncertainty, such as traditional stochastic programming, or only context, such as context-aware decision rules without explicit uncertainty modeling, are insufficient for problems where both factors are intrinsically linked and dynamic. Stochastic modeling techniques like two-stage stochastic programming and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide frameworks for managing uncertainty, often combined with methods like Benders decomposition and reinforcement learning [11]. However, effectively incorporating rich, dynamic context within these frameworks while simultaneously optimizing under uncertainty presents ongoing research challenges. The Decision Sciences field recognizes the complexity of human decision-making under uncertainty, considering both normative (ideal rational) and descriptive (actual behavior with biases) perspectives, emphasizing the need for approaches that can improve decision-making quality in uncertain, often socially influenced, contexts [8,10].  

This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of research in Contextual Optimization under Uncertainty. We begin by laying the theoretical foundations and formally defining the problem space. Subsequent sections will delve into various modeling frameworks and algorithmic approaches developed to address these challenges, including methods from reinforcement learning, stochastic optimization, and bandit theory. We will analyze their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability to different problem domains, exploring how they integrate contextual information and handle different types of uncertainty. Finally, we will discuss key applications and potential future research directions in this critical and evolving field.​  

# 2. Background and Foundations  

Contextual optimization under uncertainty sits at the intersection of several fundamental fields, requiring a solid understanding of mathematical optimization, decision theory, uncertainty modeling, contextual information handling, and sequential decision-making frameworks. This section lays the groundwork by introducing these core concepts, outlining their basic principles, common approaches, and inherent challenges.​  

At its core, mathematical optimization, also known as mathematical programming, involves finding the best possible solution (input values or decision variables) for a problem defined by an objective function to be minimized or maximized, subject to a set of constraints that define the feasible set [6,19]. Formally, an optimization problem seeks an element \(x_0 \in A\) that satisfies either \(\min_{x \in A} f(x)\) or \(\max_{x \in A} f(x)\), where \(f : A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) is the objective function and \(A\) is the feasible set determined by constraints [6]. Problems are broadly categorized based on the nature of variables and constraints, including distinctions between continuous optimization (variables take real values) and discrete optimization (variables are restricted to integers or specific sets) [9]. Further classifications include constrained vs. unconstrained problems, and specific types like linear programming, quadratic programming, and mixed integer programming [9]. A notable extension is multi-objective optimization, aiming to find Pareto-optimal solutions that balance multiple competing objectives [7,9]. Algorithmic approaches range from zero-order to first-order methods leveraging gradient information [3,18].​  

Decision theory under uncertainty provides frameworks for making rational choices when outcomes are not certain. The field has evolved from simpler models to more sophisticated ones [23]. Early expected value theory suggested choosing the action with the highest average outcome, but this failed to account for subjective preferences and risk attitudes [23]. Utility theory addressed this by proposing the maximization of expected utility, where outcomes are valued based on subjective satisfaction rather than monetary value, enabling the modeling of risk aversion or risk-seeking behavior through concave or convex utility functions [23]. While a significant improvement, it assumes known probabilities and stable preferences. Bayesian decision theory further integrates probabilistic reasoning, allowing for explicit modeling of uncertainty through probability distributions and sequential updating of beliefs based on new evidence [8,20,24]. This framework is particularly adept at handling epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty due to lack of knowledge) by refining probability distributions as more data becomes available, contrasting with "belief-free" methods [8]. However, real-world decision-making, especially in dynamic or social contexts, often deviates from these models, highlighting limitations in capturing complex human behaviors, strategic interactions, and the exploration-exploitation trade-off inherent in dynamic settings [4,12]. Alternative theories like regret theory attempt to model psychological factors such as anticipated regret [10].  

Effectively addressing uncertainty in optimization requires robust uncertainty modeling and representation methods [20,24]. These methods aim to capture both aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness) and epistemic uncertainty. Probabilistic models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian networks, represent uncertainty using probability distributions, offering high expressiveness but requiring strong assumptions about distribution validity and potentially high computational cost [8,24]. They naturally distinguish between aleatoric (noise in data) and epistemic (uncertainty in model parameters) uncertainty. Set-based models, including Robust Optimization, define uncertainty as a set of possible values for uncertain parameters, avoiding distributional assumptions and providing strong worst-case guarantees [24]. However, they can yield overly conservative solutions and are sensitive to the definition of the uncertainty set. Scenario-based approaches discretize uncertainty into a finite set of possible outcomes or scenarios, often used in stochastic programming frameworks like two-stage stochastic programming [11,24]. They are intuitive and flexible but face challenges in scenario generation and computational scalability with many scenarios or stages. The choice among these methods involves tradeoffs between expressiveness, computational complexity, and robustness to model misspecification [20,24]. Other methods like Information-Gap Decision Theory, Fuzzy Logic, and techniques addressing ambiguity with imprecise probabilities also exist [10,24].​  

Contextual information plays a vital role in tailoring decisions to specific circumstances, moving beyond generic optimization solutions. This context can include user-specific data (e.g., device, location, history), recipient features in personalized applications, environmental factors (e.g., field sampling, correlations), social and interactional dynamics (actions of others, social preferences), and temporal sequences of past events [1,4,8,10,12,13,17,23]. Techniques for modeling and integrating context range from simple feature vectors and parameterizing models based on context (e.g., average contribution in group settings) to more complex representations like knowledge graphs and ontologies [1,4,8,10,17,20,24]. Algorithms integrate context in various ways; for example, contextual bandits condition arm selection on context, Bayesian models incorporate context into priors or likelihoods, and recurrent neural networks use internal states to summarize temporal context [1,4,8,12]. Challenges include handling high-dimensional context, noise, heterogeneity, and complex social or strategic interactions [10,17,20,23,24].  

For problems involving sequential decisions over time, frameworks like Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are foundational [11,23]. MDPs model agents in fully observable environments transitioning between states probabilistically based on actions, with context incorporated directly into the state definition [11,23]. POMDPs extend MDPs to scenarios with partial observability, where agents rely on observations to maintain a belief state (probability distribution over states), which acts as a sufficient statistic for decision-making under uncertainty about the true context [8,20,23,24]. Solving MDPs and POMDPs can be computationally intensive, especially for large state spaces, leading to the use of approximate methods and Reinforcement Learning techniques [8,13]. Beyond statespace models, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a powerful mechanism for capturing complex relational contextual information by processing graph-structured data [13]. GNNs learn representations by aggregating information across nodes and edges, effectively encoding both attributes and structural relationships. These learned graph embeddings can then inform sequential decision policies or planning algorithms, allowing systems to leverage intricate contextual dependencies [13]. While MDPs/POMDPs explicitly handle uncertainty through probabilities and belief states, GNNs typically handle it implicitly by learning from data, though explicit probabilistic GNNs are an active area of research. The choice between these sequential frameworks depends on observability, complexity of context, and computational resources.  

# 2.1 Mathematical Optimization Fundamentals  

Mathematical optimization, also known as mathematical programming, is a fundamental concept involving the selection of   
input values for a real function to maximize or minimize its value [6]. Formally, a mathematical optimization problem can be   
stated as finding an element \(x_0 \in A\) that satisfies either   
\​   
or ​   
\​  

[6]. Here, \(f : A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) represents the objective function, which maps a set \(A\) to the real numbers. The set \(A\) is the feasible set, representing all allowable input values or decision variables that satisfy a given set of constraints [6,19]. Thus, a typical optimization problem is defined by its objective function, decision variables, and constraints [19]. Many problems in machine learning, for instance, are cast as the minimization or maximization of a specific objective function subject to certain constraints [19]. Examples of such formulations in machine learning include Least Squares Regression, Ridge Regression, LASSO (e.g., \(\min_w \lVert Xw - y\rVert_ $2 ^ { \wedge } 2 +$ \lambda \lVert w\rVert_1\)), Support Vector Machines, and Regularized Logistic Regression [18].

Optimization problems can be categorized based on the nature of their decision variables and constraints. Key distinctions include continuous optimization, where variables can take any real value within a range, and discrete optimization, where variables are restricted to integers or specific sets of values [9]. Problems can also be classified as constrained or unconstrained, depending on whether restrictions are placed on the feasible set [9]. Furthermore, various specific problem types exist, such as linear programming (LP), quadratic programming (QP), nonlinear programming (NLP), convex programming (CP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and combinatorial optimization (COP) [9]. A significant class of problems involves optimizing multiple objective functions simultaneously, known as multi-objective optimization (MOP) [7,9]. In multi-objective settings, the goal is typically to find Pareto-optimal solutions, which are solutions that cannot be improved in one objective without degrading performance in at least one other objective [7].  

While the concepts of local and global optima and the associated necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality are fundamental to the theoretical analysis of optimization problems, the provided digests focus primarily on problem formulation, classification by type, and algorithmic approaches (such as zero-order and first-order methods based on gradient information [3,18]), rather than a detailed exposition of these specific theoretical concepts.  

# 2.2 Decision Theory under Uncertainty  

Decision theory under uncertainty constitutes a foundational area of research concerned with how rational agents should make choices when outcomes are not certain. The evolution of this field reflects increasing sophistication in modeling the complexities of uncertain environments and agent preferences. Early approaches centered on the principle of expected value [23]. This theory posits that rational decision-makers should identify all potential outcomes of each action, quantify their respective values and probabilities, and select the action that yields the highest average outcome value over many repetitions [23]. While intuitively appealing for simple scenarios, expected value theory faces significant limitations, notably highlighted by paradoxes such as the St. Petersburg paradox, which demonstrate its failure to account for risk aversion and subjective valuation [23].​

Acknowledging the shortcomings of expected value, decision theory progressed to incorporate the concept of utility. Daniel Bernoulli's critique of expected value led to the proposal of using expected utility instead of expected financial value [23]. Utility theory posits that individuals do not evaluate outcomes based on their monetary value directly, but rather on the subjective satisfaction or "utility" they derive from them. A utility function maps monetary values (or consumption bundles) to a measure of satisfaction, allowing for the modeling of risk preferences, such as risk aversion (where the utility function is concave) or risk-seeking (where it is convex) [23]. Expected utility theory suggests that the rational choice under uncertainty is the one that maximizes the expected value of this subjective utility. While a significant advancement, expected utility theory relies on strong assumptions about agent rationality and the ability to assign precise probabilities and utility values to all outcomes.​  

Further developments integrated probabilistic reasoning, leading to Bayesian decision theory. Bayesian approaches explicitly model uncertainty through probability distributions and provide a framework for updating beliefs based on new evidence. In belief-based decision-making, individuals learn a model of the environment, update their probabilistic beliefs about the state of the world based on observations and rewards, and choose actions informed by these updated beliefs [8]. This contrasts with "belief-free" or "model-free" approaches which rely more on learned stimulus-response mappings or value functions without explicit state representation [8]. Bayesian methods are particularly powerful in handling epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty due to lack of knowledge) by allowing for the sequential refinement of probability distributions as more data becomes available. However, they often demand significant cognitive resources due to the computational complexity of maintaining and updating probability models [8].  

Comparing these theories, expected value theory is the simplest but least descriptive of human behavior and weakest in handling non-linear preferences for risk. Expected utility theory captures risk attitudes through the utility function but assumes known probabilities and stable preferences. Bayesian decision theory offers a robust framework for learning and adapting to uncertainty by updating beliefs, making it more suitable for dynamic environments where information is revealed over time [20,24]. Its strength lies in modeling how agents can reduce epistemic uncertainty through observation. However, unlike expected utility which primarily addresses aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness) given known probabilities, Bayesian methods explicitly grapple with both, providing mechanisms for learning and reducing epistemic uncertainty.​  

Despite the theoretical elegance of these classical frameworks, real-world decision-making, particularly in complex scenarios like the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma or contextual optimization problems, presents challenges that highlight their limitations [12]. Human decision-making often deviates from the predictions of expected utility and Bayesian rationality, leading to the development of alternative theories such as regret theory, which focuses on how anticipated regret over forgone outcomes influences choices under uncertainty [10]. Regret theory considers the psychological impact of comparing the chosen outcome to what might have been, introducing additional complexities to risk attitudes and decision criteria [10]. Furthermore, decision-making under uncertainty in dynamic settings, particularly relevant to contextual optimization, often involves the fundamental exploration-exploitation trade-off [4]. This challenge requires balancing the exploration of potentially better, unknown options with the exploitation of currently known good options, a trade-off not explicitly addressed within the core formulations of classical expected value or utility theory but inherent in sequential Bayesian decision-making processes and a central focus in areas like reinforcement learning and contextual bandits. Traditional models, despite offering interpretable features, frequently fall short in accurately characterizing and predicting the nuances of human decision processes in such complex interactive or dynamic contexts [12].​  

# 2.3 Uncertainty Modeling and Representation  

Uncertainty modeling is a complex statistical and data analysis method crucial for contextual optimization, enabling the identification of key parameters associated with data generation to reduce uncertainty around predictive values [20]. Representing uncertainty effectively is paramount, and various methods exist, each with distinct characteristics concerning expressiveness, computational complexity, and robustness to model misspecification [20,24]. These approaches can capture different types of uncertainty, broadly categorized into aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from inherent randomness, and epistemic uncertainty, which stems from a lack of knowledge about the system or model parameters.

A prominent category involves Probabilistic Models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian networks [24]. These methods represent uncertainty using probability distributions. For instance, a Bayesian framework can model uncertainty about a parameter, like the average probability of contribution in a group $( \theta ~ )$ , using a prior probability distribution, such as a $\mathrm { B e t a } ( \alpha , \beta )$ distribution, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are hyperparameters representing observed contributions and free-rides [8]. Beliefs are updated iteratively using Bayes' rule based on new observations, with the posterior from one step serving as the prior for the next [8]. A decay rate $\gamma$ can be incorporated to allow more recent data to influence updates more strongly, adapting to changing dynamics [8]. Probabilistic models are highly expressive, capable of capturing complex dependencies and providing rich information about the likelihood of different outcomes. They naturally differentiate between aleatoric uncertainty (modeled by the observation noise or inherent variability in the data-generating process) and epistemic uncertainty (represented by the uncertainty in model parameters or structure, often captured via posterior distributions). However, they can be computationally intensive, especially for complex models or large datasets, and their effectiveness heavily relies on the validity of the assumed probability distributions, potentially leading to poor performance if the model is significantly misspecified.  

Set-based Models, including approaches like Robust Optimization, represent uncertainty by defining a set of possible values for uncertain parameters [24]. Instead of assuming a specific probability distribution, these methods aim to find solutions that are optimal or feasible for all possible realizations within a defined uncertainty set. This approach is particularly effective for capturing epistemic uncertainty where precise probabilities are unavailable or unreliable. Robust optimization offers strong guarantees on performance in the worst-case scenario within the uncertainty set, providing robustness against variations. Its expressiveness is limited by the structure of the uncertainty set (e.g., box, ellipsoidal, polyhedral uncertainty). Computationally, solving robust optimization problems can be more challenging than deterministic counterparts, often requiring techniques from convex optimization or duality. A key disadvantage is that  

solutions can be overly conservative, as they are optimized for the worst case, which may be unlikely. Robustness to model misspecification depends on how well the chosen uncertainty set encapsulates the true range of uncertainty.  

Scenario-based Approaches model uncertainty by representing it as a finite collection of possible future outcomes or scenarios [24]. Stochastic programming, including two-stage stochastic programming, and stochastic sequential modeling using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are frameworks that often utilize scenario-based representations [11]. Decisions are made considering their performance across these scenarios, often optimizing expected performance or minimizing risk measures. Scenario generation is critical and can significantly impact the model's accuracy and computational tractability. This approach can be highly expressive, capable of capturing complex dependencies and non-linear relationships if enough representative scenarios are included. However, computational complexity can explode with the number of scenarios and decision stages. Robustness depends heavily on whether the generated scenarios adequately cover the space of actual possibilities; misspecification in scenario generation can be detrimental. Scenario-based methods can represent both aleatoric (through probabilities assigned to scenarios) and epistemic (if scenarios represent different possible underlying models or parameter values) uncertainty.  

Other methods mentioned include Information-Gap Decision Theory and Fuzzy Logic models [24], offering alternative paradigms for handling uncertainty, particularly when information is imprecise or qualitative. Furthermore, research explores uncertainty related to ambiguity, which refers to situations with imprecise probabilities [10]. Techniques like Almost Stochastic Dominance have been developed to rank distributions when only partial information is available, addressing decision-making under such ambiguity [10].  

In summary, the choice of uncertainty representation method involves trade-offs [20,24]. Probabilistic models offer detailed distributional information but require strong assumptions and can be computationally demanding. Set-based methods provide robustness guarantees but may be conservative and sensitive to the definition of the uncertainty set. Scenariobased approaches are intuitive and flexible but face challenges in scenario generation and computational scale. Explicitly considering the type of uncertainty (aleatoric vs. epistemic) and the desired properties of the solution (e.g., expected performance vs. worst-case robustness) is crucial in selecting the most appropriate representation method for a given contextual optimization problem.​  

# 2.4 Contextual Information Modeling and Integration  

The effective incorporation of contextual information is fundamental to optimizing decisions under uncertainty, allowing systems to adapt to dynamic environments and individual specificities.

Contextual information encompasses a wide array of factors that influence the optimal decision, moving beyond static problem definitions. These factors can be broadly classified into several types based on the insights gathered from relevant literature. User-specific data constitutes a significant category, including device type, location, past behavior, and purchase history, which are crucial for personalizing recommendations and content display [1,4]. Similarly, recipient features are utilized in personalized decision-making, particularly in fields like healthcare and marketing [10]. Environmental or systemlevel factors are also vital, such as field sampling information, natural correlations between samples, and heterogeneity across pools in optimization problems like pooled testing [17]. Furthermore, social and interactional context, including the actions of other participants in multi-agent systems or group decision settings, and considerations of social preferences like fairness and equality in decisions affecting others, play a critical role [8,10,12,23]. Temporal context, represented by past actions and outcomes, is essential for sequential decision processes [12].​  

Representing and encoding this diverse range of contextual information is a key step in enabling optimization algorithms to leverage it. While general methods like feature vectors are implicitly common for encoding user and recipient-specific data [1,4,10], other representation techniques such as knowledge graphs and ontologies are recognized as potential approaches for structuring complex contextual relationships [20,24]. Specific applications may employ tailored representations; for instance, the context of other group members' actions in a public goods game can be modeled using a single parameter like the average probability of contribution $\theta$ [8]. For sequential contexts, recurrent network architectures process sequences of past actions and outcomes as inputs, implicitly encoding the temporal dependency [12].​  

Different optimization algorithms integrate contextual information in varied ways. Contextual bandit algorithms, for instance, explicitly condition their arm selection strategy on the observed context features to maximize expected reward, thereby tailoring decisions to individual contexts [1,4]. In statistical modeling for optimization problems, context such as field sampling data, correlations, and heterogeneity is integrated to inform model structure and parameters, improving efficiency and accuracy, as demonstrated in pooled testing methods [17]. Recurrent neural networks, such as LSTMs, integrate sequential context by maintaining an internal state that summarizes past information, which then influences the prediction of future decisions or actions [12]. Bayesian models integrate context by incorporating it into the prior beliefs or likelihood functions used for updating posteriors and making decisions, such as integrating information about others' likely behavior in group settings [8]. Personalized decision strategies, often informed by experimental data, directly map recipient features (context) to optimized actions or policies [10].  

Despite the benefits, handling contextual information presents several challenges. High-dimensional context spaces are common, necessitating effective feature extraction techniques and dimensionality reduction methods to manage computational complexity and avoid the curse of dimensionality [20,24]. Noisy or unreliable contextual data can degrade optimization performance, requiring robust modeling approaches. Furthermore, substantial heterogeneity across contextual instances, such as non-identical samples in pooled testing, poses significant modeling challenges to ensure sensitivity and efficiency across diverse conditions [17]. Integrating complex human and multi-agent contexts, which involve intricate interactions, social preferences, and potentially divergent opinions and objectives, introduces further complexities related to fairness, ethical considerations, and the difficulty of accurately modeling non-stationary or strategic behaviors [10,23]. Addressing these challenges is critical for developing effective contextual optimization methods.  

# 2.5 Sequential Decision Making and Graph Models  

Classical decision theory typically addresses static choices under uncertainty. Extending this framework to scenarios where decisions are made sequentially over time, with outcomes influencing future states and available actions, necessitates more sophisticated models.  

Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) serve as fundamental frameworks for modeling stochastic sequential decision-making problems [11,23].  

An MDP models an agent interacting with an environment over discrete time steps. At each step, the agent observes the full state of the environment, takes an action, receives a reward, and the environment transitions to a new state according to a probabilistic function dependent on the current state and action. The core elements are states, actions, transition probabilities, and reward functions [11,23]. MDPs assume full observability, meaning the agent always knows the true state of the system [23]. Contextual information in an MDP is directly incorporated into the definition of its state space. A sufficiently rich state representation must encode all information necessary to determine the probabilities of future states and expected rewards.​  

POMDPs extend MDPs to situations where the agent cannot directly observe the true state of the environment but instead receives observations that are probabilistically related to the state [23]. This partial observability introduces a critical challenge: the agent must maintain a belief about the current state, represented by a probability distribution over the possible states [8]. The belief state serves as a sufficient statistic for decision-making, effectively summarizing the history of actions and observations. Contextual information in a POMDP is captured through the observation space and the agent's evolving belief state [8,20,24]. The POMDP framework allows for explicit probabilistic inference of hidden states through belief updates, enabling decision-making under significant uncertainty about the true context [8].  

Beyond traditional state-space models, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful approach to incorporating complex, relational contextual information into decision-making. GNNs are designed to operate on graph-structured data, learning representations (embeddings) for nodes and edges by aggregating information from their local neighborhoods [13]. This iterative message-passing mechanism allows GNNs to capture both the attributes of individual entities (nodes, edges) and the structural relationships between them. These learned representations can encode rich contextual information, such as dependencies between different elements in a system or the influence of neighboring factors.  

Leveraging GNNs for context-aware decision-making involves representing the relevant context as a graph, where nodes and edges carry attributes. A GNN processes this graph to produce contextually informed node- or graph-level embeddings. These embeddings can then serve as input to a decision-making policy or planning algorithm, providing a learned representation of the complex context. For example, in recommendation systems, a user-item interaction graph can be processed by a GNN to generate user and item embeddings that capture preferences and relationships, informing the next best item recommendation. In sequential settings, GNN embeddings representing the current contextual graph state could be used within or alongside MDP/POMDP state representations or policy networks.  

Solving MDPs, POMDPs, and employing GNN-based methods involve different algorithmic approaches with varying computational characteristics [13]. Exact solution methods for MDPs, such as Value Iteration and Policy Iteration, have polynomial complexity in the number of states and actions but can become intractable for very large state spaces. Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, like Q-learning or policy gradient methods, are often used for large MDPs or when the model is unknown, trading off guarantees of optimality for empirical performance and scalability. Solving POMDPs is significantly more computationally challenging due to the continuous belief state space; exact solutions are generally PSPACE-complete. Practical approaches rely on approximate methods like point-based value iteration or methods that sample trajectories and update beliefs [8]. These methods often face scalability issues as the state space or horizon increases. GNN-based methods involve training the network via gradient descent. The computational complexity depends on the graph size (number of nodes and edges) and the GNN architecture. Training can be expensive for large graphs, but techniques like mini-batching or sampling can improve scalability. Inference using a trained GNN is typically faster. While MDPs and POMDPs handle uncertainty formally through probabilities and belief states, GNNs handle uncertainty implicitly by learning from potentially noisy data. Explicit probabilistic GNNs are an area of ongoing research for better uncertainty quantification. The choice of framework depends on the nature of the sequential task, the availability and structure of contextual information, the degree of observability, and the required level of solution optimality versus computational feasibility.  

# 3. Key Approaches and Algorithms  

This section provides an overview and categorization of the principal algorithmic approaches employed in contextual optimization under uncertainty. These methodologies are designed to tackle decision-making problems where optimal actions depend on prevailing contextual information, and the outcomes are subject to various forms of uncertainty. A central challenge across these approaches lies in effectively integrating context and managing uncertainty while navigating the inherent trade-offs between solution robustness, optimality, and computational tractability. Different techniques make distinct assumptions about the nature of uncertainty (e.g., presence of probability distributions or defined uncertainty sets) and the structure of contextual information, leading to varied strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for different problem scales and types [9].​  

One major paradigm is Robust Optimization (RO), which focuses on finding solutions that remain feasible and perform acceptably for all possible realizations of uncertain parameters within a predefined uncertainty set $u$ [20,24]. RO primarily addresses uncertainty by providing performance guarantees under worst-case scenarios, rather than relying on explicit probability distributions. While classical RO does not inherently incorporate context, variants like adaptive robust optimization handle multi-stage problems where decisions adapt to revealed uncertainty, which can be viewed through a contextual lens. The choice of the uncertainty set shape (e.g., box, ellipsoidal, polyhedral) is crucial, influencing the balance between robustness and potential over-conservatism. Transforming the problem into a deterministic robust counterpart ensures feasibility against worst-case scenarios, but the computational complexity and scalability heavily depend on the structure of the uncertainty set and the resulting counterpart formulation [20,24].​  

In contrast, Stochastic Programming (SP) leverages knowledge of probability distributions for uncertain parameters [11,20,24]. It typically employs scenario-based models to represent potential outcomes and optimizes expected performance or risk measures (such as CVaR) [20,24]. SP handles uncertainty probabilistically through scenarios and their associated likelihoods. Context can be implicitly integrated, particularly in multi-stage models where decisions at each stage are conditioned on the history of observations and prior decisions, reflecting the evolving context. SP aims for optimal performance on average or under specific risk preferences, trading off potential suboptimality in individual scenarios for overall probabilistic guarantees. Computational complexity is often a significant challenge, particularly with a large number of scenarios, necessitating techniques like Sample Average Approximation (SAA) and decomposition methods such as Benders decomposition [11,20,24]. R packages for stochastic optimization are available [9].​  

Bayesian Optimization with Context extends standard Bayesian optimization, a method efficient for optimizing expensive black-box functions, by incorporating contextual variables [20,24]. It addresses uncertainty through a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), and uses acquisition functions to guide the search for the optimum. Context is explicitly handled by augmenting the GP model or making the acquisition function context-dependent. This approach is particularly suitable for problems with costly function evaluations and where the objective function depends on context. The trade-off involves balancing exploration and exploitation via the acquisition function and managing the computational cost of GP inference, which can scale poorly with the number of evaluations [20,24].​  

Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) and Contextual Bandits (CB) provide a framework for sequential decision-making with evaluative feedback, addressing the exploration–exploitation dilemma [2]. Traditional MAB is context-free, seeking a single best action by balancing exploration and exploitation using strategies like Epsilon-greedy, UCB, and Thompson Sampling [1,20,24]. Contextual Bandits extend this by incorporating context specific to each decision instance, allowing for personalized actions [2,4]. CB algorithms, such as LinUCB, learn a policy that maps contexts to optimal actions, handling uncertainty through context-aware exploration strategies based on estimated reward uncertainties [4]. This makes them highly suitable for dynamic environments requiring online adaptation and personalization, such as recommendation systems [4]. The computational complexity and scalability of CB depend on the chosen model for the context-reward  

relationship, with LinUCB demonstrating linear scaling with the number of arms but increasing complexity with context dimensionality [4,24].  

Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Contextual Settings is a powerful framework for sequential decision-making in uncertain environments, naturally integrating context into the decision process [2]. RL agents learn optimal policies or value functions conditioned on the observed state or context to maximize cumulative reward. Uncertainty is managed through learning from environmental feedback and strategic exploration. Deep RL, utilizing neural networks, is particularly effective in handling high-dimensional and complex contextual inputs [20,24]. Different RL algorithms offer trade-offs; model-free methods are conceptually simpler but may lack sample efficiency, while deep RL handles complex contexts but often requires extensive data. The choice depends on the problem's structure, complexity, and data availability, with applications ranging from control systems to communication networks [16].​  

Online Learning and Adaptive Optimization encompass algorithms that learn and adapt sequentially from real-time data, distinct from batch processing [4,20,24]. A key aspect is managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in dynamic settings. These methods handle uncertainty by continuously updating models and decisions based on new information. Contextual bandits are a form of online learning [4], and RL algorithms also fall under this umbrella. Adaptive optimization specifically refers to methods that adjust algorithmic parameters (e.g., learning rates in optimization algorithms like Adam) based on observed data and context [19]. Strengths lie in their ability to handle non-stationary environments and provide personalized solutions, while challenges include ensuring stability and assessing long-term performance guarantees [16].  

Integrating Optimization with Predictions involves using machine learning model outputs as inputs to optimization problems. This approach leverages data-driven insights, using context to generate predictions (e.g., predicted demands or actions) [12]. The primary challenge is effectively handling the inherent uncertainty and potential errors in these predictions, which can impact optimization quality. While not a specific algorithmic class for handling uncertainty in the optimization model itself, it necessitates robustness in the downstream optimization process or methods to account for prediction variance. Zero-order optimization (ZOO) techniques, such as Coordinate Gradient Estimation (CGE) and Random Gradient Estimation (RGE), become relevant when the objective function's gradient is inaccessible, for instance, when optimizing based on predictions from a black-box model [3].​  

Finally, various Relevant Optimization Methods from Machine Learning serve as fundamental tools for implementing and solving problems formulated within the above paradigms [18,19]. These include gradient-based methods (Gradient Descent, SGD, Adam) widely used for training learning models that process context [12,18,19], and more advanced techniques like Quasi-Newton methods (BFGS, L-BFGS) [9,18], Conjugate Gradient, and Frank-Wolfe variants [7,18], as well as methods for constrained optimization like Projected Gradient and ADMM [18]. Specialized solvers exist for specific structures like convex quadratic programs (CQPs) [5,9]. While primarily general optimization tools, their stochastic and adaptive variants are relevant for handling noise and adapting to data in uncertain and contextual settings, supporting the larger frameworks discussed.​  

In summary, the field of contextual optimization under uncertainty draws upon diverse algorithmic foundations. Robust Optimization and Stochastic Programming offer structured mathematical frameworks with varying assumptions on uncertainty representation. Learning-based methods, including Bayesian Optimization, Contextual Bandits, and Reinforcement Learning, excel at integrating context and learning from interactions, particularly in dynamic or data-rich environments. Online and Adaptive Optimization emphasize sequential learning and real-time adaptation. The integration of ML predictions leverages data-driven insights, introducing challenges related to prediction error. Underlying these approaches are fundamental optimization techniques from machine learning, which provide the computational engine for training models and solving the resulting optimization problems. The selection of an appropriate method hinges on the specific characteristics of the problem, including the nature of uncertainty and context, the cost of obtaining information, and the required guarantees on solution quality and computational efficiency.​  

# 3.1 Robust Optimization  

Robust Optimization (RO) is a paradigm within optimization under uncertainty that aims to find solutions feasible for all possible realizations of the uncertain parameters within a defined uncertainty set [20,24]. The primary goal is to achieve solutions that are insensitive to the specific values taken by the uncertain parameters, ensuring performance guarantees under worst-case scenarios [20,24]. Unlike stochastic optimization—which relies on probability distributions—classical robust optimization typically focuses on guaranteeing feasibility and near-optimality for al parameter values within a given set, without necessarily requiring explicit knowledge of probability distributions.

A key element in robust optimization is the definition of the uncertainty set, represented as \​  

which encompasses all plausible values for the uncertain parameters. The shape and size of \(\mathcal{U}\) significantly influence the nature and conservatism of the robust solution [20,24]. Common types of uncertainty sets include box uncertainty—where each uncertain parameter is bounded independently within an interval; ellipsoidal uncertainty—which models parameter deviation relative to a nominal value using an ellipsoid; and polyhedral uncertainty—defined by a set of linear inequalities. Box uncertainty sets often lead to simpler robust counterparts but can be overly conservative, while ellipsoidal and polyhedral sets offer more flexibility in modeling dependencies and can yield less conservative, yet still protected, solutions. The selection of the uncertainty set is crucial, as it balances the need for robustness against potential over-conservatism, which might lead to poor performance under typical conditions.​  

Robust optimization approaches provide solutions that maintain feasibility for any realization of the uncertain parameters within the chosen set. This is often achieved by transforming the original uncertain problem into a deterministic “robust counterpart.” This counterpart typically involves optimizing over the worst-case scenario within the uncertainty set for each constraint. Formulations and solution techniques are developed to directly address these worst-case scenarios,  

ensuring that constraints remain satisfied and objectives are met to a guaranteed level, even under adversarial conditions within \(\mathcal{U}\) [20,24].  

Beyond classical robust optimization based purely on uncertainty sets, other approaches have emerged—such as distributionally robust optimization and adaptive robust optimization [20,24]. Distributionally robust optimization considers uncertainty not just in the parameter values but also in their underlying probability distributions, seeking solutions that perform well across a set of possible distributions. Adaptive robust optimization addresses multi-stage decision problems where decisions are made sequentially and future uncertainty is progressively revealed. It seeks policies (decision rules) that are robust to future uncertainty realizations, providing recourse actions at later stages. These different robust optimization techniques offer varying levels of protection and computational complexity; their applicability depends heavily on the specific characteristics of the uncertainty and the structure of the optimization problem. The focus remains on designing formulations and solution techniques that effectively handle potential constraint violations and performance degradation under uncertainty [24].  

# 3.2 Stochastic Programming  

Stochastic programming provides a powerful mathematical framework for optimizing decisions under uncertainty, particularly when the probability distributions of uncertain parameters are known or can be estimated. This methodology is distinct from deterministic optimization by explicitly incorporating random variables and their probabilistic nature into the model formulation. Central to stochastic programming are the concepts of two-stage and multi-stage models, which structure the decision-making process over time as uncertainty unfolds [11,20,24].  

![](images/e093f2893b32dd1cffbfb35733789ebd378585be6a7270e066a9523477883a8a.jpg)  

In a two-stage stochastic programming model, decisions are made sequentially. The first stage involves making a decision before the uncertain parameters are realized. After the uncertainty is revealed, second-stage decisions—often referred to as recourse actions—are taken to mitigate the consequences of the first-stage decision given the specific outcome of the uncertain variables [11,20,24]. This structure is particularly suitable for problems where immediate actions are required but subsequent adjustments are possible once more information is available [11]. Multi-stage stochastic programming extends this concept across multiple periods, allowing for a sequence of decisions as uncertainty is progressively revealed.​  

Uncertainty in stochastic programming is frequently modeled using a scenario-based approach [11,20,24]. This involves representing the potential future realizations of uncertain parameters as a discrete set of scenarios. Each scenario corresponds to a specific outcome for the uncertain variables and is associated with a probability reflecting its likelihood of occurrence. This approach directly incorporates probabilistic information into the optimization problem. The generation of these scenarios is a critical step, aiming to capture the full range and distribution of potential outcomes, although the specific techniques for scenario generation can vary [20,24].  

The objective in stochastic programming is typically to identify a set of first-stage decisions that minimizes the expected cost or maximizes the expected profit, taking into account the optimal recourse actions for all possible future scenarios. However, merely optimizing for the expected value may lead to solutions that are overly sensitive to extreme outcomes. Therefore, stochastic programming often incorporates various risk measures beyond expected value to address risk aversion [20,24]. Common risk measures include variance, which quantifies the dispersion of outcomes, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), which measures the expected loss conditional on losses exceeding a certain quantile. These measures enable decision-makers to balance expected performance with the need to mitigate potential downside risks.  

Solving stochastic programming problems can be computationally challenging, especially when the number of scenarios is large. Various approaches have been developed to address this complexity [11,20,24]. One common method is Sample Average Approximation (SAA), in which the expected value in the objective function is approximated by the average value computed over a sample of scenarios. Decomposition techniques are also widely employed, particularly for two-stage problems. For instance, Benders decomposition decomposes the problem into a master problem (handling first-stage decisions) and subproblems (handling second-stage recourse for each scenario), iteratively solving them to find the optimal solution [11,20,24]. Other techniques implicitly relate to global optimization packages capable of handling stochastic elements, though specific stochastic programming details are not provided [9]. The application of two-stage stochastic  

programming has proven effective in addressing real-world decision-making challenges across various domains, including urban logistics and scheduling [11].  

# 3.3 Bayesian Optimization with Context  

Contextual Bayesian optimization extends the principles of standard Bayesian optimization to settings where the objective function to be optimized depends on an additional context variable, in addition to the standard decision variables. This approach is explored to efficiently navigate the search space and locate optimal solutions under uncertainty, particularly when function evaluations are expensive or time-consuming [20,24]. The core idea is to employ a surrogate model, commonly a Gaussian process (GP), to approximate the underlying objective function, along with an acquisition function that guides the selection of subsequent evaluation points. To integrate contextual information, the GP model can be augmented. A common method involves utilizing context-dependent kernels within the Gaussian process framework, enabling the model to capture how the relationship between decision variables and the objective function evolves with varying context.​  

A significant advantage of Bayesian optimization, especially in contextual settings, is its efficiency in scenarios where evaluating the objective function is costly or time-consuming. By modeling the objective function and quantifying uncertainty through the surrogate model, Bayesian optimization can strategically select points that promise significant improvement or reduce uncertainty about the optimum, thereby minimizing the number of required function evaluations. This is crucial for real-world applications where experiments or simulations are expensive.  

The search process in contextual Bayesian optimization is driven by acquisition functions, which balance the trade-off between exploration (evaluating points in uncertain regions) and exploitation (evaluating points in regions expected to yield high objective values). Different acquisition functions embody this trade-off in various ways [20,24]. For example, Expected Improvement (EI) focuses on maximizing the expected improvement over the current best observed value, implicitly balancing exploration and exploitation. The Probability of Improvement (PI) strategy is more exploitative, targeting regions likely to improve upon the current best observation. In contrast, the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) approach explicitly balances this trade-off by considering both the predicted mean and the uncertainty (variance) of the surrogate model. The choice and design of the acquisition function, potentially made context-aware, profoundly impact the optimization trajectory and its ability to efficiently find the global optimum, particularly in complex, context-dependent landscapes.  

# 3.4 Multi-Armed Bandits and Contextual Bandits  

The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem serves as a foundational model for studying evaluative feedback and basic learning methods, acting as a simplified scenario within the broader domain of reinforcement learning [2]. In the standard MAB setting, an agent repeatedly chooses one action (or “arm”) from a set of options, receiving a reward based on the chosen arm. The core challenge lies in balancing exploration (trying different arms to discover their true reward distributions) and exploitation (selecting the arm currently believed to offer the highest reward) [1,20,24]. Effective navigation of this exploration–exploitation trade-off is crucial for maximizing cumulative rewards over time [24].​  

Traditional MAB algorithms, such as Epsilon-greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and Thompson Sampling, propose different strategies to address this trade-off [1,20,24]. The Epsilon-greedy approach balances exploration and exploitation by randomly choosing an arm a fraction $\epsilon$ of the time and selecting the arm with the highest estimated reward the remaining ${ \bf 1 } - \epsilon$ time [1]. UCB, on the other hand, prioritizes arms with high estimated rewards and those that have been tried less often by calculating a confidence bound for each arm and selecting the one with the highest bound. Specifically, the decision is made by selecting the arm with the largest upper confidence bound, often calculated as the sum of the mean reward and a bonus term related to uncertainty:​  

Upper Confidence Bound $\ b =$ Mean Reward $+$ Bonus  

This bonus decreases as an arm is played more, naturally promoting exploration [4]. Thompson Sampling employs a Bayesian approach by maintaining a probability distribution over the potential true reward for each arm and sampling from these distributions to make decisions. The frequency with which an arm is chosen is proportional to its probability of being the optimal arm [1]. While effective in many stationary environments, traditional MAB seeks a single optimal action across all instances [1].​

The limitations of traditional MAB in adapting to varying conditions led to the development of Contextual Bandits. Contextual bandits extend the MAB framework to an associative version where actions are taken in multiple, distinct situations or contexts [2]. Unlike traditional MAB, contextual bandits incorporate contextual information specific to the current instance (e.g., user attributes, time of day) to inform action selection, enabling personalized decision-making [1,20,24]. This allows the model to identify the best action for a specific user or situation based on their attributes, rather than seeking a single best action for everyone [1].  

In contextual bandits, the exploration–exploitation balance is refined by leveraging context. Algorithms learn a policy that maps contexts to actions. Similar principles from MAB, such as UCB and Thompson Sampling, are adapted to the contextual setting. For instance, LinUCB is a prominent contextual bandit algorithm that models the expected reward of an arm as a linear function of its context [2,4]. It estimates the parameters of this linear model for each arm and uses a UCB-like approach based on the uncertainty of these parameter estimates to guide exploration. The computational complexity of LinUCB scales linearly with the number of arms, making it suitable for scenarios with a large number of options and supporting dynamically changing candidate arm sets [4]. In general, contextual bandits utilize a learning period, balance exploration and exploitation based on context, and continuously adapt to personalize experiences [1].  

Analyzing the strengths and weaknesses, traditional MAB algorithms like Epsilon-greedy, UCB, and Thompson Sampling are computationally simple and effective in stationary, context-free environments. However, their weakness lies in their inability to adapt to varying user preferences or dynamic environments, as they lack a mechanism to incorporate contextual signals. Contextual bandit algorithms, such as LinUCB and contextual Thompson Sampling variants, overcome this limitation by incorporating context, leading to more personalized and potentially higher cumulative rewards in non-stationary or diverse settings [1]. Their strength is their adaptability and ability to learn context-dependent policies. However, their weakness is the increased computational complexity compared to traditional MAB, as they need to process context and potentially learn more complex models. The computational complexity and scalability of contextual bandit algorithms depend heavily on the chosen model for the context–reward relationship (e.g., linear models vs. non-linear models such as neural networks). While algorithms like LinUCB demonstrate linear scaling with the number of arms, complexity increases with the dimensionality of the context vector. Furthermore, a significant challenge in real-world applications is the acquisition, processing, and effective representation of relevant contextual data [24], which can be noisy, high-dimensional, or incomplete, potentially impacting performance and scalability. Performance guarantees for algorithms like LinUCB and Thompson Sampling in contextual settings often exist, typically in terms of regret bounds that quantify how much cumulative reward is lost compared to an optimal policy with full knowledge of reward distributions [2,24].  

In summary, contextual bandits offer a powerful advancement over traditional MAB by incorporating context for personalized decision-making, making them highly suitable for applications such as recommendation systems [4]. While they introduce computational complexities and challenges related to handling contextual data, algorithms like LinUCB provide efficient solutions with desirable properties such as linear scaling and adaptability to dynamic arm sets.  

# 3.5 Reinforcement Learning in Contextual Settings  

Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a powerful framework for sequential decision-making in uncertain environments, inherently relevant to contextual optimization problems. In this paradigm, an agent learns to select actions based on its current state or context to maximize a cumulative reward signal over time. The application of RL to contextual settings involves adapting standard RL algorithms to effectively utilize contextual information to inform decision policies.  

A simplified yet fundamental model within this domain is the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, which serves as an introduction to basic learning methods in RL [2]. Contextual bandits extend the basic MAB by allowing the reward distribution of each arm to depend on a context observed before the arm is pulled. This introduces the need for the agent to learn a policy that maps contexts to actions (arm pulls) to maximize expected reward, addressing a simpler form of contextual optimization compared to full sequential RL tasks.  

For more complex, sequential decision problems, stochastic modeling frameworks such as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are often employed, and RL serves as a primary solution methodology for finding optimal policies within these models [11]. In full RL settings, the agent's policy, which dictates action choices, or the value function, which estimates the expected future reward of states or state-action pairs, are conditioned on the observed context. This adaptation allows the agent to tailor its decisions to the specific situation at hand. Techniques for incorporating contextual information include policy gradient methods and deep RL algorithms that leverage neural networks to represent complex policies or value functions capable of processing high-dimensional contextual inputs [20,24]. Neural networks excel at feature extraction and function approximation, making deep RL particularly suitable for handling intricate and high-dimensional contextual spaces.  

Comparing different RL algorithms in the context of their application involves considering factors like sample efficiency, ability to handle high-dimensional contexts, and robustness to uncertainty. Model-free methods, such as Q-learning, learn directly from experience without explicitly modeling the environment dynamics [8]. While conceptually simple, basic modelfree approaches can suffer from low sample efficiency and struggle with large or continuous state/context spaces without function approximation. In contrast, deep RL methods employing neural networks can process high-dimensional contexts effectively but often require vast amounts of data for training, impacting sample efficiency [20,24]. Model-based approaches, although not explicitly detailed in the provided digests beyond a comparison point [8], can potentially achieve higher sample efficiency by utilizing a learned or predefined model of the environment, but their performance relies heavily on the accuracy of the model, which can be challenging to obtain in complex or highly uncertain environments.  

Robustness to uncertainty in contextual RL is addressed through various mechanisms, including effective explorationexploitation strategies and algorithms designed to quantify and manage uncertainty in predictions. Exploration strategies are crucial for discovering optimal actions across different contexts, and these strategies are modified in contextual RL to ensure sufficient data collection across the contextual space [20,24]. Specific applications demonstrate the practical use of DRL in contextual control problems. For instance, the UMGT scheme employs two DRL algorithms to make decisions regarding data generation, packet adjustments, and retransmissions in a wireless network context to minimize the average Uncertainty of Information (UoI) [16]. This exemplifies how DRL can directly optimize system performance metrics conditioned on the current operational context.​  

# 3.6 Online Learning and Adaptive Optimization  

Online learning represents a paradigm where algorithms learn from data sequentially, adapting their decisions or models over time based on real-time feedback [4,20,24]. This sequential nature contrasts with batch learning, where the entire dataset is available beforehand. A fundamental challenge in online learning, particularly in decision-making contexts like recommendation systems or resource allocation, is the exploration–exploitation trade-off. This involves balancing the need to explore new options to discover potentially better outcomes against exploiting currently known optimal strategies to maximize immediate rewards.​  

Various online learning and adaptive optimization algorithms have been developed to address these challenges. Contextual bandit algorithms, for instance, are noted as online learning schemes that update their models in real time [4]. They are particularly effective in scenarios requiring dynamic decision-making with limited information, such as online advertising or content recommendation. Compared to traditional methods like A/B testing, which commits to a strategy for a fixed period before evaluation, bandit algorithms can converge to the optimal strategy more quickly by continuously learning and adapting based on incoming data [4]. Reinforcement learning is another broad class of algorithms falling under the umbrella of online and adaptive optimization, focusing on learning optimal actions through trial and error in dynamic environments [20,24]. These methods learn policies that map states to actions, aiming to maximize cumulative reward over time.​  

Meta-learning, or “learning to learn,” offers an approach to accelerate learning in new, unseen environments [20,24]. By leveraging experiences from a distribution of related tasks, a meta-learning model can quickly adapt to a new task with minimal data, making it particularly relevant for scenarios where environments change or new tasks are frequently encountered.​  

Beyond decision-making policies, adaptive optimization also encompasses methods for efficiently training machine learning models, particularly in deep learning. Adaptive gradient methods like RMSprop and Adam adjust learning rates for each parameter based on the history of gradients [19]. RMSprop utilizes an exponentially weighted moving average of squared gradients to scale the learning rate, effectively addressing issues related to learning rate decay [19]. Its update rules are defined as:  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { \displaystyle v _ { t } = \beta v _ { t - 1 } + ( 1 - \beta ) \nabla J ( \theta ) ^ { 2 } } } \\ { { \displaystyle \theta ^ { ( t + 1 ) } = \theta ^ { ( t ) } - \frac { \alpha } { \sqrt { v _ { t } + \epsilon } } \nabla J ( \theta ) } } \end{array}
$$  

Adam combines the concepts of Momentum and RMSprop, maintaining both an exponentially weighted average of past gradients $( \mathsf { m } _ { - } \mathtt { t } )$ and squared gradients $( \mathsf { v } _ { - } \mathtt { t } )$ [19]. This makes Adam well-suited for optimizing deep learning models, handling sparse gradients and non-convex optimization problems effectively [19]. The update rules for Adam are:  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { m _ { t } = \beta _ { 1 } m _ { t - 1 } + ( 1 - \beta _ { 1 } ) \nabla J ( \theta ) } \\ & { v _ { t } = \beta _ { 2 } v _ { t - 1 } + ( 1 - \beta _ { 2 } ) \nabla J ( \theta ) ^ { 2 } } \\ & { \theta ^ { ( t + 1 ) } = \theta ^ { ( t ) } - \cfrac { \alpha } { \sqrt { v _ { t } } + \epsilon } m _ { t } } \end{array}
$$  

While powerful, Adam can sometimes exhibit poor generalization compared to methods with fixed learning rates in certain contexts [19].  

Adaptive optimization strategies are crucial for dynamic systems requiring efficient resource allocation and robust performance. Examples include adaptive optimization-based dynamic networking strategies employed in complex communication scenarios like satellite-to-ground, high-speed mobile node, and deep space networks, where real-time adaptation to changing conditions is essential for maintaining reliable transmission and efficient resource utilization [16].  

# 3.7 Optimization with Predictions  

Integrating machine learning model predictions into optimization problems is a growing area, enabling decision-making processes to leverage insights derived from data. This approach typically involves using predictions—such as estimated demands, expected outcomes, or predicted system states—as input parameters for mathematical optimization models. For instance, recurrent neural networks like LSTMs have been employed to predict sequential information (e.g., human actions based on historical behavior) [12]. These predicted actions can subsequently inform or directly serve as inputs to downstream optimization or decision-making frameworks [12].  

A significant challenge in this paradigm is effectively handling prediction errors. Machine learning models inherently produce predictions with varying degrees of uncertainty and inaccuracy. These errors can propagate through the optimization problem, potentially leading to suboptimal or invalid solutions. The impact of prediction errors on solution quality is a critical concern, necessitating robust methods to mitigate their effects; although the specific techniques for error handling are diverse and context-dependent.  

In scenarios where the objective function or its gradients are unavailable or computationally expensive to obtain—such as in black-box systems or complex solver-in-the-loop problems—zero-order optimization (ZOO) techniques become particularly relevant [3]. ZOO methods do not require explicit gradient information, instead relying on function evaluations to estimate the gradient or direction of improvement. This makes them suitable for optimizing systems where the relationship between inputs and outputs is mediated by a complex, potentially unmodellable process or another optimization solver.  

Prominent ZOO methods include gradient estimation techniques. Coordinate Gradient Estimation (CGE) approximates the gradient by evaluating the function along individual coordinate axes. The formula for CGE is given by:​  

$$
{ \hat { \nabla } } _ { i } f ( x ) \approx { \frac { f ( x + h e _ { i } ) - f ( x - h e _ { i } ) } { 2 h } }
$$  

where $\backslash ( \mathsf { e \_ i } )$ is the standard basis vector for the $\langle ( \mathsf { i } \backslash )$ th dimension and $\left\backslash ( \mathsf { h } \backslash ) \right.$ is a small step size [3].  

Random Gradient Estimation (RGE), on the other hand, estimates the gradient using random perturbation vectors. The RGE formula is:  

$$
{ \hat { \nabla } } f ( x ) \approx { \frac { f ( x + h q ) - f ( x ) } { h } } q
$$  

where $\left. ( { \mathsf { q } } { \mathsf { \backslash } } ) \right.$ is a random vector and $\left\backslash ( \mathsf { h } \backslash ) \right.$ is the step size [3].  

These zeroth-order techniques are valuable for navigating optimization landscapes derived from or interacting with systems where gradient information is inaccessible, complementing the use of predictions in complex optimization settings [3]. Such approaches are crucial in applications like developing black-box defenses against adversarial attacks or optimizing parameters within iterative solver processes [3].​  

# 3.8 Relevant Optimization Methods from Machine Learning  

Optimization algorithms play a fundamental role in machine learning by serving as the engine for training models. The process typically involves defining a model representation, formulating an objective function (often a cost or loss function) that quantifies the discrepancy between model predictions and actual data, and then employing an optimization algorithm to minimize this function [6,18,19]. The minimum of the cost function corresponds to a set of model parameters that ideally minimize error on the training data [6]. The interplay between model complexity, the choice of optimization method, and the evaluation metric determines the final performance of the learned model [18]. This section surveys various optimization techniques commonly used in machine learning.  

A cornerstone of optimization in machine learning is Gradient Descent (GD). This iterative first-order optimization algorithm updates model parameters in the direction opposite to the gradient of the loss function [18,19]. The update rule for GD is given by:​  

$$
{ \boldsymbol { x } } _ { t + 1 } = { \boldsymbol { x } } _ { t } - \eta \nabla f ( { \boldsymbol { x } } _ { t } )
$$  

where $\scriptstyle { \boldsymbol { x } } _ { t }$ ​ represents the parameters at iteration $\textit { t , } \eta$ is the learning rate, and $\nabla f ( { \boldsymbol { x } } _ { t } )$ is the gradient of the objective function $f$ at $\mathbf { \Psi } _ { \mathbf { { \mathcal { X } } } _ { t } }$ ​ [18]. Equivalently, using $\theta$ for parameters and $J$ for the loss function, the update is  

$$
\boldsymbol { \theta } ^ { ( t + 1 ) } = \boldsymbol { \theta } ^ { ( t ) } - \alpha \nabla J ( \boldsymbol { \theta } )
$$  

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate [19].  

Basic GD computes the gradient over the entire dataset, which can be computationally expensive for large datasets. To address this, variants like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Mini-Batch Gradient Descent were developed [19]. SGD computes the gradient using a single randomly sampled data point, making each update much faster and suitable for largescale and online learning scenarios [18,19]. However, SGD updates are noisy and can be unstable due to the high variance of the gradient estimate [19]. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent strikes a balance by computing the gradient on a small subset (batch) of the data, reducing gradient noise compared to SGD while still being more computationally efficient than full GD [19].  

Techniques like Momentum can be incorporated to accelerate convergence and reduce oscillations by combining the current gradient update with a fraction of the previous updates [19]. The update rules for Momentum are  

$$
v _ { t } = \beta v _ { t - 1 } + ( 1 - \beta ) \nabla J ( \theta )
$$  

and  

$$
\boldsymbol { \theta } ^ { ( t + 1 ) } = \boldsymbol { \theta } ^ { ( t ) } - \alpha \boldsymbol { v } _ { t }
$$  

where $\boldsymbol { v } _ { t }$ ​ is the velocity term and $\beta$ is the momentum coefficient [19].  

More advanced variants include adaptive learning rate methods like AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam, which adjust the learning rate based on the historical gradients [20,24]. For instance, the Adam optimizer has been successfully used to train complex models like LSTM networks [12].  

Beyond basic first-order methods, several advanced optimization techniques are relevant to machine learning, offering potential advantages in convergence speed or handling specific problem structures [18]. Quasi-Newton methods, such as BFGS and its limited-memory variant L-BFGS, approximate the Hessian matrix (the matrix of second partial derivatives) using only gradient information [9,18]. This approximation helps capture curvature information of the objective function, potentially leading to faster convergence than first-order methods, without incurring the high computational cost of computing the exact Hessian [18]. The update rule for Quasi-Newton methods is  

$$
x _ { k + 1 } = x _ { k } - B _ { k } ^ { - 1 } \nabla f ( x _ { k } )
$$  

where $B _ { k }$ ​ is the approximation of the Hessian [18]. For large-scale machine learning, stochastic variants of quasi-Newton methods have been developed, aiming to combine the benefits of stochasticity for large datasets with the improved convergence of second-order information [15]. These methods require algorithmic improvements to work efficiently in various scenarios [15].​  

Other advanced techniques include Conjugate Gradient, which selects a sequence of linearly independent directions to find the optimal solution, improving upon the slow convergence of gradient descent [18]. Its search direction is computed as  

$$
p _ { k } = - g _ { k } + \beta _ { k } p _ { k - 1 } \quad \mathrm { w i t h } \quad \beta _ { k } = \frac { g _ { k } ^ { T } g _ { k } } { g _ { k - 1 } ^ { T } g _ { k - 1 } } ,
$$  

and the update is  

$$
x _ { k + 1 } = x _ { k } + \alpha _ { k } p _ { k }
$$  

[18]. Proximal Gradient Descent is used when the objective function has a non-differentiable component, incorporating a proximal mapping step defined as  

$$
\mathrm { p r o x } _ { h } ( x ) = \arg \operatorname* { m i n } _ { u } \Bigl \{ h ( u ) + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \| u - x \| _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } \Bigr \}
$$  

[18]. Projected Gradient Descent handles constrained optimization by projecting the parameter updates onto the feasible set [18]. The Penalty Function Method converts constrained problems into unconstrained ones by adding a term to the objective function that penalizes constraint violations [18]. The Frank-Wolfe algorithm linearizes the objective function to find feasible descent directions [18] and has been adapted for challenging problems like multi-objective optimization in deep learning by developing a Frank-Wolfe-based optimizer for a modified Multi-Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) [7]. Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) decomposes problems into smaller, easier-to-solve subproblems [18]. Coordinate Descent optimizes variables one or a subset at a time while keeping others fixed [18]. In the realm of zerothorder optimization, where gradients are unavailable, techniques like Coordinate Gradient Estimation (CGE) and Random Gradient Estimation (RGE) are used. CGE has shown superior accuracy and efficiency compared to RGE for tasks like training CNNs [3].​  

Specific frameworks are designed for particular types of optimization problems arising in machine learning. For solving convex quadratic programs (CQP), an infeasible-start framework can be applied to interior-point algorithms [5]. This framework enables the algorithm to start from an infeasible point, making it potentially more robust. Within a feasible-start, constraint-reduced interior-point method for CQP, computational efficiency, especially on imbalanced problems, is enhanced by solving an approximate Newton-KKT system for search directions through "constraint reduction" [5]. This approximation involves selecting a subset of constraints to estimate the active set and using an adaptive positive definite regularization of the Hessian [5]. The affine-scaling search direction $( \Delta x , \Delta \lambda _ { Q } , \Delta s _ { Q } )$ is obtained by solving:​  

$$
\left( \begin{array} { c c c } { H + W } & { A _ { Q } ^ { T } } & { 0 } \\ { A _ { Q } } & { 0 } & { - I } \\ { 0 } & { S _ { Q } } & { \Lambda _ { Q } } \end{array} \right) \left( \begin{array} { c } { \Delta x } \\ { \Delta \lambda _ { Q } } \\ { \Delta s _ { Q } } \end{array} \right) = \left( \begin{array} { c } { - \nabla f ( x ) - A _ { Q } ^ { T } \lambda _ { Q } } \\ { b _ { Q } - A _ { Q } x - s _ { Q } } \\ { \mu _ { ( Q ) } e - S _ { Q } \lambda _ { Q } } \end{array} \right) ,
$$  

and the corrector direction is computed by solving a similar system with modified right-hand side terms [5]. This approach demonstrates how specialized optimization frameworks are developed to tackle specific problem structures encountered in machine learning applications.  

# 4. Applications and Case Studies  

Contextual optimization under uncertainty is a rapidly evolving field with broad applicability across numerous domains, where decision-making must account for dynamic environments, partial information, and unpredictable factors. This section surveys key application areas, highlighting the domain-specific challenges related to context and uncertainty, the contextual optimization techniques employed, and the benefits achieved [4,11,13,16,19].

In Recommender Systems, contextual bandit algorithms are utilized to address the challenges of dynamic user preferences, item cold-start problems, and the exploration-exploitation trade-off inherent in providing personalized recommendations [4,20]. By incorporating context such as user history and item features, these methods enable online learning and continuous adaptation, although challenges remain in scaling to high-dimensional spaces and ensuring efficient model updates.  

Wireless Networks and Resource Allocation leverage contextual optimization to manage highly dynamic conditions including time-varying channels, fluctuating demands, and changing topologies [16,20]. Applications range from satellite communication to IoT and 6G networks [16,21]. Contextual approaches, often facing exploration-exploitation trade-offs, adapt resource allocation (bandwidth, power, time slots) based on real-time context like channel quality and traffic load, crucial for maintaining performance under significant variability [20].  

Urban Logistics and Retail, particularly within omnichannel frameworks, face challenges from dynamic demand and complex supply chains [11]. Context is derived from detailed order data, while uncertainty lies in demand forecasting [20]. Contextual optimization, using uncertainty modeling and detailed data parameters, aims to improve predictive accuracy and inform prescriptive analytics for better resource allocation, inventory management, and scheduling [20].  

Scheduling Problems, such as staff or hospital operating room scheduling, require managing dynamic conditions and unpredictable events [11,20]. Context includes specific constraints (patient characteristics, staff, equipment), and uncertainty stems from events like emergencies or variable durations [20]. Solutions often involve stochastic modeling, robust optimization, or scenario planning to create resilient schedules that improve resource utilization and outcomes under uncertainty [20].​  

In Financial Markets and Risk Management, machine learning optimization methods are applied to quantitative trading, credit scoring, portfolio optimization, and insurance pricing [19]. Contextual information like market trends, news, and regulations is vital [14]. Uncertainty management relies on techniques such as robust optimization and stochastic programming to build strategies resilient to market volatility and adverse events [19]. Challenges include data quality, regulatory constraints, and model interpretability.​  

Healthcare addresses patient heterogeneity and treatment uncertainty through contextual optimization for personalized medicine and resource allocation [10,20]. Context includes patient characteristics and medical history [10]. Uncertainty in outcomes drives the use of statistical and stochastic modeling [17]. Applications like pooled testing during pandemics demonstrate significant efficiency and sensitivity gains by leveraging context and heterogeneity [17]. Operating room scheduling is another example where stochastic modeling enhances robustness [11].  

Robotics and Autonomous Systems operate in complex, uncertain environments, utilizing contextual information (sensor data, maps, other agents' state) for navigation, planning, and control [16,20,21]. Uncertainty sources include sensor noise and dynamic obstacles [20]. Contextual optimization and distributed coordination techniques, sometimes informed by principles from reinforcement learning, are employed to handle these dynamics and improve reliability in tasks ranging from multi-robot coordination to vehicular platooning [16,21].  

Smart Grids and Energy Management require contextual information (weather, prices, grid conditions) to optimize operations like demand response and renewable integration [21]. Uncertainty stems from variable generation and unpredictable demand. Robust optimization and stochastic programming are fundamental for developing resilient strategies, such as robust dynamic economic dispatch and distributed power allocation, crucial for maintaining stability and efficiency [21].​  

Power Grid Stability Prediction, especially with renewable integration, utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the grid's complex structure and predict stability [13]. Context is captured by the grid graph and node attributes. While facing model architecture variability, GNNs demonstrate predictability and transferability across grid sizes, offering an alternative to traditional methods for handling the high-dimensional dynamics and uncertainty [13].  

Human Decision-Making prediction employs computational models like RNNs (LSTMs) and Bayesian models to understand choices in tasks like the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and Iowa Gambling Task [12,20]. Context includes interaction history and learned experiences, while uncertainty relates to unpredictable behavior. LSTMs capture sequential dependencies, and Bayesian models (e.g., theory of mind models) explicitly model cognitive processes and probabilistic reasoning [8,12].  

Finally, Knowledge Tracing uses graph-based models like the Deep Graph Memory Network (DGMN) to assess student understanding [13]. Context involves relationships among concepts and learning history, and uncertainty includes knowledge acquisition and decay. DGMN explicitly models concept relationships and forgetting, showing superior performance on benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art models by leveraging dynamic concept graphs and attentionbased forgetting mechanisms [13].  

Comparing the effectiveness across these diverse domains is challenging due to domain-specific metrics and problem formulations. However, a common thread is the necessity of integrating relevant contextual information and explicitly addressing uncertainty through appropriate optimization frameworks to achieve performance gains over methods that ignore these factors. While contextual bandits excel in dynamic, sequential decision problems with explicit exploration needs (Recommender Systems, Wireless Networks), robust optimization and stochastic programming are prevalent where resilience to worst-case or probabilistic uncertainty is paramount (Finance, Healthcare, Smart Grids, Scheduling). Machine learning models like GNNs, RNNs, and Bayesian methods demonstrate power in domains where context and uncertainty are deeply intertwined with complex system dynamics or human behavior (Power Grids, Human Decision-Making, Knowledge Tracing, Robotics). The specific performance improvements are highly context-dependent, ranging from mitigating coldstart issues and improving resource utilization to enhancing predictive accuracy and system resilience [4,11,13,16,19]. Crossdomain comparisons often reveal trade-offs between model complexity, interpretability, data requirements, and computational efficiency, suggesting that the most effective approach is dictated by the specific characteristics and constraints of the application domain.​  

# 4.1 Recommender Systems  

Contextual bandit algorithms represent a powerful paradigm for personalizing recommendations by explicitly considering user context and item features [4]. This approach allows recommendation systems to adapt dynamically to changing user preferences and environmental conditions, moving beyond static models.  

A significant advantage of applying contextual bandits in this domain is their ability to effectively address several key challenges inherent in recommender systems [4,20]. Notably, these algorithms are well-suited to mitigate the cold-start problem, which arises when introducing new items or encountering new users with limited interaction history. By intelligently incorporating exploration mechanisms, contextual bandits can actively allocate traffic towards novel items, thereby gathering data on their performance and user interactions more rapidly than traditional methods [4].  

Furthermore, contextual bandits help manage data cycle issues by maintaining a balance between exploring new options and exploiting known good recommendations, addressing the fundamental exploration-exploitation trade-off [4,20]. The inherent structure of contextual bandit models, which learn policies mapping contexts to actions (recommendations) based on observed rewards (user feedback), makes them particularly effective for online learning and continuous adaptation in dynamic recommendation environments.  

Implementing these algorithms in large-scale recommender systems involves challenges related to managing highdimensional context and action spaces, efficient model updating with streaming data, and ensuring computational scalability to handle millions of users and items. However, their capability to integrate context and handle uncertainty makes them a promising direction for improving recommendation quality and relevance.​  

# 4.2 Wireless Networks and Resource Allocation  

Contextual optimization plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance and efficiency of wireless networks, particularly in the domain of resource allocation [20]. These networks operate under inherently uncertain and dynamic conditions, including time-varying channel states, fluctuating user demands, and changing network topologies [16]. Contextual optimization methods are leveraged to address these challenges by enabling intelligent decision-making that adapts to the observed context [20].​  

Applications of contextual optimization in wireless environments span diverse scenarios, such as satellite-integrated internet, satellite-to-ground communication networks, high-speed mobile node communication, and deep space networks [16]. In these contexts, optimizing resource allocation and ensuring robust transmission performance are critical, especially under the challenges posed by high dynamics, multipath propagation effects, and non-line-of-sight transmission in complex environments [16]. Furthermore, contextual optimization is explored for minimizing energy consumption in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, potentially assisted by technologies like NOMA-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) [16]. The principles are also relevant to emerging areas like 6G communications, including resource allocation in networks assisted by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and energy cooperation strategies in multi-cell wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs) [21].​  

The effectiveness of contextual optimization algorithms in wireless networks stems from their ability to adapt to the system's state. By considering the current context—which might include channel quality indicators, user locations, traffic load, and device energy levels—the algorithms can make informed decisions about allocating resources such as bandwidth, power, and time slots [20]. This adaptive capability is essential for maintaining performance in environments characterized by significant variability over time [16].​  

A fundamental challenge when applying contextual bandit algorithms for dynamic resource allocation in wireless networks is managing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Exploration involves trying different resource allocation  

strategies to gather more information about their performance under various contexts, which helps improve the model's understanding of the environment [16]. Exploitation, conversely, involves using the current best-known strategy based on past experience to maximize immediate performance, such as throughput or energy efficiency [20]. In highly dynamic wireless scenarios, a purely exploitative approach risks selecting sub-optimal strategies as the environment changes, while excessive exploration can lead to a significant loss in performance during the learning phase. Therefore, algorithms must balance exploring new allocation possibilities to adapt to evolving conditions (time-varying channels, user demands) with exploiting the knowledge gained so far to achieve near-optimal performance in the current context [16]. Effectively navigating this trade-off is key to developing resource allocation schemes that are both performant and robust against uncertainty in wireless communication systems [20].  

# 4.3 Urban Logistics and Retail  

Urban logistics and retail environments present complex scenarios for contextual optimization under uncertainty, driven by dynamic consumer demand, diverse delivery requirements, and intricate supply chains. One key application area lies within omnichannel retailing, which integrates various sales channels to provide a unified customer experience [11].  

Within this domain, uncertainty modeling is critical, particularly in systems managing orders and facilitating demand fulfillment [20]. Order management systems collect extensive data—including when orders are placed, requested delivery dates, and the specific products and quantities demanded [20]—and this detailed information, originating typically from sales functions, is subsequently transferred to production and operations departments responsible for demand fulfillment [20].​  

In these applications, context is fundamentally captured by the granular data from the order management system, detailing the specific circumstances of each transaction and demand signal [20]. Uncertainty primarily manifests in predicting future demand based on this historical and current data, a task performed by managers in operations [20]. A significant challenge arises from information loss that often occurs during data aggregation, which can diminish the accuracy of subsequent prescriptive analytics [20].  

To address this, uncertainty modeling involves identifying and applying key parameters derived from the order management system [20]. This process aims to restore crucial information lost during aggregation, thereby enhancing the data used for prescriptive analytics [20]. By leveraging these detailed parameters, managers can improve the fidelity of their predictive models and inform operational decisions more effectively.​  

The impact of these contextual optimization and uncertainty modeling approaches lies in their potential to significantly enhance operational efficiency. By providing more accurate demand predictions and more informed inputs for prescriptive analytics, these methods enable better resource allocation, improved inventory management, and more responsive scheduling in demand fulfillment processes [20]. This ultimately leads to streamlined operations and potentially reduced costs within the complex landscape of urban logistics and retail.  

# 4.4 Scheduling  

Scheduling problems represent a critical domain where contextual optimization under uncertainty plays a significant role, impacting both operational efficiency and outcome quality. Examples include staff scheduling in complex environments such as manufacturing facilities or hospitals, and hospital operating room scheduling [11]. In these applications, effective scheduling requires accounting for dynamic conditions and unpredictable events [20].​  

Context in these scheduling scenarios is typically modeled by incorporating factors that describe the specific circumstances surrounding the optimization problem. For instance, in hospital operating room scheduling, context can encompass patient characteristics, staff availability, and equipment constraints. Uncertainty arises from unpredictable events—such as emergency cases requiring immediate attention or variability in procedure durations [20]. Modeling this uncertainty might involve probabilistic distributions, robust optimization techniques, or scenario planning to capture the potential range of these unpredictable factors.  

Applying contextual optimization under uncertainty in scheduling aims to produce plans that are not only efficient under expected conditions but also resilient to disruptions. The impact of these approaches is analyzed in terms of improved resource utilization (for example, by minimizing idle times for operating rooms or ensuring appropriate staff allocation) and enhanced outcomes (such as reduced patient waiting times or improved service levels) [20]. By explicitly considering both context and uncertainty, these methods allow for proactive adjustments and more robust decision-making compared to deterministic or simpler stochastic models.  

# 4.5 Financial Markets and Risk Management  

The application of machine learning optimization has become increasingly vital in financial risk management, addressing a variety of complex problems and enhancing decision‐making processes under uncertainty. A primary area of application is quantitative trading, where optimization is employed to maximize objective functions such as the Sharpe Ratio or minimize volatility. This typically involves using gradient descent methods to fine‐tune trading strategy parameters [19].  

Beyond trading, machine learning optimization is extensively used in developing credit scoring models. Here, the goal is to optimize parameters for models like Logistic Regression or Neural Networks using algorithms such as Adam, SGD, and RMSprop, aiming to improve the accuracy of assessing creditworthiness [19].  

Portfolio optimization constitutes another significant application, focusing on optimizing asset weights within a portfolio to achieve objectives like maximizing investment returns while simultaneously minimizing risk. Standard approaches include Mean–Variance Optimization (MVO) and Convex Optimization. Furthermore, non‐convex optimization methods, such as Genetic Algorithms, are also utilized, particularly for more complex portfolio structures [19].  

In the insurance sector, machine learning optimization is applied to refine insurance pricing models. This involves optimizing parameters by maximizing the Log–Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to ensure a reasonable evaluation of insurance risk and determine appropriate premiums [19].  

Contextual information plays a critical role in improving financial decision‐making within these optimization frameworks. Factors such as prevailing market trends, significant news events, and shifts in investor sentiment can provide crucial signals for adjusting strategies and models [14]. For instance, market feedback, like stock price reactions to corporate announcements, can prompt companies to reassess their decisions, illustrating a direct feedback loop [14]. Regulatory contexts, such as the SEC's focus on insider trading and pre‐trade plans, also represent important contextual constraints and information that must be integrated into models and decisions to ensure compliance and manage regulatory risk [14].  

Despite the potential benefits, applying machine learning optimization in finance faces significant challenges. Data quality is paramount, as financial data can be noisy, incomplete, and subject to structural changes. Regulatory constraints impose strict requirements on financial models, demanding transparency, stability, and compliance, which can conflict with the complexity of some advanced optimization techniques. Model interpretability is also a major concern, particularly in highly regulated environments, as stakeholders and regulators often require clear explanations for model outputs and decisions. Opportunities lie in developing more robust and interpretable models that can effectively handle the dynamic and regulated nature of financial markets.​  

To effectively manage the inherent uncertainties in financial markets, techniques like robust optimization and stochastic programming are indispensable. Robust optimization focuses on finding solutions that perform well under the worst‐case scenarios within a defined set of uncertainty. This approach is particularly valuable in finance for constructing portfolios or trading strategies that are resilient to adverse market movements. Stochastic programming, on the other hand, models uncertainty using probability distributions and seeks to optimize expected performance while potentially considering recourse actions as uncertainty unfolds. These methods provide rigorous frameworks for incorporating different sources of uncertainty, such as price volatility, interest rate fluctuations, and credit events, into the optimization process, thereby enhancing risk management capabilities.​  

# 4.6 Healthcare  

Contextual optimization plays a critical role in healthcare by enabling personalized decisions and optimizing resource allocation under significant uncertainty. A central challenge in this domain is managing patient heterogeneity, treatment uncertainty, and limited resources effectively [20]. Personalized medicine, for instance, necessitates administering different treatment courses tailored to individual patients, taking into account crucial contextual information such as genomic type and medical history [10]. Utilizing patient characteristics and historical treatment outcomes allows for a more precise understanding of potential responses and risks, forming the basis for personalized care.  

The inherent uncertainty in treatment outcomes and patient responses underscores the need for robust optimization methodologies. Stochastic programming offers a powerful framework for optimizing treatment plans under uncertainty by modeling future scenarios and optimizing decisions across possible outcomes. While specific applications of stochastic  

programming for individual treatment plans were not detailed in the provided digests, the broader application of stochastic modeling and optimization under uncertainty is evident in related healthcare problems.  

For example, optimizing pooled testing strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic represents a key application of contextual optimization in healthcare [17]. This involves incorporating contextual information, such as the relationships between individuals being tested (e.g., housemates, coworkers) and variations in infection risk across time, place, and individuals, to improve testing efficiency and sensitivity [17]. By exploiting natural correlations between samples and accounting for heterogeneity across pools through statistical modeling, studies have shown significant gains in sensitivity (up to $3 0 \%$ ) and efficiency (up to $9 0 \%$ ) [17]. This demonstrates how leveraging context and understanding heterogeneity can lead to substantially better resource utilization and diagnostic accuracy in the face of epidemiological uncertainty.  

Another area benefiting from optimization under uncertainty is hospital resource management, such as operating room scheduling [11]. Scheduling medical facilities and personnel involves balancing patient demand, resource availability, and unforeseen events (e.g., emergency surgeries, procedure duration variability), where stochastic modeling can help create robust and efficient schedules.​  

In summary, contextual optimization in healthcare addresses complex problems involving patient heterogeneity, treatment uncertainty, and resource constraints. By incorporating rich contextual information like patient characteristics, historical data, and environmental factors, and employing methodologies such as statistical and stochastic modeling, healthcare systems can move towards more personalized treatment strategies, optimized diagnostic protocols, and efficient resource allocation [10,11,17,20].  

# 4.7 Robotics and Autonomous Systems  

Robotics and autonomous systems frequently operate in complex and uncertain environments, necessitating the effective utilization of contextual information to achieve robust performance. Contextual information, encompassing sensor data, environmental conditions, maps, and the state of other agents, is crucial for improving capabilities such as navigation, motion planning, and control [20]. By incorporating contextual data, robots can better perceive their surroundings, predict outcomes, and make informed decisions, particularly when faced with inherent uncertainties like sensor noise, dynamic obstacles, and unpredictable environmental changes [20]. Contextual optimization approaches are specifically employed in these domains to handle these sources of uncertainty and enhance the reliability and efficiency of robotic operations [20].​  

The application of contextual information extends to the coordination of multi-robot and multi-agent systems, which is vital for collaborative tasks in diverse settings [16,21]. Distributed coordination strategies often leverage contextual data about the state of other agents, shared resources, and task requirements. For instance, mechanisms like the winner-take-all (WTA) are applied in multi-robot systems for tasks such as task allocation, resource distribution, path planning, and decentralized decision-making, all of which rely on timely and relevant contextual information [16]. Research in multi-agent systems includes applications like formation tracking for multi-UAV systems and cooperative pointing control, which inherently depend on maintaining awareness of relative positions and states—a form of contextual understanding [21]. Similarly, control strategies for vehicular platooning demonstrate the importance of contextual information exchange between vehicles to maintain formation and safety [21].​  

Beyond explicit optimization methods, reinforcement learning (RL) represents another paradigm for training robots to execute complex tasks within uncertain environments. RL allows robots to learn optimal policies through trial and error by interacting with their environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. This learning process implicitly leverages contextual information derived from observations to adapt behaviors and improve performance over time, particularly in scenarios where explicit modeling of all uncertainties is challenging. While the provided materials primarily detail applications of contextual optimization and multi-robot coordination strategies utilizing contextual data [16,20,21], reinforcement learning remains a significant technique in the field for enabling robots to acquire complex skills and make robust decisions under uncertainty by learning from contextual experiences.  

# 4.8 Smart Grids and Energy Management  

The optimization of operations within smart grids necessitates the effective integration of contextual information to inform energy management decisions. Factors such as weather forecasts, fluctuating energy prices, and dynamic grid conditions serve as crucial contextual inputs for optimizing processes like demand response, renewable energy integration, and overall grid control. Contextual optimization is instrumental in addressing the inherent challenges of managing variable demand, intermittent renewable energy sources, and potential grid failures [21].  

By leveraging real-time or predicted contextual data, energy management systems can make more informed decisions regarding resource allocation, scheduling, and control actions to enhance efficiency and reliability.  

A primary challenge in smart grid management is the presence of significant uncertainties stemming from variable generation (e.g., solar and wind power) and unpredictable demand. To ensure grid stability and resilience under these uncertain conditions, advanced optimization techniques are employed. Robust optimization and stochastic programming provide frameworks for developing strategies that are resilient to worst-case scenarios or statistically probable variations in uncertain parameters. For instance, robust dynamic economic dispatch is a critical area where intelligent learning technologies are utilized to handle uncertainties in grid operations, ensuring reliable and cost-effective power allocation over time [21].​  

Furthermore, distributed optimization algorithms are explored for applications like power allocation among micro-grids, enabling decentralized decision-making that can adapt to local conditions and uncertainties [21].  

Research also focuses on resilience-oriented operation strategies for integrated energy systems, such as combined electricity and natural gas networks, leveraging contextual information and robust approaches to maintain functionality and recover quickly from disruptions [21].  

These applications highlight how sophisticated optimization techniques, informed by context and designed for uncertainty are fundamental to achieving stable, efficient, and resilient smart grids.  

# 4.9 Power Grid Stability Prediction (using GNNs)  

Ensuring the dynamic stability of power grids is a critical challenge, particularly with the growing integration of renewable energy sources, which introduce factors like decentralization, reduced inertia, and volatility. Addressing this challenge, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach due to their inherent capability to model complex systems with underlying graph structures, such as power grids [13].  

Research exploring the application of GNNs for power grid stability prediction investigates their ability to capture the intricate relationships between grid components. One study leveraged GNNs to predict the Single-Node Basin Stability (SNBS), a measure indicative of grid stability [13]. The approach involved generating synthetic datasets for grids of varying sizes (specifically, 20 and 100 nodes) and estimating SNBS through Monte Carlo sampling. GNN models were then applied in a nodal-regression setup, utilizing the full grid graph as input to predict the SNBS for individual nodes [13]. By processing the grid's topology and node attributes encoded within the graph structure, GNNs can learn the dependencies and interactions crucial for stability assessment.​  

The findings from this research indicate that SNBS is indeed predictable using GNNs, although the performance exhibited considerable variation depending on the specific GNN model architecture employed [13]. A noteworthy advantage demonstrated was the potential for transfer learning: GNN models trained on data from smaller grid configurations could be successfully applied to predict stability in significantly larger grids without requiring retraining [13]. This transferability suggests a degree of scalability and generalization capability for GNN-based approaches in this domain.​  

Compared to traditional power system analysis methods, which often rely on complex simulations or simplified models that may struggle with the high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics introduced by modern grid complexities, GNNs offer an alternative that directly leverages the grid's structural data. The ability of GNNs to implicitly learn spatial dependencies and node interactions from the graph structure is a key strength in modeling large, interconnected systems. However, a detailed comparison of the performance and computational efficiency of GNNs against established traditional methods was not extensively covered in the provided digest. Potential limitations, beyond the observed performance variability across models, might include the need for large, representative datasets (even if synthetic) for training and the interpretability of complex GNN models in safety-critical power system applications. Despite these considerations, the demonstrated predictability and transferability highlight the significant potential of GNNs for enhancing power grid stability prediction in the context of evolving energy landscapes [13].​  

# 4.10 Human Decision-Making  

Predicting human decision-making in complex, dynamic environments is a significant challenge in cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Computational models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Bayesian models, have emerged as powerful tools for capturing the intricacies of human choices in structured psychological tasks. Research has explored the application of these models to scenarios such as the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), aiming to understand and predict human behavior based on interaction history and learned experiences [12].  

Recurrent neural networks, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have been employed to model decision processes in tasks requiring sequential processing and memory [12]. In the context of the IPD, LSTMs are utilized to predict whether an individual will choose to cooperate or defect, relying on the historical sequence of interactions between players [12]. Similarly, for the IGT, these networks predict a player's deck selection based on their cumulative experiences and outcomes associated with each deck over time [12]. Studies employing LSTM networks in these tasks compare their predictive performance against various baseline models [12], demonstrating the capacity of RNNs to capture temporal dependencies inherent in these sequential decision-making tasks.​  

Bayesian models offer an alternative framework, often focusing on probabilistic inference and the representation of cognitive states. These models are particularly adept at capturing complex cognitive processes such as beliefs, desires, intentions, and theory of mind, which are crucial for understanding social decision-making and interaction [20]. While the subsection description specifically mentions IPD and IGT, a related application involves using probabilistic models of theory of mind within a Bayesian framework to predict human behavior in social contexts like the volunteer's dilemma, a form of the public goods game [8]. This approach aims to predict individual actions (contribute or free-ride) and collective outcomes by modeling agents' beliefs about others' intentions and reasoning within the group dynamic [8]. Although this Bayesian application is demonstrated in a different social dilemma than the IPD or IGT, it highlights the strength of Bayesian inference in modeling underlying cognitive mechanisms and probabilistic reasoning that influence decisions, especially in interactive settings.​  

Comparing these approaches, RNNs, particularly LSTMs, excel at learning complex patterns and dependencies directly from sequential data without explicit assumptions about underlying cognitive processes [12]. They demonstrate effectiveness in tasks like IPD and IGT where past trials heavily influence current choices [12]. Bayesian models, conversely, provide a framework rooted in probabilistic reasoning and are powerful for explicitly modeling cognitive constructs like beliefs and theory of mind [8,20]. This allows for insights into the cognitive mechanisms driving decisions, potentially offering more interpretability regarding whya decision is made, rather than just predicting whatdecision will be made. While LSTMs have been shown to perform well in predicting outcomes in IPD and IGT compared to baselines [12], Bayesian models like the theory of mind model for the volunteer's dilemma provide a distinct perspective by explicitly incorporating social cognition into the predictive framework [8]. Integrating insights from both data-driven sequential models (RNNs) and cognitively inspired probabilistic models (Bayesian) offers complementary avenues for advancing the prediction and understanding of complex human decision-making under uncertainty.  

# 4.11 Knowledge Tracing (using Graph-based models)  

Graph-based models represent an advancing paradigm in knowledge tracing, offering enhanced capabilities for assessing student understanding by explicitly modeling complex relationships among learning concepts and the dynamic nature of knowledge acquisition and decay. A notable example in this domain is the Deep Graph Memory Network (DGMN) [13]. This model is specifically designed to address critical challenges in knowledge tracing, including the accurate modeling of student forgetting behaviors and the identification of intricate relationships between latent concepts [13].  

DGMN improves the accuracy of student knowledge assessment by leveraging a dynamic latent concept graph. This graph, which evolves based on a student's changing knowledge states, captures the mutual dependencies and relationships between different latent learning concepts. By representing these connections explicitly, the model can better infer a student's mastery level across interrelated skills and topics [13]. Furthermore, DGMN incorporates a sophisticated mechanism for modeling forgetting. It integrates a forget gating mechanism directly into an attention memory structure. This mechanism dynamically captures forgetting behaviors by considering attention forgetting features over the latent concepts and their learned mutual dependencies, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of how knowledge degrades over time [13]. The effectiveness of DGMN has been empirically validated through evaluation on four benchmark datasets, where it consistently demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art knowledge tracing models [13]. This indicates that the explicit modeling of concept relationships and forgetting dynamics through graph structures and attention mechanisms significantly contributes to improved prediction accuracy in knowledge tracing.  

# 5. Challenges and Future Directions

A fundamental obstacle lies in managing inherent computational complexity and ensuring scalability when applying these algorithms to large-scale problems, particularly in high-dimensional contexts [20]. The “curse of dimensionality” significantly expands the problem space, potentially rendering direct optimization intractable and increasing the resource demands of methods such as multi-armed bandit testing or stochastic quasi-Newton algorithms [1,15,23]. Addressing these bottlenecks necessitates exploring scalable solutions—including stochastic optimization, decomposition, approximation, parallelization, distributed computing, model reduction, and tailored algorithmic implementations such as Frank-Wolfe based optimizers or efficient zero-order methods like DeepZero [3,7,9,18,20].​  

Ensuring the robustness and generalization of contextual optimization algorithms is equally critical, as real-world environments are subject to data distribution shifts, model inaccuracies, and potential adversarial attacks. Algorithms must maintain performance despite model misspecification—a limitation that can be addressed via techniques such as Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) [20]—and resist deliberate manipulations through methods such as adversarial training [20]. Furthermore, effective generalization to unseen or changing environments is vital, requiring techniques to prevent overfitting and the development of careful model designs informed by data structure, particularly when handling heterogeneity or dependencies across data points [3,17,19]. Challenges also arise in specific domains, such as accurately modeling complex channel properties in wireless networks [16].​  

The deployment of contextual optimization in critical applications underscores the growing importance of explainability and interpretability [20,21]. Understanding how models arrive at their decisions is essential for debugging, validation, and fostering trust. While general techniques such as feature importance, rule extraction, counterfactuals, sensitivity analysis, and visualization are available [20], interpreting complex models like deep neural networks remains challenging. Such complexity demands task-specific analysis methods, including examining weight distributions or structured model parameters [8,12]. Furthermore, difficulties in capturing individual action strategies despite an overall accurate trend prediction highlight the granularity required for meaningful interpretation [12].​  

Moreover, integrating human factors and addressing potential algorithmic biases are essential to ensure fairness and accountability [20]. Human behaviors, which are influenced by factors such as prior experience and prosocial tendencies, introduce additional complexity [8,10]. Since biases in training data can be perpetuated by the resulting algorithms, proactive measures like fairness-aware and privacy-preserving optimization are required [20,21]. Ensuring accountability in complex, dynamic systems remains a challenge [20]. Additionally, decision theory faces limitations—sometimes being blind to unforeseen “unknown unknowns” [23]—while uncertainty permeates even human-driven processes such as academic publication cycles [14]. Managing new risks introduced by AI is also an emerging concern [10].​  

Addressing these challenges opens numerous promising research directions. A key avenue is the deeper integration of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, with optimization algorithms [3,20]. Machine learning can offer sophisticated contextual representations and uncertainty models, thereby informing optimization in diverse applications such as predicting human decisions, recommendation systems, and control processes via deep reinforcement learning [4,12,16,21]. Developing specialized optimization algorithms capable of handling the characteristics of large-scale, nonconvex deep learning models is crucial—exemplified by advancements in zero-order optimization like DeepZero [3,15]. Future work should explore extending learning methods from simplified models such as the Multi-Armed Bandit to address more complex real-world scenarios [2].​  

Further algorithmic advancements include exploring multi-objective optimization to handle conflicting goals in uncertain settings, a critical consideration for tasks like multi-agent resource allocation and multi-task learning [7,20,21]. Investigating online learning—especially within combinatorial settings—is vital for developing systems that can adapt to dynamic environments and learn from real-time feedback, thereby contributing to learning-based optimization [18,20]. Related areas such as stochastic, distributed, and asynchronous optimization continue to be active research fronts [18,21], as does exploring specific method enhancements like homogeneous self-dual embedding or alternative Pareto-optimal algorithms [5,7].​  

Finally, significant interdisciplinary opportunities exist by integrating contextual optimization with fields such as decision theory, behavioral economics, and the social sciences. This integration can offer deeper insights into human decisionmaking under uncertainty [10,14,23]. Incorporating domain knowledge—such as field sampling information in statistical modeling—is essential for developing more effective and less biased optimization strategies [17]. Exploring these interdisciplinary connections and addressing domain-specific challenges, such as achieving energy efficiency in data centers [16], will be critical for realizing the full potential of contextual optimization under uncertainty. The path forward involves developing algorithms that are not only scalable and robust but also transparent, ethical, and deeply integrated with domain-specific knowledge and human insight.  

# 5.1 Scalability and Computational Complexity  

Applying contextual optimization algorithms to real-world problems often encounters significant scalability and computational complexity challenges [20]. These difficulties are particularly pronounced when dealing with highdimensional contexts and large datasets. A fundamental issue is the "curse of dimensionality," where the problem space grows exponentially with the number of features, leading to a combinatorial explosion of possibilities [23]. This inherent complexity can render direct application of many optimization techniques computationally intractable.  

Specific algorithms also face unique resource demands. For instance, multi-armed bandit testing, a common approach in contextual decision-making, is noted as being more difficult and resource-intensive to execute compared to simpler methods like A/B testing [1]. Furthermore, stochastic quasi-Newton methods, while powerful, grapple with substantial computational and storage costs, which poses a key challenge for their application in large-scale settings [15].  

Addressing these computational bottlenecks is crucial for enabling the widespread deployment of contextual optimization methods. Several potential solutions have been explored or proposed to mitigate these challenges. For large datasets, employing stochastic optimization methods is a common strategy to reduce computational costs by using subsets of data for gradient estimation [18]. General techniques such as decomposition, which breaks down a large problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, and approximation algorithms, which aim for near-optimal solutions more efficiently, are also relevant [9,20].  

Parallelization offers another avenue for improving computational efficiency. Techniques like feature reuse and forward propagation parallelization have been introduced to mitigate computational bottlenecks, particularly in the context of coordinate gradient estimation for large models in zero-order optimization frameworks [3]. Beyond general parallelization, developing efficient algorithmic implementations tailored to specific problem structures can yield significant improvements. An example includes the use of a Frank-Wolfe based optimizer and the optimization of computation, such as utilizing a single backpropagation computation for the upper bound of the MGDA optimization objective in multi-objective optimization, explicitly addressing scalability and computational complexity [7]. Further potential solutions mentioned in the field include distributed computing and model reduction techniques, which aim to simplify the problem representation or distribute the computational load across multiple processors [9]. Efficient implementations of these techniques are necessary for applying contextual optimization algorithms effectively to large-scale problems [20].  

# 5.2 Robustness and Generalization  

Ensuring robustness and promoting generalization is paramount in real-world applications of contextual optimization under uncertainty. Practical scenarios often involve data distribution shifts, model inaccuracies, and potential adversarial manipulations, all of which can severely degrade the performance of optimization algorithms if not adequately addressed. A critical challenge is to develop algorithms that maintain their performance despite these uncertainties and adapt effectively to unseen or changing environments.​  

Model misspecification, where the assumed model does not perfectly reflect reality, is a significant source of uncertainty. Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) offers a framework to address this by optimizing against the worst-case distribution within a defined ambiguity set, thus providing protection against deviations from a nominal distribution [20]. This approach aims to yield solutions that are robust across a range of possible underlying data-generating processes, mitigating the risks associated with model inaccuracies.  

Beyond inherent model limitations, systems can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks designed to disrupt performance. Enhancing robustness against such deliberate manipulations is crucial. Adversarial training is a technique employed to improve resilience to these attacks by training models on adversarially perturbed data, thereby increasing their resistance to perturbations at inference time [20]. For instance, evaluations of frameworks like DeepZero have demonstrated superiority in defending against adversarial attacks in black-box defense scenarios compared to existing methods such as ZO-AE-DS [3]. This highlights the practical effectiveness of robust optimization and training strategies in adversarial settings.  

Adapting to changing environments and ensuring generalization to new data are also critical aspects of robustness. In deep learning, a key challenge lies in ensuring that optimization performed on a specific training set generalizes effectively to unseen test sets [19]. Techniques to enhance generalization include using batch normalization to mitigate issues like vanishing gradients, employing learning rate scheduling for more stable optimization trajectories, and incorporating weight regularization methods such as L2 regularization and dropout [19]. These methods help prevent overfitting to the training data and promote better performance on varied or future data distributions. Furthermore, modeling approaches that exploit natural correlations and account for heterogeneity across samples can demonstrate robustness and generalization even in the presence of substantial variability [17]. This suggests that careful model design, informed by the underlying data structure, can inherently contribute to long-term robustness and the ability to generalize across different settings.  

# 5.3 Explainability and Interpretability  

Explainability and interpretability are increasingly recognized as crucial aspects of contextual optimization models, particularly when these models are deployed in critical applications such as healthcare and finance, where trust, transparency, and accountability are paramount [20,21]. The capacity to understand how a model arrives at its decisions is essential for debugging, validating, ensuring fairness, and gaining user acceptance. Without interpretability, complex blackbox models can be difficult to trust, hindering their adoption in sensitive domains.  

Techniques for explaining the decisions made by contextual optimization models vary. General approaches include feature importance analysis, which quantifies the contribution of different input features to the model's output, and rule extraction, which approximates the model's logic with human-readable rules [20]. Counterfactual explanations provide insights by identifying the smallest change to the input that would alter the model's decision. Sensitivity analysis helps identify  

influential factors by evaluating how variations in input features or parameters affect the output [20]. Visualization techniques can also play a significant role in making complex model behaviors understandable [20].  

Beyond these general techniques, specific model architectures may lend themselves to particular interpretation methods. For instance, in the context of predicting human decision-making, attempts have been made to interpret trained deep learning models like LSTM networks [12]. One method involves comparing the weight distributions of the networks trained on different groups, such as top and bottom performers in decision-making tasks. In the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), top performers' LSTM weights were found to have a wider distribution and larger bias compared to bottom performers, potentially offering insights into the strategies employed by each group [12]. However, this specific difference in weight distribution was not observed in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), suggesting that interpretability approaches may need to be task-specific [12].​  

Another approach to gaining interpretability involves analyzing the parameters of structured models, such as Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) [8]. The learned parameters of a POMDP model can offer direct insights into subject behavior. For example, parameters like $\alpha _ { 1 }$ ​ , $\beta _ { 1 }$ ​ , and $\gamma$ in a POMDP model can reveal subjects' prior expectations regarding contributions and free-rides in a group setting, as well as the weight they assign to past observations when making decisions [8]. This parameter-based interpretation provides a different angle compared to analyzing internal network weights, linking model components directly to interpretable behavioral constructs. Both approaches highlight the ongoing effort to move beyond black-box predictions towards models whose decision-making processes are transparent and understandable.  

# 5.4 Human Factors, Biases, and Ethics  

Considering human factors and the potential for biases is paramount in the design and deployment of contextual optimization systems [20]. Human factors, such as prior experiences, beliefs, and even tendencies towards prosocial behavior, inherently influence decision-making processes [8,10]. When these human factors are not adequately accounted for, or when the data used to train or inform contextual optimization models reflects societal biases, the resulting algorithmic decisions can inadvertently perpetuate or even exacerbate existing inequalities.​  

Therefore, there is a critical need for fairness, transparency, and accountability in algorithmic decision-making within contextual optimization [20]. Addressing these ethical implications requires proactive measures to mitigate biases and ensure fairness. Key techniques in this domain include fairness-aware optimization and privacy-preserving optimization [20,21]. Fairness-aware optimization seeks to incorporate fairness constraints or objectives directly into the optimization problem formulation, aiming to achieve equitable outcomes across different demographic groups or protected attributes. Privacy-preserving optimization, on the other hand, focuses on safeguarding sensitive data used in the optimization process, aligning with broader ethical considerations around data privacy [21]. Research in this area, such as work on privacy-preserving distributed constrained optimization, is particularly relevant for applications involving decentralized data, like federated learning [21].​  

Despite the availability of these techniques, ensuring accountability in complex decision-making systems that integrate contextual optimization remains a significant challenge [20]. The intricate nature of these systems, often involving learning from dynamic contexts and making decisions under uncertainty, can make it difficult to trace the causality of a specific outcome to a particular input or model component. Establishing clear lines of responsibility and developing robust mechanisms for auditing and explaining algorithmic decisions are crucial steps towards building trustworthy and ethical contextual optimization systems. Addressing the influence of human factors and mitigating biases is not merely a technical challenge but a fundamental requirement for the responsible application of contextual optimization in real-world scenarios.  

# 5.5 Integration of Machine Learning and Optimization  

The increasing complexity of real-world problems necessitates a synergistic approach that combines the predictive power of machine learning (ML) with the decision-making capabilities of optimization. This integration is particularly crucial for handling high-dimensional data, complex contextual dependencies, and intricate uncertainty distributions [20]. Advanced ML techniques, notably deep learning, offer significant benefits by enabling the learning of sophisticated contextual representations and providing robust models for uncertainty [20]. These learned models and representations can then serve as inputs or components within optimization frameworks, leading to more effective and informed decision-making processes.  

Various applications demonstrate the promise of this integration. For instance, ML models can be used to predict dynamic systems or behaviors, whose outputs subsequently guide optimization. LSTM networks have been employed to predict human decision-making, with these predictions then informing downstream optimization and decision-making tasks [12]. In recommendation systems, ML models are used to understand context and predict user preferences, allowing optimization algorithms (such as those used in contextual bandits) to make optimal item selections [4]. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)—a prominent example of ML and optimization integration—has been applied in control systems, such as the UMGT scheme and dynamical economic dispatch, where deep neural networks learn policies to optimize complex sequential decision processes [16,21]. Hybrid modeling approaches that integrate physical knowledge with data-driven methods, often using ML, also represent this synergy, as seen in the modeling of complex channel properties [16]. Furthermore, the integration extends to statistical modeling and domain expertise combined with optimization for tasks like pooled testing [17], as well as the integration of multi-objective optimization with deep learning for complex multi-task learning problems [7,17]. Additional examples from diverse fields, including traffic state prediction ("DeepTSP") and data imputation ("CMGAN"), further highlight the pervasive nature of neural network-based ML approaches in supporting optimization goals [21].  

A key challenge in integrating deep learning and optimization lies in the nature of deep learning models: they are typically large-scale, non-convex, and computationally intensive to train. This necessitates the adaptation or development of optimization algorithms specifically tailored to work effectively within deep learning contexts. Traditional optimization methods may struggle with the scale and non-convexity of the objective functions encountered in deep network training. Research in this area focuses on developing efficient gradient-based methods—such as various stochastic optimization techniques overviewed in [15]—as well as alternative approaches. DeepZero represents a notable development: it is a framework that combines zeroth-order optimization techniques with model pruning and feature reuse specifically for training deep neural networks [3]. This framework is particularly valuable in scenarios where traditional gradient information is unavailable or difficult to compute, demonstrating how novel optimization methodologies are devised to overcome the unique challenges posed by deep learning architectures [3]. The continued advancement of such specialized optimization techniques is critical for unlocking the full potential of deep learning models in complex, context-dependent optimization problems.​  

# 5.6 Other Emerging Trends  

The field of contextual optimization under uncertainty is continuously evolving, with several emerging trends exploring novel approaches to tackle complex challenges. Among these, significant attention is being directed towards the application of multi-objective optimization techniques and the integration of online learning methodologies, particularly in combinatorial settings [20]. These directions aim to enhance the ability of optimization systems to handle conflicting goals, adapt to dynamic environments, and learn from real-time interactions.  

Multi-objective optimization provides a framework for simultaneously optimizing multiple, often competing, objectives under uncertain conditions [20]. This is crucial in real-world scenarios where a single performance metric is insufficient. Research interest in this area is evidenced by work focusing on multi-objective optimization problems, including multiagent approaches for distributed resource allocation in networked systems [21]. Exploring the potential of using multiobjective optimization within multi-task learning frameworks to identify Pareto optimal solutions under uncertainty represents a promising avenue for future research [7]. Furthermore, consideration of objectives that may not possess precise numerical values, as seen in preference-based planning [23], highlights the need for flexible multi-objective formulations in uncertain contexts.​  

Another critical emerging trend involves leveraging online learning approaches to enable optimization systems to adapt to changing environments and refine decisions based on real-time feedback [20]. Combinatorial online learning, in particular, addresses the challenges of decision-making in environments where the feasible actions form a combinatorial set and feedback is received sequentially. This area is vital for developing algorithms that can learn effective strategies dynamically as new information becomes available. Efforts in this domain contribute to the broader field of learning-based optimization, identified as a key direction for future research aimed at improving optimization performance through learned models or strategies [18]. Specific work in developing frameworks, such as zero-order optimization approaches, can be particularly relevant for online learning scenarios where gradient information is unavailable or costly to obtain [3].​  

Beyond these focused areas, related research directions such as stochastic optimization, distributed optimization, and asynchronous optimization are also being actively explored [18]. Distributed Nash equilibrium seeking algorithms in networked systems, for instance, combine aspects of distributed optimization and game theory to address coordination problems under uncertainty [21]. These diverse research threads collectively push the boundaries of contextual optimization under uncertainty by investigating new algorithmic paradigms and problem formulations.  

# 6. Conclusion  

Contextual optimization under uncertainty represents a critical area of research focused on enabling intelligent decisionmaking in dynamic and complex environments [10,16]. The core challenge lies in effectively balancing the need to explore new possibilities to gather information (exploration) with the desire to leverage existing knowledge to maximize immediate rewards (exploitation) [1,2]. Incorporating contextual information allows decision-making processes to be more informed and tailored to specific circumstances, while explicitly addressing uncertainty is essential for ensuring robustness and reliability in the face of incomplete or noisy data.​  

A key class of algorithms prominent in this field is Contextual Bandits [1]. These algorithms extend the fundamental MultiArmed Bandit framework to utilize contextual information, moving beyond the limitations of traditional A/B testing which involves distinct exploration and exploitation phases [1]. Contextual Bandits are designed to simultaneously engage in exploration and exploitation, gradually shifting resources towards more promising options [1]. This capability confers significant advantages, particularly in applications such as recommendation systems, where they can mitigate the "coldstart" problem for new items and counteract the Matthew effect by providing exposure opportunities for less popular or novel resources [4]. Beyond recommendations, Contextual Bandits demonstrate substantial business value through personalization at scale, dynamic adaptation to changing environments, elimination of opportunity costs associated with prolonged suboptimal choices, and enabling low-maintenance optimization [1].​  

The importance of considering both context and uncertainty is further underscored by research in diverse domains. For instance, optimizing pooled testing strategies requires integrating field sampling information with statistical modeling to account for sample correlations and heterogeneity, demonstrating how leveraging context and modeling uncertainty improves efficiency and sensitivity [17]. Similarly, understanding and predicting complex behaviors like human decisionmaking in group settings can be advanced by probabilistic models, such as Bayesian inference based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), which model the uncertainty about others' intentions and future group dynamics [8]. The need for efficient, stable, and reliable solutions is paramount in complex applied scenarios like wireless networks and control systems [16].  

Despite significant progress, contextual optimization under uncertainty faces several key challenges and open research questions. A fundamental requirement is the development of approaches that are not only effective but also robust, scalable, and interpretable. Specific algorithmic challenges include improving the applicability, computational efficiency, and convergence rates of methods, such as stochastic quasi-Newton techniques, particularly in large-scale machine learning applications [15]. Developing methods that can effectively handle complex, high-dimensional contextual information and dynamic environments remains an active area of research.  

Looking ahead, the future of contextual optimization under uncertainty holds promise and requires continued research across multiple fronts. Future work should focus on enhancing the theoretical foundations and practical performance of algorithms. This includes exploring novel algorithmic paradigms, such as zero-order optimization frameworks for scenarios lacking gradient information [3], and developing methods to address multi-objective optimization challenges inherent in complex multi-task learning settings [7]. Integrating insights from related fields, such as the use of advanced neural network architectures like LSTMs for predicting dynamic decision processes [12] and sophisticated probabilistic modeling techniques [8], will be crucial. Furthermore, there is a continuous need to develop methods that are specifically tailored to the unique requirements and complexities of various application domains, ensuring efficiency, stability, and reliability in real-world deployments [16,17]. Providing practitioners with comprehensive resources for readily available optimization tools is also valuable for facilitating the application of theoretical advancements [9]. Addressing these challenges will pave the way for more intelligent, adaptive, and reliable decision-making systems in an increasingly uncertain world.​
