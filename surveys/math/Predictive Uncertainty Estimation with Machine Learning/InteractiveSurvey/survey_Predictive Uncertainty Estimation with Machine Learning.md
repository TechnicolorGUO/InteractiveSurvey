# 2 Introduction
The field of machine learning has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, driven by the increasing availability of data and the development of sophisticated algorithms. However, one of the critical challenges that persists is the accurate quantification of predictive uncertainty [1]. Uncertainty estimation is essential for building reliable and robust models, particularly in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, autonomous systems, and financial forecasting [2]. Traditional machine learning models often provide point predictions without any measure of confidence, which can lead to overconfident and potentially erroneous decisions. This survey paper focuses on the latest developments in predictive uncertainty estimation, specifically within the context of machine learning models [3]. It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the methods, techniques, and applications that have emerged to address this challenge.

This survey paper delves into the various aspects of predictive uncertainty estimation in machine learning, covering a broad spectrum of topics from theoretical foundations to practical applications [3]. The paper begins by exploring the different types of uncertainty, including aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, and discusses how these can be effectively modeled and quantified [4]. It then delves into specific techniques such as probabilistic models for label noise, prediction uncertainty indices for concept drift, and self-calibrated tuning for out-of-distribution detection. These techniques are crucial for ensuring that machine learning models can handle noisy data, adapt to changing environments, and generalize well to unseen data.

The paper also examines the role of uncertainty in fairness and performance, highlighting how multi-task learning with Monte Carlo Dropout, source-free unsupervised domain adaptation, and conformal prediction for noisy data can enhance the reliability and robustness of machine learning models. These methods are particularly relevant in scenarios where data is imbalanced or biased, and where the model must operate in dynamic and uncertain environments. Furthermore, the survey explores efficient uncertainty estimation techniques, such as accelerated ensemble error bar prediction and uncertainty in catastrophic forgetting, which are essential for real-time and resource-constrained applications.

Additionally, the paper discusses hybrid models for uncertainty quantification, including ensemble and training methods, and evaluates their theoretical and empirical performance [5]. It covers topics such as ensemble models for heteroscedastic uncertainty, uncertainty-based active learning, and post-hoc calibration techniques. These methods are designed to improve the reliability of probabilistic predictions by adjusting the output probabilities of trained models, ensuring that they are well-calibrated and reflective of the true likelihood of events.

Finally, the paper explores the integration of physics-informed and data-driven approaches, focusing on applications such as physics-based machine learning for turbulence, hybrid semi-parametric models for power prediction, and uncertainty in multimodal data. These advanced techniques combine the strengths of physical models and data-driven methods to provide more accurate and interpretable predictions, particularly in complex and dynamic systems.

The contributions of this survey paper are multifaceted. It provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in predictive uncertainty estimation, synthesizing insights from a wide range of research papers and practical applications [3]. The paper also identifies key challenges and open research questions, offering a roadmap for future research in this critical area. By bridging the gap between theory and practice, this survey aims to facilitate the development of more reliable and robust machine learning models, ultimately contributing to the broader goal of building trustworthy artificial intelligence systems.

# 3 Uncertainty in Machine Learning Models

## 3.1 Probabilistic Models for Label Noise

### 3.1.1 Heteroscedastic Aleatoric Uncertainty
Heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty is a critical aspect of uncertainty quantification in machine learning, particularly in scenarios where the noise in the data varies across different input regions [6]. Unlike homoscedastic uncertainty, which assumes constant noise levels across the input space, heteroscedastic uncertainty acknowledges that the variability in the data can depend on the input features [6]. This is particularly relevant in applications such as materials science, where the quality and consistency of experimental data can vary significantly depending on the specific conditions under which the data were collected.

In the context of deep learning models, heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty can be effectively modeled using probabilistic approaches that allow the model to predict not only the mean output but also the variance of the output distribution. This is achieved by modifying the loss function to include terms that penalize the model for incorrect predictions of the variance. For instance, in regression tasks, the model can be trained to output both the mean and the variance of the predicted values, and the loss function can be designed to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the observed data given the predicted distribution. This approach ensures that the model not only fits the mean response well but also accurately captures the variability in the data.

The ability to model heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty is particularly valuable in applications where the data are inherently noisy or where the noise structure is complex and input-dependent [7]. For example, in materials science, the properties of materials can exhibit significant variability depending on factors such as temperature, pressure, and chemical composition. By accounting for this variability, models can provide more reliable predictions and better support decision-making processes. Additionally, in medical imaging, where label noise is common due to the subjective nature of annotations, heteroscedastic uncertainty models can help identify regions of high uncertainty, guiding further data collection or expert review [7]. Overall, the incorporation of heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty into machine learning models enhances their robustness and reliability, making them more suitable for real-world applications where data quality and consistency are often challenging to ensure [7].

### 3.1.2 Prediction Uncertainty Index for Concept Drift
Prediction Uncertainty Index (PU-index) serves as a critical metric for detecting concept drift in machine learning models, particularly in scenarios where data distribution shifts over time. Unlike traditional error-based metrics, the PU-index focuses on the variability and reliability of model predictions, offering a more nuanced perspective on model performance degradation. By quantifying the uncertainty associated with each prediction, the PU-index can identify subtle changes in the underlying data distribution that might not be immediately apparent through error rates alone [8]. This is particularly valuable in dynamic environments where the model must continuously adapt to new data patterns.

The PU-index is calculated by aggregating the uncertainty scores of individual predictions, typically derived from methods such as Monte Carlo Dropout or ensemble models. These methods provide a distribution of predictions for each input, allowing for the computation of metrics like entropy or variance, which serve as proxies for prediction uncertainty. When the PU-index distribution shows a significant shift, it indicates a potential concept drift, prompting further investigation or model retraining [8]. This approach is advantageous because it can detect drift even before the error rate starts to increase, providing a proactive mechanism for maintaining model performance.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the PU-index, we conducted a series of experiments comparing it with traditional error-based metrics. The results demonstrate that the PU-index is at least as sensitive as error-based metrics and often more sensitive in detecting early signs of concept drift [8]. Specifically, in scenarios where the data distribution changes gradually, the PU-index can identify drift earlier, allowing for timely interventions. Additionally, the PU-index provides a more comprehensive view of model behavior, helping to distinguish between genuine concept drift and temporary fluctuations in data. This makes it a robust tool for monitoring and maintaining the reliability of machine learning models in real-world applications.

### 3.1.3 Self-Calibrated Tuning for Out-of-Distribution Detection
Self-Calibrated Tuning (SCT) is a novel learning framework designed to mitigate the adverse effects of spurious out-of-distribution (OOD) features on model training [9]. SCT dynamically adjusts the weight of OOD regularization for different training samples based on their prediction uncertainty, thereby calibrating their influence on the overall training process. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where OOD features can lead to overfitting or misleading the model towards irrelevant patterns. By adaptively modulating the regularization strength, SCT ensures that the model focuses more on reliable in-distribution (ID) data while gradually incorporating OOD data in a controlled manner.

In practice, SCT operates by estimating the prediction uncertainty of each training sample using techniques such as Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD). MCD involves performing multiple forward passes with different dropout masks to create a distribution of outputs, which is then used to compute the uncertainty. Samples with higher uncertainty are assigned lower weights in the OOD regularization term, reducing their impact on the model's learning dynamics. Conversely, samples with lower uncertainty are given higher weights, allowing the model to benefit more from their informative contributions. This self-calibration mechanism helps the model to converge more robustly and generalize better to unseen data.

To validate the effectiveness of SCT, extensive experiments were conducted on various benchmark datasets, including both synthetic and real-world data. The results demonstrated that SCT significantly improves the model's OOD detection performance, especially in scenarios with limited ID data [9]. Compared to traditional methods that apply uniform regularization, SCT shows a marked reduction in false positives and false negatives, leading to more reliable and accurate OOD detection [9]. Additionally, the framework's flexibility allows it to be seamlessly integrated into existing deep learning architectures, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the robustness of machine learning models in the face of distribution shifts.

## 3.2 Uncertainty in Fairness and Performance

### 3.2.1 Multi-Task Learning with Monte Carlo Dropout
Multi-Task Learning (MTL) with Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) is a powerful approach that integrates the benefits of MTL for shared learning across related tasks with the robust uncertainty quantification provided by MCD [10]. In this framework, a single neural network is trained to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, allowing the model to leverage shared features and reduce overfitting. MCD, a Bayesian approximation technique, is employed during the inference phase to estimate the uncertainty of the model's predictions. By applying dropout at test time, MCD generates multiple stochastic forward passes, each with a different set of active neurons, resulting in a distribution of predictions. This distribution is then used to compute the predictive uncertainty, which is crucial for tasks where the reliability of predictions is paramount, such as in medical imaging or autonomous driving.

The integration of MCD into MTL enhances the model's ability to handle out-of-distribution (OOD) data and noisy labels, which are common challenges in real-world applications. The ensemble of predictions from multiple forward passes with different dropout masks helps to mitigate the impact of spurious correlations and overfitting, leading to more robust and generalizable models [10]. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where data distributions shift over time, such as in concept drift or federated learning settings [8]. The uncertainty estimates provided by MCD can be used to identify and down-weight unreliable predictions, thereby improving the overall performance and reliability of the model. Additionally, the uncertainty information can be leveraged to guide active learning strategies, where the model can request human annotations for the most uncertain predictions, thus optimizing the labeling effort.

In practice, the MTL framework with MCD can be applied to a variety of tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. For instance, in medical imaging, the model can be trained to predict both the presence of a disease and its severity, while also estimating the uncertainty of these predictions. This dual-task setup not only improves the accuracy of the primary task but also provides valuable insights into the model's confidence, which is essential for clinical decision-making. The computational efficiency of MCD, requiring only a few forward passes, makes it a practical choice for real-time applications. Overall, the combination of MTL and MCD offers a robust and versatile solution for enhancing the reliability and adaptability of deep learning models in complex and dynamic environments.

### 3.2.2 Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the challenge of adapting a pretrained model to a new domain without access to the source domain data, which is often restricted due to privacy, storage, or regulatory constraints [11]. This setting is particularly relevant in applications such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and remote sensing, where labeled data in the target domain is scarce or unavailable. SFUDA methods typically rely on the pretrained model's knowledge and the unlabeled target data to align the feature distributions between the source and target domains [11]. The primary goal is to ensure that the model's performance on the target domain is as close as possible to its performance on the source domain, despite the domain shift.

One of the key challenges in SFUDA is the generation of reliable pseudo-labels for the target domain data. Pseudo-labeling involves using the pretrained model to predict labels for the target data, which are then used to fine-tune the model. However, the quality of these pseudo-labels can be compromised by the domain shift, leading to noisy or incorrect labels. This issue is exacerbated when the target data is inherently noisy or uncertain, as the model may overfit to these noisy labels, thereby degrading its performance. To mitigate this, various techniques have been proposed, such as self-training with confidence thresholds, where only high-confidence predictions are used for fine-tuning, and consistency regularization, which encourages the model to produce consistent predictions for different augmentations of the same target sample.

Another critical aspect of SFUDA is the adaptation of the model's feature extractor to the target domain [11]. This is often achieved through domain alignment techniques, such as adversarial training, where a discriminator is trained to distinguish between source and target features, and the feature extractor is trained to fool the discriminator. Additionally, moment matching techniques, which align the statistical moments of the source and target feature distributions, have also been effective. These methods aim to reduce the distributional differences between the source and target domains, thereby improving the model's generalization to the target domain. However, the effectiveness of these techniques can vary depending on the nature of the domain shift and the complexity of the target data.

### 3.2.3 Conformal Prediction for Noisy Data
Conformal prediction (CP) is a robust framework for providing uncertainty estimates in machine learning predictions, particularly valuable in noisy data environments [12]. Traditional CP methods assume clean labels for constructing prediction sets, but in practical scenarios, label noise is prevalent, especially in domains like medical imaging and materials science. Label noise can arise from ambiguous data, expert disagreements, or other sources, leading to unreliable ground truth labels. To address this, recent advancements have focused on developing CP algorithms that can effectively handle noisy labels while maintaining the statistical guarantees of coverage.

One approach involves estimating the noise-free conformal score from noisy labels before applying the standard CP algorithm [13]. This method aims to mitigate the over-conservativeness of prediction sets that can occur when directly applying CP to noisy data. By refining the conformal scores, these algorithms can achieve more precise and reliable prediction intervals, even in the presence of significant label noise [14]. Another strategy is to use a validation set with noisy labels, where the noise is accounted for through conservative coverage bounds. While this approach can lead to larger prediction sets, it ensures that the coverage guarantees are maintained, making it suitable for high-stakes applications where false negatives are particularly costly.

To further enhance the robustness of CP in noisy environments, researchers have explored integrating CP with other techniques such as active learning and semi-supervised learning. Active learning can help identify and correct noisy labels by iteratively querying a human expert for the most uncertain predictions, thereby improving the quality of the training data [15]. Semi-supervised learning, on the other hand, leverages a large amount of unlabeled data to refine the model's understanding of the data distribution, reducing the impact of noisy labels. These hybrid approaches not only improve the accuracy of the prediction sets but also enhance the overall reliability of the machine learning models in noisy data settings.

## 3.3 Efficient Uncertainty Estimation

### 3.3.1 Accelerated Ensemble Error Bar Prediction
Accelerated Ensemble Error Bar Prediction (AEEP) is a method designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of uncertainty quantification in machine learning models, particularly in scenarios where real-time or near-real-time performance is critical. AEEP leverages the power of ensemble models, which are known for their robustness and ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates. By combining the predictions of multiple models, AEEP can produce more accurate and consistent error bars, which are essential for applications that require a high degree of confidence in model predictions, such as autonomous systems, medical diagnostics, and financial forecasting.

The core of AEEP lies in its ability to accelerate the ensemble process without sacrificing the quality of uncertainty estimates. This is achieved through the use of advanced sampling techniques and parallel computing strategies. For instance, the method can dynamically adjust the number of models in the ensemble based on the complexity of the input data and the required level of uncertainty quantification. This adaptive approach ensures that the ensemble remains computationally efficient while maintaining high predictive accuracy. Additionally, AEEP incorporates techniques such as dropout and bootstrapping to introduce variability in the training process, which helps in capturing the epistemic uncertainty of the model. By doing so, AEEP can provide a more comprehensive and reliable measure of uncertainty compared to single-model approaches.

To further enhance the performance of AEEP, the method also integrates conformal prediction (CP) techniques. CP is a distribution-free framework that provides valid prediction intervals with a specified coverage probability. By combining CP with ensemble methods, AEEP can produce error bars that are both statistically valid and computationally efficient. This integration is particularly useful in scenarios where the data distribution is unknown or non-stationary, as it allows the model to adapt to changes in the data over time. The combination of ensemble methods and CP in AEEP not only improves the reliability of uncertainty estimates but also ensures that the model remains robust to various types of data anomalies and distribution shifts.

### 3.3.2 Uncertainty in Catastrophic Forgetting
Catastrophic forgetting (CF) is a significant challenge in continuous learning scenarios, where neural networks tend to lose previously acquired knowledge when learning new tasks [16]. This phenomenon is particularly problematic in dynamic environments where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a degradation in model performance on older tasks. The root cause of CF lies in the model's inability to retain information from past tasks while adapting to new ones, often due to the limited capacity of the neural network and the overwriting of learned representations. Addressing CF requires a nuanced understanding of the uncertainty associated with the model's predictions, especially in the context of how this uncertainty evolves as the model learns new tasks.

One approach to mitigating CF involves leveraging uncertainty quantification to dynamically adjust the learning process [16]. Techniques such as Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide probabilistic estimates of model uncertainty, which can be used to identify and preserve critical information from past tasks. MCD, for instance, introduces stochasticity during inference by performing multiple forward passes with different dropout masks, thereby generating a distribution of outputs that reflects the model's uncertainty. This uncertainty can be used to prioritize the retention of important features and to guide the learning process towards more stable and generalizable representations. Similarly, BNNs explicitly model the posterior distribution over model parameters, allowing for a more principled approach to uncertainty quantification and helping to prevent the overfitting that often leads to CF.

Another strategy to address CF is through the use of memory-augmented architectures and rehearsal methods. These approaches maintain a memory buffer of representative samples from past tasks, which are periodically revisited during the training of new tasks. By incorporating these samples into the training process, the model can be encouraged to retain knowledge from previous tasks while learning new ones. Additionally, recent advancements in uncertainty-aware memory management, such as the use of Bregman Information (BI) as a generalized variance measure, offer a more sophisticated way to select and store the most informative and uncertain samples in the memory buffer [16]. This not only helps in preserving important knowledge but also enhances the model's ability to generalize across tasks, thereby reducing the risk of catastrophic forgetting.

### 3.3.3 Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification for Medical Diagnosis
Hybrid uncertainty quantification (UQ) in medical diagnosis integrates multiple sources of uncertainty to enhance the reliability and robustness of machine learning models [17]. This approach is particularly critical in medical applications, where the consequences of incorrect predictions can be severe [17]. By combining aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, hybrid UQ methods aim to provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's confidence in its predictions. Aleatoric uncertainty captures the inherent randomness in the data, such as measurement noise or variability in patient symptoms, while epistemic uncertainty reflects the model's uncertainty due to limited training data or model architecture [7].

One of the key challenges in medical diagnosis is the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which can arise from variations in patient populations, imaging modalities, or clinical settings. Traditional UQ methods often struggle to detect and handle OOD data effectively, leading to overconfident predictions that can be misleading. Hybrid UQ methods address this issue by incorporating techniques such as Bayesian neural networks, ensemble methods, and conformal prediction. Bayesian neural networks provide a principled way to estimate epistemic uncertainty by placing probabilistic priors over the model parameters, while ensemble methods aggregate predictions from multiple models to reduce variance and improve robustness [4]. Conformal prediction, on the other hand, offers a distribution-free approach to constructing prediction intervals that ensure a specified coverage level, making it particularly suitable for safety-critical applications like medical diagnosis [14].

In practice, hybrid UQ methods have shown promise in various medical imaging tasks, such as detecting abnormalities in X-rays, MRI scans, and histopathological images. These methods not only help in identifying uncertain predictions but also enable the integration of expert knowledge and clinical guidelines to refine the model's outputs. For instance, by flagging high-uncertainty cases for review by medical professionals, hybrid UQ can enhance the overall diagnostic workflow and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis [17]. Additionally, the ability to quantify and communicate uncertainty to clinicians can foster greater trust in AI-assisted diagnosis, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

# 4 Hybrid Models for Uncertainty Quantification

## 4.1 Ensemble and Training Methods

### 4.1.1 Ensemble Models for Heteroscedastic Uncertainty
Ensemble models for heteroscedastic uncertainty are a class of techniques designed to capture and quantify the variability in predictions that arises from both the data and the model itself. These models are particularly useful in scenarios where the variance of the error term is not constant across different input regions, a phenomenon known as heteroscedasticity. By combining multiple models, ensemble methods can provide more robust and reliable uncertainty estimates, which are crucial for decision-making in high-stakes applications such as autonomous systems and financial forecasting. The key idea behind ensemble models is to leverage the diversity in predictions from multiple base models to estimate both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Aleatoric uncertainty, which is inherent in the data, can be estimated by the variability in the model's predictions for a given input, while epistemic uncertainty, which is due to the model's limitations, can be captured by the variability in the model parameters or the predictions across different models in the ensemble [7].

One of the most widely used ensemble methods for heteroscedastic uncertainty is the deep ensemble approach [5]. In this method, multiple neural networks are trained independently, each with different initializations or training data. The predictions from these networks are then combined to form a final prediction, and the variability in these predictions is used to estimate the uncertainty. This approach has the advantage of being straightforward to implement and can be applied to any neural network architecture without requiring significant modifications. However, it suffers from high computational costs, as each network in the ensemble must be trained and evaluated separately. To address this limitation, recent research has explored techniques such as Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and Monte Carlo dropout, which can provide uncertainty estimates with a single forward pass or a small number of forward passes, thereby reducing the computational overhead [10].

Another important aspect of ensemble models for heteroscedastic uncertainty is the maintenance of diversity among the base models. Ensuring that the models in the ensemble are diverse and not overly correlated is crucial for obtaining reliable uncertainty estimates [6]. Techniques such as training with different subsets of the data, using different architectures, or applying regularization methods like dropout can help maintain this diversity. Additionally, recent advances in active learning have shown that selecting the most informative samples for labeling can further improve the performance of ensemble models by focusing on regions of the input space where the uncertainty is highest [18]. This not only enhances the model's predictive accuracy but also provides more accurate and interpretable uncertainty estimates, which are essential for applications where the stakes are high and decisions must be made with confidence.

### 4.1.2 Uncertainty-based Active Learning
Uncertainty-based Active Learning (UAL) is a prominent strategy within the realm of active learning, designed to optimize the labeling process by selecting the most informative samples for annotation [18]. This approach leverages the model's uncertainty to identify instances where the model is least confident, thereby focusing on areas that could most benefit from additional labeled data. The primary advantage of UAL lies in its ability to enhance model performance with minimal labeling effort, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where labeling costs are high or the availability of expert annotators is limited.

In practice, UAL employs various metrics to quantify uncertainty, such as entropy, margin, and least confidence. Entropy, for instance, measures the unpredictability of the classification distribution, with higher entropy indicating greater uncertainty. Margin-based methods select samples where the difference between the highest and second-highest class probabilities is smallest, while least confidence focuses on samples with the lowest predicted probability for the most likely class. These metrics help in identifying the most ambiguous samples, which are then queried for labeling. The iterative nature of UAL, where the model is retrained after each labeling round, ensures that the model progressively improves its performance and reduces uncertainty over time.

Recent advances in UAL have explored more sophisticated methods for uncertainty quantification, such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD), which combines information-theoretic principles to select samples that maximize the reduction in model uncertainty [15]. Additionally, deep learning models have been integrated into UAL frameworks, enabling the use of complex architectures to capture intricate patterns in data. Despite its effectiveness, UAL faces challenges such as the potential for overfitting and the need for careful hyperparameter tuning [15]. Nonetheless, its ability to efficiently utilize labeled data makes it a valuable tool in the development of robust and reliable machine learning models [19].

### 4.1.3 Post-hoc Calibration Techniques
Post-hoc calibration techniques are essential for improving the reliability of probabilistic predictions by adjusting the output probabilities of a trained model [5]. These techniques are particularly useful when the model's raw outputs are poorly calibrated, meaning that the predicted probabilities do not accurately reflect the true likelihood of the events. Commonly used post-hoc calibration methods include Platt scaling and Venn-ABERS predictors [5]. Platt scaling involves fitting a logistic regression model to the output scores of a classifier using a separate calibration dataset. This method effectively transforms the classifier's scores into well-calibrated probabilities, thereby enhancing the model's reliability.

Venn-ABERS predictors, on the other hand, are a more recent and sophisticated approach that provides a non-parametric way to calibrate probabilities [5]. Unlike Platt scaling, which assumes a logistic relationship between the classifier scores and the true probabilities, Venn-ABERS predictors use a combination of Venn diagrams and empirical Bayes methods to estimate the calibration function. This approach is particularly advantageous in scenarios where the relationship between the scores and the true probabilities is complex and nonlinear. Both methods require a separate calibration set, which is used to train the calibration function. The choice between Platt scaling and Venn-ABERS predictors often depends on the specific characteristics of the problem, such as the size of the calibration set and the complexity of the relationship between the scores and the true probabilities.

Despite their effectiveness, post-hoc calibration techniques have limitations. They can only adjust the probabilities of a fixed model and do not address the underlying issues that cause miscalibration, such as model misspecification or overfitting. Additionally, the performance of these techniques can degrade if the calibration set is not representative of the test data. Nevertheless, post-hoc calibration remains a valuable tool in the machine learning practitioner's toolkit, especially when deployed in safety-critical applications where well-calibrated probabilities are essential for making informed decisions.

## 4.2 Theoretical and Empirical Evaluations

### 4.2.1 Cross-Entropy Framework for Uncertainty Measures
The cross-entropy framework serves as a foundational tool for quantifying predictive uncertainty in machine learning models, particularly in scenarios where the true data-generating process is unknown [3]. This framework is based on the cross-entropy between the predicting model and the true model, which measures the discrepancy between the predicted probability distribution and the actual distribution of the data [3]. Despite the intractability of computing the true cross-entropy due to the unknown nature of the true model, various approximations and assumptions have been proposed to estimate this measure [3]. These approximations are crucial for practical applications, as they enable the assessment of model uncertainty without requiring explicit knowledge of the true data-generating process.

One of the primary methods for approximating the cross-entropy is through the entropy of the posterior predictive distribution, which has become a standard measure in uncertainty quantification. This measure evaluates the entropy of the probability distribution over possible outcomes given the observed data and the model parameters. However, this approach has been criticized for its sensitivity to model misspecification and overfitting, leading to the development of alternative measures. For instance, the Information Theoretic (IT) approach and the Gaussian Logits (GL) approach have been proposed to disentangle aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, providing more nuanced insights into the sources of uncertainty [4]. The IT approach focuses on the mutual information between the model's predictions and the true labels, while the GL approach models the logits as Gaussian distributions to capture the variability in the model's predictions [4].

In the context of practical applications, the cross-entropy framework is particularly useful for evaluating the performance of models in real-world scenarios, such as in the wind energy sector, where uncertainty quantification can provide valuable insights into the reliability and robustness of predictive models. By leveraging the cross-entropy framework, researchers and practitioners can develop more accurate and reliable models, ensuring that they are well-calibrated and capable of handling various sources of uncertainty. This is especially important in safety-critical applications, where the ability to quantify and manage uncertainty is essential for making informed decisions and mitigating risks.

### 4.2.2 Martingale Posteriors for Near-Bayes Optimal Algorithms
Martingale posteriors (MPs) represent a novel approach to achieving near-Bayes optimal performance in machine learning algorithms, particularly in scenarios where the true prior distribution is unknown or intractable. The core idea behind MPs is to generate synthetic data using an algorithm \( A \) and then reapply \( A \) to a combined dataset of real and synthetic data. This process effectively simulates a martingale-like behavior, where the posterior distribution of parameter estimates converges to the true posterior as more data is added [20]. By leveraging this property, MPs can approximate the Bayesian posterior without the need for explicit prior specification, thus overcoming a significant limitation of traditional Bayesian methods.

In practice, the effectiveness of MPs hinges on the algorithm \( A \) satisfying a condition similar to that of an approximate martingale [20]. This condition ensures that the algorithm's performance on the synthetic data is consistent with its performance on the real data, thereby maintaining the integrity of the posterior estimates. The near-Bayes optimality of such algorithms is grounded in the principle that knowledge of the true Bayesian posterior would minimize the expected loss, a property that MPs aim to approximate [20]. This approach is particularly useful in complex, high-dimensional settings where traditional Bayesian methods are computationally prohibitive or where the prior distribution is difficult to specify accurately.

To illustrate the practical utility of MPs, consider a scenario where a machine learning model is trained on a limited dataset with significant uncertainty. By generating synthetic data that mimics the characteristics of the real data, and then retraining the model on the combined dataset, the model can better generalize and provide more reliable predictions. This method not only enhances the robustness of the model but also provides a principled way to quantify uncertainty in predictions, which is crucial for applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems [3]. The use of MPs thus represents a promising direction for developing algorithms that can achieve near-Bayes optimal performance while remaining computationally feasible and adaptable to a wide range of real-world problems.

### 4.2.3 Robust Reduced-Order Models
Reduced-order models (ROMs) are essential tools in the simulation of complex physical systems, offering a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy [21]. These models reduce the dimensionality of the original system, enabling faster simulations while retaining key dynamical features. Techniques such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), the reduced basis method, and balanced truncation are widely used to construct ROMs. POD, for instance, relies on a data-driven approach to identify the most energetic modes of the system, which are then used to project the full-order model (FOM) onto a lower-dimensional subspace. This method has been particularly effective in fluid dynamics, where it can significantly reduce computational costs while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

However, the robustness of ROMs is a critical concern, especially in scenarios where the model must handle a wide range of operating conditions or uncertainties. Intrusive ROMs, which require modifications to the original FOM solver, can provide more accurate predictions but are limited by their dependence on the specific implementation details of the FOM [21]. Non-intrusive ROMs, on the other hand, are more flexible and can be applied to a broader range of problems without requiring access to the underlying equations. These models typically use interpolation techniques to map input parameters to ROM predictions, making them suitable for black-box systems. Despite their flexibility, non-intrusive ROMs may suffer from reduced accuracy in regions of the parameter space that are not well-represented in the training data.

To enhance the robustness of ROMs, recent research has focused on integrating uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods. By incorporating UQ, ROMs can provide not only predictions but also estimates of the associated uncertainties, which is crucial for decision-making in safety-critical applications. Techniques such as Bayesian inference and ensemble methods have been explored to quantify both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties [5]. Aleatory uncertainties, which are inherent in the system and irreducible, can be addressed through probabilistic models that capture the variability in the input data [1]. Epistemic uncertainties, which arise from model inadequacies and can be reduced with more data or improved models, are often estimated using ensemble methods or Bayesian approaches [5]. These advancements in UQ are essential for building trust in ROMs and ensuring their reliability in real-world applications.

## 4.3 Physics-Informed and Data-Driven Integration

### 4.3.1 Physics-Based Machine Learning for Turbulence
Physics-based machine learning (PbML) for turbulence has emerged as a promising approach to bridge the gap between data-driven models and traditional physics-based models. By integrating physical laws and constraints into machine learning algorithms, PbML aims to enhance the accuracy and robustness of turbulence predictions. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a notable example of PbML, where the neural network is trained to satisfy the governing equations of fluid dynamics, such as the Navier-Stokes equations, alongside fitting the data [22]. This integration ensures that the learned model not only fits the observed data but also adheres to the underlying physical principles, thereby improving the generalization and reliability of the predictions.

One of the key challenges in turbulence modeling is the accurate representation of subgrid-scale (SGS) processes, which are often too computationally expensive to resolve directly in large-scale simulations. PbML approaches, particularly those using PINNs, have shown potential in learning these SGS models from high-fidelity data. By training on data from direct numerical simulations (DNS) or large eddy simulations (LES), PINNs can learn to predict the SGS stresses and other relevant quantities, thereby improving the fidelity of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both data-driven and physics-based methods, offering a more efficient and accurate alternative to traditional turbulence models.

However, the application of PbML in turbulence modeling is not without its challenges. One significant issue is the need for high-quality, high-fidelity data to train the models effectively. The scarcity of such data, especially for complex and realistic flow conditions, can limit the performance and generalizability of PbML models. Additionally, the computational cost of training PINNs and other PbML models can be substantial, particularly for large-scale and high-resolution simulations. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of PbML in enhancing the predictive capabilities of turbulence models make it an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to address these limitations and further refine the integration of physics and machine learning.

### 4.3.2 Hybrid Semi-Parametric Models for Power Prediction
Hybrid semi-parametric models for power prediction in wind turbines (WTs) integrate the strengths of physics-based models and data-driven approaches, offering a balanced solution that enhances both accuracy and interpretability [23]. These models typically consist of a physics-based component that captures the underlying physical laws governing the operation of WTs, such as aerodynamics and mechanical dynamics. This component provides a baseline prediction of power output based on input variables like wind speed, direction, and turbine state. However, due to the inherent complexities and nonlinearities in WT operations, the physics-based model alone may not fully capture the nuances of real-world performance. To address this, a data-driven component, often implemented as a neural network, is introduced to learn the residuals between the observed power output and the physics-based predictions. This dual approach ensures that the model can adapt to site-specific conditions and operational variations, thereby improving overall prediction accuracy.

The integration of the physics-based and data-driven components in hybrid semi-parametric models is achieved through a structured framework that leverages the complementary strengths of each [23]. The physics-based component serves as a constraint, ensuring that the predictions adhere to known physical laws and reducing the risk of overfitting. Meanwhile, the data-driven component, typically a neural network, captures the residual errors and fine-tunes the predictions to match the observed data more closely. This combination not only improves the accuracy of power predictions but also maintains the interpretability of the model, allowing for a better understanding of the factors influencing power generation. The neural network can be trained using backpropagation to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual power outputs, effectively learning the complex mappings that are not captured by the physics-based model [22].

Explainability is a critical aspect of hybrid semi-parametric models, as it enables operators and engineers to gain insights into the model's decision-making process. Techniques such as sensitivity analysis and partial dependence plots can be employed to dissect the contributions of different input variables to the final power predictions. This level of transparency is particularly valuable in the context of wind energy management, where understanding the drivers of power output is essential for optimizing turbine performance and grid integration. Additionally, the hybrid approach facilitates the incorporation of uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for reliable power forecasting. By combining the deterministic nature of physics-based models with the probabilistic capabilities of neural networks, these models can provide not only point predictions but also confidence intervals, enhancing the robustness of the predictions and supporting more informed decision-making in wind farm operations [23].

### 4.3.3 Uncertainty in Multimodal Data
Uncertainty in multimodal data arises from the inherent variability and noise present in different modalities, such as images, text, and sensor readings. Each modality can introduce distinct types of uncertainty, including aleatoric (irreducible randomness) and epistemic (model uncertainty) [7]. For instance, visual data can be affected by lighting conditions, occlusions, and camera angles, while textual data can suffer from ambiguities and contextual nuances. The integration of these modalities in a unified framework necessitates a careful consideration of how these uncertainties propagate and interact. Advanced techniques, such as Bayesian neural networks and ensemble methods, are often employed to quantify and mitigate these uncertainties, ensuring that the final fused representation is robust and reliable [24].

In the context of autonomous systems, multimodal data fusion is crucial for enhancing situational awareness and decision-making capabilities. However, the presence of uncertainties can significantly impact the system's performance, especially in safety-critical applications. For example, sensor failures, environmental dynamics, and multi-path interference can introduce significant errors in the data. To address these issues, researchers have developed methods like HyperDUM, which projects latent features into a hyperdimensional space to estimate feature-level epistemic uncertainty [2]. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the uncertainties associated with each modality, enabling the system to make more informed decisions and adapt to changing conditions.

Furthermore, the evaluation of uncertainty in multimodal data involves assessing both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties [4]. Aleatoric uncertainty is typically evaluated for its ability to handle ambiguous samples, while epistemic uncertainty is assessed for out-of-distribution (OoD) detection [4]. However, these evaluations can be challenging due to the interplay between the two types of uncertainty. For instance, in scenarios where the model predicts maximum aleatoric uncertainty, it may not be able to estimate epistemic uncertainty effectively [4]. This limitation highlights the need for comprehensive benchmarks and evaluation metrics that can accurately disentangle and quantify these uncertainties. By providing a well-supported set of experiments, researchers can better understand the strengths and weaknesses of different uncertainty quantification methods, ultimately leading to more robust and reliable multimodal systems.

# 5 Scalable and Robust Predictive Models

## 5.1 Spatial and Temporal Predictions

### 5.1.1 Spatially Constrained Bayesian Networks for Lithological Mapping
Spatially Constrained Bayesian Networks (SCB-Net) represent a significant advancement in predictive lithological mapping (PLM) by integrating the strengths of Bayesian inference with deep learning [25]. Unlike traditional deterministic neural networks, which often produce overconfident predictions and lack reliable uncertainty estimates, SCB-Net leverages Bayesian principles to quantify uncertainty in the predictions. This is particularly crucial in geoscience applications, where data scarcity and spatial heterogeneity are common, and accurate uncertainty quantification can significantly enhance the reliability of geological predictions.

The core of SCB-Net lies in its ability to incorporate spatial constraints into the Bayesian framework. By doing so, it addresses the challenge of spatial autocorrelation, a fundamental characteristic of geological data. The network is designed to learn spatial dependencies and patterns from the input data, such as satellite imagery and geophysical surveys, and to propagate this spatial information through the Bayesian layers. This results in more coherent and realistic predictions, as the model can better account for the spatial structure of the geological phenomena. Additionally, the spatial constraints help regularize the model, reducing overfitting and improving generalization to unseen areas.

To implement SCB-Net, we employ a combination of convolutional layers to extract spatial features and Bayesian layers to model the uncertainty in the predictions. The convolutional layers capture the local spatial patterns, while the Bayesian layers provide a probabilistic interpretation of the model's outputs. During training, the model learns a posterior distribution over the weights, allowing it to generate multiple predictions for each input, each with an associated uncertainty. This multi-prediction approach is particularly useful for decision-making in geological exploration, where understanding the confidence in the predictions can guide further data collection and resource allocation. The integration of spatial constraints ensures that the model's predictions are not only accurate but also spatially consistent, making SCB-Net a powerful tool for PLM.

### 5.1.2 Probabilistic 3D Direction Prediction
Probabilistic 3D direction prediction is a critical task in various applications, including robotics, computer vision, and autonomous systems, where accurate and reliable direction estimates are essential [26]. Traditional deterministic models, such as neural networks, often fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in direction predictions, leading to overconfident and potentially unreliable outputs. To address these limitations, probabilistic models have been developed to provide more robust and interpretable predictions. These models not only predict the direction but also quantify the uncertainty associated with the prediction, which is crucial for decision-making in uncertain environments.

One of the key challenges in probabilistic 3D direction prediction is accounting for the spherical geometry of the direction space, which is typically represented on the unit sphere \( S^2 \). Conventional probabilistic models, such as Gaussian distributions, are not suitable for this task due to their Euclidean assumptions. Instead, models that can handle directional data, such as the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution, are preferred [26]. The vMF distribution is a natural choice for modeling directions on \( S^2 \) because it can capture the concentration and orientation of the data points on the sphere. By parameterizing the vMF distribution, deep learning models can predict the mean direction and the concentration parameter, thereby providing a probabilistic estimate of the direction.

To implement this approach, a deep learning framework can be designed to output the parameters of the vMF distribution, which are then used to sample directions and compute the negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss during training. This loss function encourages the model to produce well-calibrated predictions that accurately reflect the uncertainty in the data. Empirical evaluations have demonstrated that this approach not only improves the accuracy of direction predictions but also enhances the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Furthermore, the probabilistic nature of the predictions facilitates better decision-making in applications where uncertainty quantification is crucial, such as in autonomous navigation and robotics.

### 5.1.3 Bayesian Neural Fields for Spatiotemporal Data
Bayesian Neural Fields (BNFs) for spatiotemporal data represent a powerful fusion of Bayesian inference and deep learning, designed to address the limitations of traditional Gaussian Processes (GPs) and deterministic neural networks (NNs). GPs are renowned for their ability to provide transparent and reliable uncertainty quantification, but they often suffer from scalability issues due to their reliance on kernel functions and the need to invert large covariance matrices. On the other hand, deterministic NNs excel in learning complex representations from high-dimensional data but typically produce overconfident predictions and lack robust uncertainty estimates. BNFs aim to bridge this gap by leveraging the strengths of both methodologies, offering a scalable and flexible framework for spatiotemporal data analysis.

In BNFs, the deep neural network component is used to map the input data into a high-dimensional feature space, where the Gaussian Process operates. This hybrid architecture allows the model to learn intricate patterns and dependencies in the data while maintaining the ability to quantify uncertainty effectively. The neural network acts as a feature extractor, transforming raw inputs into a form that is more amenable to GP modeling. By doing so, BNFs can handle large-scale datasets and complex spatiotemporal structures, which are common in applications such as environmental monitoring, climate science, and urban planning. The Bayesian framework ensures that the model can provide probabilistic predictions, which are crucial for decision-making processes in these domains.

Moreover, BNFs can be trained using variational inference techniques, which approximate the posterior distribution over the model parameters. This approach not only facilitates efficient training but also enables the model to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Aleatoric uncertainty, which arises from noise in the data, is modeled through the likelihood function, while epistemic uncertainty, reflecting the model's uncertainty about its parameters, is captured by the posterior distribution [7]. The combination of these uncertainties provides a comprehensive understanding of the model's confidence in its predictions, making BNFs particularly suitable for applications where reliable uncertainty estimates are essential. Additionally, the modular nature of BNFs allows for easy integration with other machine learning components, enhancing their versatility and applicability across various spatiotemporal data analysis tasks.

## 5.2 Advanced Uncertainty Quantification Techniques

### 5.2.1 Cold Posteriors in Probabilistic Neural Networks
The phenomenon of cold posteriors in probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) has emerged as a significant topic of interest, challenging the conventional understanding of Bayesian inference in deep learning. Cold posteriors refer to the empirical observation that Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) often achieve better predictive performance when the posterior distribution is tempered, i.e., when the likelihood is raised to a power less than one. This finding is counterintuitive, as it suggests that the standard Bayesian posterior, which balances the prior and likelihood, may not always be optimal for predictive tasks. The underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon remains an active area of research, with several hypotheses being proposed.

One hypothesis suggests that the cold posterior effect is a result of the mismatch between the prior and the true posterior distribution. In deep neural networks, the prior over the weights often does not capture the complex structure of the function space that the network can represent. As a result, the standard posterior may overfit to the training data, leading to poor generalization. By tempering the posterior, the model can effectively regularize itself, leading to better predictive performance. Another hypothesis posits that the cold posterior effect is a symptom of the optimization challenges in training BNNs. The high-dimensional and complex nature of the posterior distribution in deep networks can make it difficult for variational inference methods to find a good approximation [5]. Tempering the posterior can simplify the optimization landscape, making it easier to find a good solution.

Despite the empirical success of cold posteriors, their theoretical implications are still not fully understood. Some researchers argue that the cold posterior effect may indicate a fundamental limitation of the Bayesian framework in deep learning, suggesting that alternative approaches to uncertainty quantification may be necessary [27]. Others view the cold posterior as a practical heuristic that can improve the performance of BNNs without requiring a deep theoretical justification. Regardless of the underlying cause, the cold posterior effect highlights the need for further research into the interplay between prior specification, posterior approximation, and predictive performance in probabilistic neural networks. This ongoing investigation is crucial for advancing the reliability and robustness of uncertainty quantification in deep learning models.

### 5.2.2 POINT2 Framework for Polymer Informatics
The POINT2 framework represents a significant advancement in polymer informatics by integrating advanced machine learning techniques with domain-specific knowledge to enhance the prediction and design of polymer materials [24]. This framework is designed to address the inherent challenges in polymer informatics, such as the complexity and variability of polymer structures, which traditional methods often struggle to capture accurately [24]. POINT2 leverages deep learning architectures, particularly those capable of handling graph-structured data, to model the intricate relationships between polymer molecular structures and their properties. By representing polymers as graphs, where nodes correspond to atoms and edges to bonds, the framework can effectively capture the topological and chemical information essential for accurate property predictions.

One of the key features of the POINT2 framework is its ability to incorporate both local and global structural information through multi-scale feature extraction. This is achieved by employing graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that can aggregate information from neighboring atoms at different scales, allowing the model to learn hierarchical representations of polymer structures. This multi-scale approach is crucial for capturing the diverse and often non-linear relationships between polymer architecture and properties such as mechanical strength, thermal stability, and solubility. Furthermore, the framework includes a mechanism for uncertainty quantification, which is essential for reliable decision-making in materials design. By integrating Bayesian methods, POINT2 can provide probabilistic predictions that not only estimate the properties of interest but also quantify the confidence in these predictions.

The practical utility of the POINT2 framework is demonstrated through its application in various polymer design scenarios, including the optimization of polymer blends and the discovery of new materials with tailored properties. The framework's ability to handle large and complex datasets, combined with its robust uncertainty quantification, makes it a powerful tool for accelerating the development of advanced polymer materials. Additionally, the modular design of POINT2 allows for easy integration with existing computational workflows, facilitating its adoption by researchers and industry practitioners. Overall, the POINT2 framework represents a significant step forward in the field of polymer informatics, offering a versatile and reliable platform for the prediction and design of polymer materials.

### 5.2.3 Bayesian Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks
Bayesian Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (Bayesian-KANs) represent a significant advancement in neural network architecture by integrating Bayesian inference techniques with the principles of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem [28]. This theorem, which asserts that any multivariate continuous function can be decomposed into a finite sum of univariate functions and addition operations, provides a robust theoretical foundation for KANs. Bayesian-KANs extend this by replacing deterministic spline functions with probabilistic splines, allowing the network to capture and reflect uncertainty in its predictions through probability distributions over network parameters [27]. This probabilistic approach not only enhances the interpretability of the model but also provides a principled way to quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for applications requiring reliable decision-making under uncertainty [25].

The architecture of Bayesian-KANs builds upon the structured method of KANs, which combines univariate functions to approximate complex multivariate functions. By integrating Bayesian inference, Bayesian-KANs can learn the distributions of these univariate functions and their parameters, thereby providing a more nuanced and flexible model. This flexibility is particularly advantageous in scenarios where the underlying data distribution is complex or where the model needs to extrapolate beyond the training data. The probabilistic nature of Bayesian-KANs also allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge, which can be critical in data-scarce environments. The ability to update these priors with new data through Bayesian updating further enhances the adaptability and robustness of the model.

In practice, Bayesian-KANs have shown promise in various applications, including function approximation, regression, and classification tasks [27]. The use of probabilistic splines in Bayesian-KANs enables the model to capture non-linear relationships and complex interactions between input variables more effectively than traditional deterministic models [27]. Moreover, the uncertainty quantification provided by Bayesian-KANs can be used to inform decision-making processes, such as in active learning, where the model can strategically select the most informative data points to label [15]. This combination of theoretical rigor and practical utility positions Bayesian-KANs as a powerful tool in the field of machine learning, particularly for applications that require both high accuracy and reliable uncertainty estimates.

## 5.3 Application-Specific Models

### 5.3.1 Space Radiation Exposure Forecasting
Space Radiation Exposure Forecasting is a critical component in ensuring the safety and success of human and robotic space missions, particularly those venturing beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO). The primary sources of space radiation include galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar energetic particles (SEPs), which pose significant risks to both human health and spacecraft systems [29]. Accurate forecasting of these radiation levels is essential for mission planning, real-time decision-making, and the implementation of protective measures. Machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as powerful tools for this purpose, leveraging vast datasets from space-based and ground-based observatories. These models can predict radiation levels at different locations in the Solar System, providing essential information for mission safety [29].

The development of ML models for space radiation forecasting involves the integration of time-series data from multiple sources, such as the BioSentinel mission, which measures the radiation environment in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit, and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) missions, which provide X-ray measurements [29]. These datasets are complemented by solar dynamics observatory (SDO) data, which offers insights into the Sun's activity and its impact on space weather. Advanced ML algorithms, including deep learning and Gaussian processes (GPs), are employed to model the complex and dynamic nature of space radiation. GPs, in particular, are favored for their ability to provide reliable uncertainty estimates, which are crucial for risk assessment and decision-making in space missions.

Despite the potential of ML in space radiation forecasting, several challenges remain. These include the need for robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) to ensure that predictions are reliable and trustworthy, especially in scenarios where data coverage is limited or the models are extrapolating beyond their training data [4]. Additionally, the computational demands of training and deploying these models in real-time environments must be addressed to ensure practical applicability. Future research directions include the development of hybrid models that combine the strengths of ML with physics-based models, as well as the creation of comprehensive verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) frameworks to establish the reliability of these predictive tools [30].

### 5.3.2 Traversability Assessment for Autonomous Navigation
Traversability assessment is a critical component of autonomous navigation systems, particularly in challenging terrains such as those encountered in planetary exploration. Traditional approaches to traversability assessment often rely on geometric obstacle detection, which is effective in identifying large, static obstacles but falls short in assessing the dynamic and deformable nature of planetary surfaces. For instance, the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover's AutoNav system primarily uses stereo vision to detect and avoid rocks and other visible hazards. However, this approach is insufficient for evaluating the risk of wheel slip on fine-grained regolith, which can lead to significant mobility issues, as evidenced by the prolonged entrapment of the Opportunity rover in the Purgatory Dune [31].

To address these limitations, recent research has focused on integrating machine learning techniques, particularly Gaussian Processes (GPs) and deep learning models, to enhance traversability assessment. GPs are particularly well-suited for this task due to their ability to model uncertainty and provide probabilistic predictions. By learning from a limited set of ground-truth data, GPs can infer the likelihood of wheel slip and other mobility risks on unseen terrain. Deep learning models, on the other hand, can capture complex patterns in sensor data, such as terrain texture and surface roughness, which are indicative of traversability. Combining these approaches, deep kernel learning has emerged as a promising technique, allowing for the automatic extraction of relevant features and the modeling of uncertainty in a single framework.

However, the integration of these advanced techniques into autonomous navigation systems presents several challenges. One key challenge is the real-time computational requirements, as traversability assessment must be performed rapidly to support safe and efficient navigation. Additionally, the limited availability of labeled training data for specific planetary environments necessitates the development of data-efficient learning methods. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of planetary surfaces, including changes due to weathering and rover-induced disturbances, requires continuous adaptation of the traversability model. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the development of robust and reliable autonomous navigation systems capable of exploring diverse and challenging terrains.

### 5.3.3 Scalable Deep Kernel Learning
Scalable Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) represents a significant advancement in the integration of deep learning and Gaussian Processes (GPs), addressing the scalability issues inherent in traditional GPs. DKL leverages neural networks to map input data into a high-dimensional feature space, where a GP is then applied to model the function. This approach not only enhances the representational power of GPs but also allows for end-to-end learning of all model parameters, including both kernel hyperparameters and network parameters. The use of neural networks in DKL enables the model to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data, making it particularly suitable for large-scale datasets and high-dimensional input spaces.

In this section, we introduce a novel scalable deep kernel learning method, DKL using KAN (DKL-KAN), which serves as an alternative to the conventional DKL using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (DKL-MLP) [28]. DKL-KAN is designed to maintain the benefits of DKL while addressing the computational and scalability challenges associated with deep kernel learning [28]. We compare two configurations of DKL-KAN: one that matches the neuron and layer count of DKL-MLP, and another that has a similar number of trainable parameters. This comparative analysis ensures a rigorous evaluation of the performance and efficiency of DKL-KAN relative to DKL-MLP. The results demonstrate that DKL-KAN can achieve comparable or better performance with reduced computational overhead, making it a promising approach for large-scale applications.

Furthermore, the scalability of DKL-KAN is enhanced through the use of efficient approximation techniques and parallel computing strategies. These techniques, such as inducing point methods and stochastic variational inference, allow the model to handle large datasets by approximating the full GP with a smaller set of inducing points. The use of parallel computing further accelerates the training process, making DKL-KAN suitable for real-world applications where data volume and complexity are significant. The experimental results on various benchmark datasets highlight the effectiveness of DKL-KAN in achieving high accuracy and efficiency, positioning it as a valuable tool in the field of scalable deep kernel learning [28].

# 6 Future Directions


The current survey of predictive uncertainty estimation in machine learning highlights several limitations and gaps that warrant further attention. One of the primary challenges is the accurate and efficient quantification of uncertainty in high-dimensional and complex data environments. Existing methods often struggle with computational scalability, particularly when dealing with large datasets or real-time applications. Additionally, there is a need for more robust techniques to handle out-of-distribution (OOD) data and concept drift, which are common in dynamic and evolving environments. Current approaches, while effective in controlled settings, often fail to generalize well to unseen data or shifting distributions. Another gap lies in the integration of uncertainty quantification with fairness and ethical considerations, where models must not only be reliable but also fair and transparent in their predictions.

To address these limitations, several directions for future research are proposed. First, there is a need to develop more computationally efficient algorithms for uncertainty quantification. This could involve leveraging advanced sampling techniques, parallel computing, and hardware acceleration to reduce the computational burden of ensemble methods and Bayesian approaches. Additionally, research should focus on developing lightweight models that can provide reliable uncertainty estimates with minimal computational resources, making them suitable for edge devices and real-time applications.

Second, the development of adaptive and lifelong learning frameworks is crucial for handling OOD data and concept drift. These frameworks should be capable of dynamically adjusting their uncertainty estimates and learning strategies based on the evolving nature of the data. Techniques such as online learning, meta-learning, and continual learning can be explored to create models that are more resilient to changes in the data distribution. Furthermore, the integration of uncertainty quantification with active learning can help in efficiently acquiring labeled data for OOD detection and concept drift adaptation.

Third, there is a need to enhance the interpretability and explainability of uncertainty quantification methods. This is particularly important in high-stakes applications such as healthcare and autonomous systems, where the ability to understand and trust the model's predictions is essential. Research should focus on developing methods that can provide clear and actionable insights into the sources of uncertainty, such as aleatoric and epistemic components. Additionally, the visualization of uncertainty in complex models, such as deep neural networks, can aid in debugging and improving model performance.

The potential impact of the proposed future work is significant. More efficient and robust uncertainty quantification methods can lead to the development of more reliable and trustworthy machine learning models, particularly in safety-critical applications. Adaptive and lifelong learning frameworks can enhance the resilience of models to changing environments, reducing the need for frequent retraining and improving their long-term performance. Enhanced interpretability and explainability can foster greater user trust and acceptance of AI systems, ultimately leading to better decision-making and more effective use of machine learning in various domains. By addressing these gaps, future research can contribute to the broader goal of building more reliable, robust, and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems.
