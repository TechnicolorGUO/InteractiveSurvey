# 2 Introduction
The control of nonlinear systems is a fundamental challenge in modern engineering, with applications spanning robotics, automotive systems, aerospace, and process control [1]. Traditional control theory has largely focused on linear systems, where well-established methods such as Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Model Predictive Control (MPC) have been extensively studied and applied. However, many real-world systems exhibit nonlinear behaviors that cannot be accurately captured by linear models, necessitating the development of advanced control strategies. The increasing availability of data and the advancements in optimization techniques have opened new avenues for data-driven control, which leverages historical input-output data to design control policies without the need for explicit system models. This approach has the potential to significantly enhance the performance and robustness of control systems, particularly in scenarios where traditional model-based methods are insufficient or impractical.

This survey paper focuses on data-driven control of nonlinear systems via semidefinite programming (SDP). The paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the recent developments and methodologies in this field, highlighting the role of semidefinite programming in formulating and solving data-driven control problems. The integration of data-driven approaches with semidefinite programming offers a powerful framework for designing stabilizing controllers, optimizing performance, and ensuring robustness in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. The paper also explores the application of these techniques in various domains, including closed-loop learning, predictive control, and robust control, and discusses the challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving area.

The paper begins by examining the use of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) for data-driven stabilization, where LMIs are employed to synthesize stabilizing controllers directly from input-output data [2]. This section highlights the advantages of LMIs in converting complex control design problems into convex optimization problems, which can be efficiently solved using standard algorithms. The discussion then extends to the integration of prior knowledge with data-driven approaches in closed-loop learning, where methodologies such as matrix zonotopes and equality conformity constraints are used to ensure the explainability and reliability of the learned control policies. The paper also delves into data-driven predictive control for nonlinear systems, focusing on the use of machine learning algorithms to approximate system dynamics and the integration of these models with MPC frameworks [3].

Next, the paper explores the role of semidefinite programming in enhancing the robustness and safety of control systems. This includes the use of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to enforce safety constraints, the application of interval observers for systems with unknown dynamics, and the development of safe data-driven predictive control strategies.

Additionally, the paper addresses the critical issue of attack detection and mitigation in data-driven control systems, highlighting the use of anomaly detection and resilient control algorithms to ensure the reliability and security of these systems [4].

Finally, the paper examines the role of optimization techniques and algorithms in data-driven control, including mixed integer nonlinear programming, sensitivity analysis, and convex optimization. The discussion covers the use of successive convex approximation for energy efficiency, semidefinite relaxation for UAV-RIS networks, and continuous optimization for controller placement. The paper also explores the application of the Koopman operator and machine learning in real-time estimation and control, with a focus on adaptive optics telemetry, power module temperature estimation, and dictionary-free Koopman model predictive control.

# 3 Stochastic and Data-Driven Control Strategies

## 3.1 Data-Driven Stabilization and Control

### 3.1.1 Linear Matrix Inequalities for Stabilization
Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) play a pivotal role in the design of stabilizing controllers for linear systems, providing a systematic approach to derive feedback gains that ensure system stability. LMIs are particularly useful in the context of Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) design, where they can be formulated to find the optimal control law that minimizes a quadratic cost function. The key advantage of using LMIs lies in their ability to convert complex control design problems into convex optimization problems, which can be efficiently solved using standard algorithms such as interior-point methods. This transformation not only simplifies the design process but also guarantees the existence of a solution under certain conditions, making LMIs a powerful tool in control theory.

In the context of data-driven control, LMIs can be employed to synthesize stabilizing controllers directly from input-output data, bypassing the need for an explicit system model. By representing the system dynamics in a data-driven form, the stabilization problem can be cast as an LMI feasibility problem, where the goal is to find a set of gain matrices that ensure the closed-loop system is stable. This approach leverages the rich structure of LMIs to incorporate various constraints, such as actuator limitations and performance specifications, directly into the design process. The resulting controllers are robust to model uncertainties and can adapt to changing system dynamics, making them suitable for a wide range of practical applications.

Moreover, the use of LMIs in stabilization extends beyond linear systems to include certain classes of nonlinear systems through techniques such as linear parameter-varying (LPV) control and gain-scheduled control. In these cases, the system is approximated by a family of linear models, and LMIs are used to design controllers that stabilize the entire family of models. This approach ensures that the closed-loop system remains stable over a range of operating conditions, enhancing the overall robustness and performance of the control system. The flexibility and computational tractability of LMIs make them an indispensable tool in modern control design, particularly in scenarios where traditional model-based methods may be insufficient or impractical.

### 3.1.2 Closed-Loop Learning with Prior Knowledge
In the realm of closed-loop learning, integrating prior knowledge with data-driven approaches has emerged as a critical strategy to enhance system performance and robustness, especially in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties [5]. This section focuses on methodologies that leverage both data and prior knowledge to improve the learning process, ensuring that the learned control policies are not only optimal but also safe and reliable. The primary challenge in this domain is to effectively incorporate the available prior knowledge, which can range from system model parameters to physical constraints, into the learning framework without compromising the adaptability and flexibility of data-driven methods.

To address this challenge, a matrix zonotope representation is often used to encapsulate the set of all possible closed-loop systems that are consistent with the prior knowledge and observed data [5]. This representation allows for the formalization of constraints that ensure the explainability of the closed-loop system models by the prior knowledge. Specifically, equality conformity constraints are introduced to align the data-driven models with the known system dynamics, thereby reducing the conservatism and improving the accuracy of the learned models. This approach not only enhances the robustness of the control system but also mitigates the impact of noise and disturbances by filtering out inconsistent models.

Furthermore, the integration of prior knowledge into the learning process can significantly improve the performance of closed-loop learning algorithms, particularly in scenarios where data is limited or noisy. By leveraging the known system dynamics, the learning algorithm can focus on refining the parameters that are most uncertain or critical, leading to more efficient and effective learning. This is particularly important in safety-critical applications, where the reliability and predictability of the control system are paramount. The use of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to formulate stabilization conditions further ensures that the resulting control policies are stable and robust, even in the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances.

### 3.1.3 Data-Driven Predictive Control for Nonlinear Systems
Data-Driven Predictive Control (DDPC) for nonlinear systems represents a significant advancement in control theory, addressing the limitations of traditional model-based approaches [3]. Unlike classical Model Predictive Control (MPC), which relies on an accurate and often complex dynamical model, DDPC leverages historical input-output data to learn the system's behavior directly. This approach is particularly advantageous for nonlinear systems where obtaining an exact model is either impractical or computationally prohibitive. By circumventing the need for explicit model identification, DDPC can rapidly adapt to changes in system dynamics and operate effectively in real-time scenarios.

One of the key techniques in DDPC for nonlinear systems is the use of data-driven models that approximate the system's behavior using machine learning algorithms. These models, such as neural networks or Gaussian processes, can capture the intricate nonlinearities and uncertainties inherent in the system. The integration of these data-driven models with MPC frameworks allows for the formulation of optimization problems that account for the learned dynamics. This hybrid approach not only enhances the predictive accuracy but also ensures that the control actions are optimized for performance and stability. Moreover, the use of data-driven models can improve the robustness of the control system by handling unmodeled dynamics and disturbances more effectively.

To further enhance the capabilities of DDPC for nonlinear systems, recent research has focused on combining data-driven models with partial knowledge of the system's structure. This semi-data-driven approach, known as Semi-Data-Driven Model Predictive Control (SD-MPC), integrates a parametric model with a data-driven component [6]. The parametric model captures the known aspects of the system, while the data-driven component accounts for the residual uncertainties and nonlinearities. This combination leverages the strengths of both model-based and data-driven methods, resulting in a more resilient and adaptable control strategy. SD-MPC has demonstrated superior performance in handling complex nonlinear systems, particularly in applications such as robotics, automotive control, and process industries, where precise and reliable control is crucial.

## 3.2 Robustness and Safety in Control Systems

### 3.2.1 Control Barrier Functions for Safety Constraints
Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as a critical tool in ensuring the safety of control systems, particularly in safety-critical applications where maintaining system constraints is paramount [7]. CBFs are designed to guarantee the forward invariance of a safe set, ensuring that the system state remains within predefined safety boundaries at all times [8]. This is achieved by formulating a constraint that can be integrated into the control policy, typically through a quadratic program (QP). The key advantage of CBFs is their ability to enforce safety constraints in real-time, making them suitable for dynamic and uncertain environments.

Adaptive Control Barrier Functions (ACBFs) and Robust Control Barrier Functions (RCBFs) have been developed to address the challenges posed by system uncertainties, such as state estimation errors, model mismatches, and unknown disturbances [7]. ACBFs adapt to the system's changing dynamics, ensuring that the safety constraints remain valid even as the system evolves. RCBFs, on the other hand, are designed to be robust against a wide range of uncertainties, providing a more conservative but reliable approach to safety. These frameworks often involve the use of Lyapunov-like functions to ensure stability and safety simultaneously, making them particularly useful in complex systems where both performance and safety are critical.

The integration of CBFs with other control techniques, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), has further enhanced their applicability and effectiveness. In this hybrid approach, MPC is used to solve a finite-horizon optimization problem at each time step, while CBFs are employed to enforce safety constraints. This combination allows for the optimization of control actions while ensuring that the system remains within safe operational limits. The resulting control policies are not only optimal but also robust to disturbances and uncertainties, making them well-suited for a wide range of applications, from autonomous vehicles to industrial control systems.

### 3.2.2 Interval Observers for Unknown Dynamics
Interval observers for unknown dynamics represent a significant advancement in the field of control systems, particularly for scenarios where the exact model of the system is not fully known or is subject to uncertainties. The core idea behind interval observers is to construct tight and tractable bounds for the unknown dynamics as a function of current and past interval framers [9]. This approach allows for the systematic integration of these bounds into the observer system, thereby extending observer design methodologies from systems with fully known yet noisy dynamics to those with partially unknown dynamics. By leveraging data-driven over-approximation and abstraction of unknown dynamics, a recursive framework is developed that refines the estimation of the unknown system components using noisy observation data and interval estimates [9].

The construction of interval observers for unknown dynamics involves several key steps. First, the system is modeled using a combination of known dynamics and an unknown component, which is represented by an interval framework. This interval framework captures the possible range of values that the unknown dynamics can take, based on historical data and current observations. The observer design then incorporates these interval bounds into the state estimation process, ensuring that the estimated states remain within the bounds of the true system states. This is achieved through the use of interval arithmetic and set-theoretic methods, which allow for the propagation of uncertainty through the system dynamics. The resulting observer is robust to model uncertainties and can provide reliable state estimates even in the presence of significant disturbances or unmodeled dynamics.

Furthermore, the application of interval observers to systems with unknown dynamics has been demonstrated in various contexts, including linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems, and nonlinear systems [9]. In LTI systems, interval observers have been shown to effectively handle model uncertainties and provide robust state estimation, even when the system parameters are not precisely known. For LPV systems, the interval observer design is adapted to account for parameter variations, ensuring that the observer remains effective over a range of operating conditions. In nonlinear systems, the interval observer framework is extended to handle the complex and time-varying nature of the dynamics, providing a powerful tool for state estimation in a wide range of applications. The robustness and adaptability of interval observers make them a valuable addition to the toolkit of control engineers working with systems characterized by significant uncertainties.

### 3.2.3 Safe Data-Driven Predictive Control
Safe Data-Driven Predictive Control (DDPC) is a critical area of research that addresses the challenge of ensuring system safety and performance in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances. Unlike traditional model-based predictive control (MPC) approaches, which rely on accurate system models, DDPC leverages data to learn and adapt the control policy in real-time. This section explores the methodologies and techniques that enhance the robustness and safety of data-driven predictive control systems, particularly in the context of nonlinear systems and real-world applications.

One of the key techniques in safe DDPC is the integration of control barrier functions (CBFs) to enforce safety constraints. CBFs are designed to ensure that the system states remain within a predefined safe set, thereby guaranteeing forward invariance and asymptotic stability [8]. By formulating the control problem as an optimization task that incorporates CBF constraints, DDPC can effectively handle uncertainties and disturbances while maintaining system safety. This approach is particularly useful in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and aerospace systems, where the failure to meet safety constraints can have severe consequences.

Another important aspect of safe DDPC is the use of concurrent learning and adaptive control methods to continuously update the system model and control policy. Concurrent learning, for instance, uses a memory of past data to satisfy the rank condition required for system identification, allowing for real-time adaptation to changes in the system dynamics. This is particularly advantageous in scenarios where the system is subject to time-varying dynamics or external disturbances. By combining these adaptive techniques with model predictive control, the resulting framework can achieve both high performance and robust safety guarantees, making it suitable for a wide range of complex and dynamic systems.

## 3.3 Distributed and Collaborative Control

### 3.3.1 Collaborative Multi-UAV Model Predictive Control
Collaborative Multi-UAV Model Predictive Control (MPC) represents a sophisticated approach to managing multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in complex, dynamic environments, particularly in maritime settings where the tracking of multiple targets is crucial [10]. In this framework, the MPC is formulated as a Nonlinear Mixed Integer Program (NMIP) to optimize the control inputs of each UAV in real-time, ensuring that the overall system minimizes tracking errors and state uncertainties. The NMIP formulation allows for the inclusion of constraints such as collision avoidance, fuel consumption, and communication range, which are essential for the safe and efficient operation of a multi-UAV system.

The collaborative aspect of this MPC framework is particularly noteworthy, as it leverages the collective capabilities of the UAV fleet to improve the accuracy and reliability of target tracking. By coordinating the trajectories of multiple UAVs, the system can dynamically adjust to changes in the environment, such as the movement of targets or the appearance of new obstacles. This is achieved through a receding planning horizon, where the control inputs are continuously updated based on the latest state estimates and predictions. The integration of state estimation techniques, such as Kalman filters or particle filters, further enhances the system's ability to maintain accurate and up-to-date information about the targets' positions and velocities.

Moreover, the proposed collaborative MPC framework addresses specific challenges unique to maritime environments, such as the dispersion and coalescence of targets [10]. By directing UAVs to strategic locations that maximize the information gain, the system can effectively reduce the posterior covariance of target states, leading to more precise and robust tracking [10]. This approach not only improves the overall performance of the UAV fleet but also enhances the system's resilience to uncertainties and disturbances, making it suitable for a wide range of real-world applications, including search and rescue operations, environmental monitoring, and maritime security.

### 3.3.2 Distributed Resource Allocation for Communication Networks
Distributed resource allocation in communication networks is a critical aspect of ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission, especially in complex and dynamic environments such as those found in modern wireless networks. The primary challenge lies in dynamically allocating resources, such as bandwidth, power, and time slots, to multiple users or devices in a manner that maximizes overall network performance while adhering to constraints such as fairness, quality of service (QoS), and interference management. This section explores various approaches and techniques used in distributed resource allocation, focusing on their theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and recent advancements.

One prominent approach to distributed resource allocation is the use of game-theoretic models, which treat the allocation problem as a strategic interaction among multiple agents. Each agent, representing a user or a device, aims to optimize its own utility function, which could be related to throughput, latency, or energy consumption. Nash equilibrium concepts are often employed to analyze the stability and efficiency of the resulting resource allocation. However, achieving a globally optimal allocation through decentralized decision-making can be challenging due to the non-convexity and coupling of individual utility functions. To address these issues, iterative algorithms such as best response dynamics and gradient ascent methods have been developed to converge to a near-optimal solution.

Another important technique in distributed resource allocation is the application of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. These approaches leverage historical data and real-time network conditions to predict future demands and adaptively allocate resources. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, in particular, have shown promise in dynamically adjusting resource allocations based on feedback from the network environment. RL agents can learn optimal policies through trial and error, balancing exploration and exploitation to achieve high performance. Additionally, deep learning models can be used to predict traffic patterns and identify potential bottlenecks, enabling proactive resource management. The integration of ML and AI into distributed resource allocation not only enhances the adaptability and responsiveness of the network but also improves its resilience to dynamic changes and unforeseen events.

### 3.3.3 Attack Detection and Mitigation in Data-Driven Control
Attack detection and mitigation in data-driven control systems is a critical area of research due to the increasing reliance on data-driven methods in control applications [4]. These systems, while offering significant benefits in terms of adaptability and performance, are vulnerable to various types of adversarial attacks, including data injection, denial-of-service (DoS), and model poisoning. Such attacks can compromise the integrity and safety of the controlled system, leading to suboptimal performance or even catastrophic failures. Therefore, developing robust detection and mitigation strategies is essential to ensure the reliability and security of data-driven control systems.

Recent studies have explored various approaches to detect and mitigate attacks in data-driven control systems [4]. One prominent method is the use of anomaly detection techniques, which leverage statistical and machine learning models to identify deviations from normal system behavior. These techniques can be applied to both input and output data streams to detect anomalies that may indicate an attack. For instance, methods based on control barrier functions (CBFs) have been proposed to ensure the safety of the system by maintaining the system state within a predefined safe set, even in the presence of attacks [8]. CBFs can be integrated into the control law as constraints, allowing for real-time adaptation and ensuring that the system remains within safe operational limits.

Another approach to attack detection and mitigation involves the development of resilient control algorithms that can operate effectively under adversarial conditions. Resilient control strategies often combine data-driven models with traditional control techniques to enhance the system's ability to withstand and recover from attacks. For example, semi-data-driven control methods integrate prior model information with data-driven models to capture the fundamental dynamics of the system while adapting to unknown or changing conditions. These hybrid approaches can provide enhanced robustness and fault tolerance, making them suitable for safety-critical applications. Additionally, the use of set-valued data-driven methods, which abstract or over-approximate unknown dynamics, can help in designing controllers that are resilient to a wide range of uncertainties and attacks [9].

# 4 Optimization Techniques and Algorithms

## 4.1 Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming and Constraint Programming

### 4.1.1 Linearization of Nonlinear Constraints
Linearization of nonlinear constraints is a fundamental technique in optimization, particularly when dealing with mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. The primary goal of linearization is to transform nonlinear constraints into a set of linear constraints, thereby enabling the use of efficient linear programming (LP) solvers. This transformation is crucial because LP solvers are generally faster and more reliable than their nonlinear counterparts, especially for large-scale problems. One common approach to linearization involves piecewise linear approximations, where the nonlinear function is approximated by a series of linear segments. This method is particularly effective for convex functions, as it ensures that the approximation remains within a bounded error margin.

Another widely used technique is the introduction of auxiliary variables and constraints to reformulate the nonlinear constraints. For instance, bilinear terms can be linearized by introducing additional variables and constraints that capture the product of the original variables. This approach is often combined with branch-and-bound methods to ensure global optimality. The effectiveness of this method depends on the structure of the nonlinear constraints and the tightness of the resulting linear relaxation. In some cases, specialized linearization techniques, such as McCormick envelopes, are employed to provide tighter bounds and improve the quality of the linear approximation.

Finally, the linearization of nonlinear constraints can also be achieved through the use of logarithmic and exponential transformations, particularly when dealing with multiplicative or exponential terms. These transformations can convert nonlinear constraints into linear or convex forms, making them amenable to standard optimization techniques. However, the choice of linearization method must be carefully considered, as it can significantly impact the computational efficiency and solution quality of the optimization problem. The selection of the most appropriate method often depends on the specific characteristics of the problem, such as the type of nonlinearities and the desired level of accuracy.

### 4.1.2 Evolutionary Algorithms for Nonlinear Boolean Functions
Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have emerged as powerful tools for optimizing nonlinear Boolean functions, particularly in scenarios where the search space is vast and the problem is inherently nonconvex [11]. These algorithms mimic natural selection and genetics, enabling them to explore the solution space effectively and avoid local optima. For nonlinear Boolean functions, EAs are particularly useful because they can handle the discrete and combinatorial nature of the problem. Genetic algorithms (GAs), a subclass of EAs, are among the most widely used methods due to their simplicity and robustness [11]. GAs operate by encoding potential solutions as chromosomes, applying genetic operators such as crossover and mutation, and selecting the fittest individuals for the next generation.

In the context of nonlinear Boolean functions, the primary challenge lies in the efficient exploration of the solution space, especially for functions with a large number of variables. To address this, researchers have developed specialized variants of GAs that incorporate domain-specific knowledge. For instance, prior population-based GAs have been proposed, which utilize information from previous generations to guide the search process. This approach not only accelerates convergence but also helps in maintaining diversity within the population, thereby enhancing the algorithm's ability to find high-quality solutions. Additionally, hybrid coding schemes have been employed to represent both the controller placement and switch assignment strategies within a single chromosome, allowing for a more integrated optimization process.

Another significant advancement in the application of EAs to nonlinear Boolean functions is the integration of heuristic techniques and local search methods. These hybrid approaches combine the global exploration capabilities of EAs with the fine-tuning abilities of local search algorithms, leading to improved solution quality and faster convergence. For example, the sequential partial penalization technique has been shown to outperform traditional derivative-free methods such as grid, random, and Bayesian search [12]. Furthermore, the use of prior populations to link the strategy-solving processes for adjacent time slots facilitates the consideration of strategy-shifting costs and achieves continuous optimization, making these algorithms particularly suitable for dynamic environments [13].

### 4.1.3 Resource Allocation in Semantic-Oriented Communication
In the realm of semantic-oriented communication (SOC), resource allocation is a critical component that directly influences the system's performance in terms of semantic similarity, delay, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [14]. Unlike traditional communication systems, where resources are allocated based on physical layer metrics such as bit error rate (BER) or throughput, SOC systems prioritize the semantic content of the transmitted information. This shift necessitates a new framework for resource allocation that can dynamically adapt to the varying semantic requirements of different applications and users. The proposed framework in this section aims to address these challenges by jointly optimizing the allocation of resources, such as bandwidth, power, and time slots, to maximize semantic similarity while meeting other performance constraints [14].

To achieve this, the framework introduces the concept of semantic similarity ranges, which allows the system to flexibly adjust the quality of the transmitted information based on the available resources and the current network conditions. By defining these ranges, the system can prioritize the transmission of more critical information during times of resource scarcity, ensuring that the most important data is accurately conveyed. This approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios with high user density or limited bandwidth, where traditional resource allocation methods may fail to meet the diverse needs of all users. Moreover, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that continuously monitors the network state and updates the allocation strategy to maintain optimal performance.

The benefits of this semantic-aware resource allocation approach are multifaceted [14]. For instance, in applications requiring complete data reconstruction, such as real-time video streaming or virtual reality, the system can allocate more resources to ensure high semantic similarity and minimize delay. Conversely, in task-specific applications, where the goal is to achieve a specific objective rather than perfect data reconstruction, the system can allocate resources more efficiently by focusing on the most relevant information. This adaptability not only enhances the overall user experience but also improves the network's resource utilization, leading to more sustainable and efficient communication systems.

## 4.2 Sensitivity Analysis and Stability

### 4.2.1 Sensitivity Analysis for Parametric Nonlinear Programming
Sensitivity analysis in parametric nonlinear programming (NLP) is a critical tool for understanding how changes in problem parameters affect the optimal solution. This analysis is particularly important in practical applications where parameters such as costs, constraints, and resource availability are subject to uncertainty. The primary focus of sensitivity analysis in NLP is to determine the stability and robustness of the optimal solution under small perturbations of the parameters. This involves analyzing the behavior of the solution set and the optimal value function as the parameters vary.

In the context of parametric NLP, sensitivity analysis often relies on the concept of the Lagrange multipliers and the KKT (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker) conditions. The Lagrange multipliers provide a measure of the sensitivity of the optimal value to changes in the constraints. By examining the derivatives of the Lagrange multipliers with respect to the parameters, one can derive conditions under which the optimal solution remains stable or changes discontinuously. This is particularly useful in identifying critical points where the solution structure may change, such as when a constraint becomes active or inactive.

Moreover, advanced techniques such as the implicit function theorem and the concept of the critical cone are employed to provide a deeper understanding of the solution's behavior. The implicit function theorem allows for the local approximation of the optimal solution as a function of the parameters, facilitating the computation of sensitivity coefficients. The critical cone, on the other hand, helps in identifying the directions in the parameter space that lead to changes in the active set of constraints. Together, these tools provide a comprehensive framework for conducting sensitivity analysis in parametric NLP, enabling practitioners to make informed decisions in the face of parameter uncertainty.

### 4.2.2 Master Stability Function for Synchronization
The Master Stability Function (MSF) is a powerful analytical tool used to assess the stability of synchronized states in complex dynamical networks [15]. Originally introduced by Pecora and Carroll, the MSF method leverages the concept of Lyapunov exponents to determine the stability of a synchronized state under varying coupling strengths and network topologies. The MSF is defined as a function that maps the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix to the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the linearized system around the synchronized state. By evaluating the MSF, one can identify the range of coupling strengths for which synchronization is stable, thereby providing a comprehensive criterion for achieving and maintaining synchronization in complex networks [15].

The MSF approach has been widely applied to both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, offering insights into the synchronization properties of various network structures, including regular, random, and scale-free networks. One of the key advantages of the MSF method is its ability to decouple the stability analysis from the specific dynamics of individual nodes, focusing instead on the collective behavior of the network. This makes the MSF particularly useful for studying large-scale networks where the individual node dynamics may be complex and heterogeneous. Moreover, the MSF can be extended to analyze partial synchronization, cluster synchronization, and other forms of collective behavior, making it a versatile tool in the study of complex systems [15].

Recent advancements in the MSF methodology have focused on extending its applicability to more realistic network models, such as those with time delays, adaptive couplings, and stochastic perturbations. These extensions have broadened the scope of the MSF, enabling its application to a wider range of real-world systems, including biological networks, power grids, and communication networks. Additionally, the development of numerical algorithms for computing the MSF has made it more accessible to researchers and practitioners, facilitating its integration into various modeling and control frameworks. Despite these advances, challenges remain in applying the MSF to highly non-linear and non-stationary systems, where the assumptions underlying the MSF may not hold, necessitating further theoretical and computational developments.

### 4.2.3 Sum of Squares Programming for Synchronization Criteria
Sum of Squares (SOS) programming has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing and ensuring synchronization in complex dynamical networks. By leveraging the algebraic structure of polynomial systems, SOS programming can provide rigorous certificates of stability and synchronization criteria. The approach involves formulating the synchronization problem as a polynomial optimization problem, where the objective is to find a Lyapunov function that guarantees the stability of the synchronous state. This is achieved by expressing the Lyapunov function as a sum of squares of polynomials, which ensures its non-negativity and thus the stability of the system.

The key advantage of SOS programming in this context is its ability to handle non-linear dynamics and complex coupling structures, which are common in many real-world networks. By converting the synchronization problem into a convex optimization problem, SOS programming can efficiently compute the required Lyapunov functions and synchronization conditions. This method is particularly useful for systems where traditional linearization techniques may not provide accurate or sufficient information. Furthermore, the use of semidefinite programming (SDP) solvers allows for the computation of these conditions in a computationally tractable manner, even for large-scale networks.

However, the effectiveness of SOS programming for synchronization criteria is contingent on the choice of polynomial basis and the degree of the Lyapunov function. Higher-degree polynomials can capture more complex dynamics but at the cost of increased computational complexity. Therefore, a balance must be struck between the accuracy of the synchronization criteria and the computational feasibility of the optimization problem. Recent advances in SOS programming have focused on developing efficient algorithms and heuristics to reduce the computational burden, making it more applicable to practical scenarios involving large and heterogeneous networks.

## 4.3 Convex Optimization and Relaxation Techniques

### 4.3.1 Successive Convex Approximation for Energy Efficiency
Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing energy efficiency in complex communication systems, particularly in scenarios involving non-convex optimization problems. The core idea of SCA is to iteratively approximate the non-convex problem with a sequence of convex subproblems, each of which can be solved efficiently. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where direct optimization of the original problem is infeasible due to its non-convex nature. For instance, in the context of RIS-assisted massive MIMO systems, SCA has been successfully applied to optimize the transmit power and RIS reflection coefficients, thereby enhancing the harvested energy and overall energy efficiency of the system [16].

The effectiveness of SCA in energy efficiency optimization is largely attributed to its ability to handle constraints and variables that are inherently non-convex. By carefully constructing convex approximations at each iteration, SCA can converge to a solution that is close to the global optimum, even in the presence of non-convex constraints. This is particularly important in resource allocation problems, where the objective is to minimize energy consumption while maintaining performance metrics such as data rate and reliability. For example, in the hybrid energy-harvesting resource allocation (HERA) strategy, SCA is used to optimize the operation of UAV-RIS units by considering the irregular ON/OFF capability of RIS elements and the non-linear time-switching (TS) radio frequency (RF) and rectenna (RE) harvesting processes. The iterative nature of SCA allows for the dynamic adjustment of these parameters, leading to prolonged operational times and improved energy efficiency.

Moreover, SCA can be integrated with other optimization techniques to further enhance its performance. For instance, combining SCA with semidefinite relaxation (SDR) or genetic algorithms (GA) can provide a more robust and efficient solution framework. SDR can be used to relax the non-convex constraints into a convex form, making the problem more tractable for SCA. On the other hand, GA can be employed to explore the solution space more thoroughly, especially in high-dimensional problems where the initial convex approximations may not be accurate. This hybrid approach not only improves the convergence rate but also ensures that the solution is close to the global optimum, making SCA a versatile and effective tool for energy efficiency optimization in a wide range of communication systems.

### 4.3.2 Semidefinite Relaxation for UAV-RIS Networks
Semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for solving non-convex optimization problems in UAV-RIS networks, particularly those involving complex constraints such as radio frequency energy harvesting (RF EH) non-linearity, channel state information (CSI) imperfections, and hardware impairments (HIs). By relaxing the original non-convex problem into a convex semidefinite program (SDP), SDR enables the derivation of near-optimal solutions that are computationally tractable. This approach leverages the structure of the problem to transform the original constraints into a form that can be efficiently handled by convex optimization solvers, thus providing a practical means to enhance the energy efficiency and resilience of UAV-RIS-assisted communication networks.

In the context of UAV-RIS networks, SDR is particularly useful for optimizing the deployment and operation of UAVs and RIS elements. For instance, the placement of RIS units and the trajectory planning of UAVs can be formulated as a joint optimization problem, where the objective is to maximize the energy efficiency while ensuring reliable communication links. The non-convex nature of this problem, often exacerbated by the presence of multiple constraints, makes it challenging to solve using traditional optimization methods. SDR overcomes these challenges by relaxing the binary or integer variables associated with RIS placement and UAV trajectories into continuous variables, thereby converting the problem into a convex SDP. The relaxed solution can then be used to derive a feasible solution to the original problem through rounding techniques or other post-processing methods.

Moreover, the application of SDR in UAV-RIS networks extends beyond just placement and trajectory optimization. It can also be applied to the design of beamforming vectors and power allocation schemes, which are crucial for maximizing the energy efficiency and throughput of the network. By formulating these problems as SDPs, SDR allows for the simultaneous optimization of multiple performance metrics, such as signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and energy consumption, under various practical constraints. This holistic approach ensures that the resulting solutions are not only optimal but also robust to real-world imperfections, making SDR a valuable technique for advancing the state-of-the-art in UAV-RIS-assisted communication systems [16].

### 4.3.3 Continuous Optimization for Controller Placement
Continuous optimization for controller placement is a critical aspect of network management, particularly in dynamic environments where the optimal configuration can significantly impact performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and reliability. The primary challenge in this domain is to determine the optimal positions of controllers and their associated switches over time, considering the dynamic nature of network traffic and the constraints imposed by the physical infrastructure. This problem can be formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC), which captures the interdependencies between controller placement and network performance. The MPCC framework allows for the modeling of nonconvex and nonlinear relationships, making it suitable for addressing the complexities inherent in real-world network scenarios.

To solve the MPCC problem for controller placement, various optimization techniques have been proposed, including sequential inexact penalization and relaxation methods. These methods iteratively refine the placement and assignment strategies by penalizing violations of the complementarity constraints and relaxing the problem to make it more tractable. The key advantage of these approaches is their ability to handle large-scale networks and dynamic changes in traffic patterns. However, the effectiveness of these methods depends on the choice of penalty parameters and the relaxation strategies employed. Recent advancements have focused on developing adaptive algorithms that can dynamically adjust these parameters based on the current state of the network, thereby improving convergence and solution quality.

Visualization tools play a crucial role in the evaluation and refinement of controller placement strategies [13]. These tools provide insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of the network, enabling network administrators to identify bottlenecks and optimize the placement of controllers and switches. For instance, visualizations can highlight the impact of different placement strategies on network performance metrics, such as the distribution of latency and the utilization of network resources. Experimental evaluations have shown that the proposed continuous optimization algorithms outperform static placement strategies, especially in scenarios with high variability in traffic patterns. Furthermore, the impact of the number of controllers and the weighting of different performance metrics on the overall network performance has been analyzed, providing guidelines for the practical implementation of these optimization techniques.

# 5 Koopman Operator and Machine Learning Applications

## 5.1 Koopman Operator for Nonlinear Dynamics

### 5.1.1 Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition for HVAC Systems
Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD) is a powerful data-driven technique that has been increasingly applied to model and control complex systems, including Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems [17]. Unlike traditional modeling approaches that rely on first-principles, eDMD leverages time-series data to construct a linear approximation of the underlying nonlinear dynamics. This is achieved by lifting the original state variables into a higher-dimensional space using a dictionary of basis functions, which allows the nonlinear system to be represented as a linear system in the lifted space. The linear Koopman operator, derived from this lifted representation, provides a tractable framework for analyzing and controlling the system's behavior.

In the context of HVAC systems, eDMD offers several advantages. First, it enables the identification of dominant modes and their associated frequencies, which can provide insights into the system's transient and steady-state behaviors. This is particularly useful for optimizing the control strategies to enhance energy efficiency and comfort levels. Second, the linear nature of the Koopman operator simplifies the design of control laws, making it easier to implement real-time control algorithms [1]. For instance, eDMD can be integrated with Model Predictive Control (MPC) to predict future states and optimize control actions based on these predictions. This integration is crucial for managing the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of HVAC systems, especially in large buildings where multiple zones and environmental factors must be considered.

However, the effectiveness of eDMD in HVAC applications depends on the choice of basis functions and the quality of the data used for training. Selecting an appropriate dictionary is a non-trivial task, as it needs to capture the essential features of the system dynamics while remaining computationally efficient. Moreover, the data must be representative of the system's operating conditions, including variations in load, occupancy, and external weather conditions. Despite these challenges, recent advances in machine learning and data preprocessing techniques have shown promise in automating the selection of basis functions and improving the robustness of eDMD models. As a result, eDMD is becoming an increasingly viable tool for enhancing the performance of HVAC systems through advanced data-driven control strategies.

### 5.1.2 Koopman Operator with Event-Triggered Control
The integration of the Koopman Operator with Event-Triggered Control (ETC) represents a significant advancement in the control of nonlinear systems [18]. By leveraging the Koopman Operator, which lifts the nonlinear dynamics into a higher-dimensional linear space, this approach enables the design of efficient and robust control strategies [1]. The key idea is to approximate the nonlinear system dynamics with a linear model in a lifted state space, where traditional linear control techniques can be applied. This approximation is particularly useful for systems where real-time computation and resource efficiency are critical, such as in emergency vehicle operations under low-visibility conditions.

In the context of event-triggered control, the Koopman Operator-based approach (KOETC) offers a data-driven method to design both the controller and the triggering policy [18]. The event-triggering policy is designed to minimize unnecessary control updates, thereby reducing communication and computational overhead [18]. This is achieved by updating the control actions only when the system state deviates significantly from the predicted trajectory, as determined by the Koopman-lifted linear model. The state-feedback controller, on the other hand, stabilizes the system by utilizing the linearized dynamics in the lifted space. This combination ensures that the system remains stable and responsive while minimizing resource consumption, which is crucial for real-time applications.

However, the effectiveness of the KOETC approach depends on the quality of the Koopman Operator approximation and the choice of lifting functions [19]. The selection of appropriate observables is a non-trivial task, and improper choices can lead to significant modeling errors. To address this, recent research has focused on developing adaptive and data-driven methods to refine the Koopman representation. These methods iteratively update the lifting functions based on the system's operating conditions, thereby improving the accuracy of the linear approximation. Despite these challenges, the KOETC framework holds promise for enhancing the safety and efficiency of emergency vehicle operations by providing a robust and computationally efficient control strategy.

### 5.1.3 Koopman Canonical Transform for Control-Affine Systems
The Koopman Canonical Transform (KCT) represents a significant advancement in the control of nonlinear systems, particularly those that are control-affine [17]. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on local linearizations or complex nonlinear control designs, the KCT leverages the Koopman operator to transform the nonlinear dynamics into a higher-dimensional linear system. This transformation is achieved by lifting the state variables and control inputs into a feature space where the dynamics can be represented as a bilinear system, known as the Koopman Bilinear Form (KBF) [17]. The KBF is particularly advantageous because it allows for the application of well-established linear control techniques, such as optimal control and model predictive control (MPC), to nonlinear systems.

One of the key challenges in applying the KCT to control-affine systems is the selection of appropriate lifting functions, which map the original state and control inputs to the higher-dimensional feature space. Traditional methods often require a priori knowledge of the system dynamics and the selection of a dictionary of basis functions. However, recent developments have introduced dictionary-free representations, which automatically learn the lifting functions from data. This data-driven approach significantly reduces the complexity and computational burden associated with the selection of lifting functions. The dictionary-free Koopman representation is typically constructed using iterative algorithms that refine the lifting functions to better approximate the nonlinear dynamics over the operating region of interest.

The integration of the dictionary-free Koopman representation with predictive control frameworks, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), has led to the development of Dictionary-Free Koopman MPC (DF-KMPC) [19]. DF-KMPC combines the advantages of the Koopman operator's global linearization properties with the flexibility and performance of MPC. By leveraging the linear structure of the lifted system, DF-KMPC can efficiently solve optimization problems in real-time, making it suitable for applications requiring rapid and accurate control, such as robotic systems and autonomous vehicles. The effectiveness of DF-KMPC has been demonstrated in various simulation and experimental studies, highlighting its potential to enhance the control of complex, nonlinear systems.

## 5.2 Machine Learning for Real-Time Estimation and Control

### 5.2.1 Machine Learning for Adaptive Optics Telemetry
Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in the field of Adaptive Optics (AO) telemetry, particularly for wavefront sensing and correction. Traditional AO systems rely on complex and computationally intensive algorithms to process wavefront sensor (WFS) data and correct for atmospheric turbulence. However, the advent of ML techniques, especially deep learning, has enabled the development of more efficient and accurate methods for estimating wavefront aberrations from WFS images. These ML models, often trained on large datasets of simulated or real AO telemetry, can rapidly and accurately predict the wavefront distortion, thereby improving the overall performance of AO systems.

One of the key advantages of ML in AO telemetry is its ability to handle the non-linear and dynamic nature of atmospheric turbulence. Traditional methods, such as those based on Zernike polynomials, often struggle to capture the full complexity of wavefront distortions, especially under highly turbulent conditions. In contrast, ML models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can learn intricate patterns in WFS data and generalize well to unseen conditions. This robustness is crucial for real-time applications, where the atmospheric conditions can change rapidly. Moreover, ML models can be trained to estimate important parameters, such as the Fried parameter, which characterizes the strength of atmospheric turbulence, directly from WFS images. This capability allows for real-time monitoring and adjustment of AO systems, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency.

Another significant application of ML in AO telemetry is the reduction of computational latency. Traditional AO systems often require extensive processing time to compute wavefront corrections, which can limit their effectiveness in high-speed applications. ML models, once trained, can perform these computations much faster, often in real-time. This speed is particularly important for applications such as astronomical observations, where the ability to quickly correct for atmospheric distortions can significantly improve the quality of the collected data. Additionally, ML techniques can be integrated with other data-driven approaches, such as Koopman operator theory, to develop more comprehensive and adaptive control strategies for AO systems. These integrated approaches leverage the strengths of both model-based and data-driven methods, leading to more robust and versatile AO systems.

### 5.2.2 Machine Learning for Power Module Temperature Estimation
Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for estimating the case temperature of power modules in electric drives, offering significant advantages over traditional thermal modeling approaches [20]. By leveraging existing measured signals, ML models can accurately predict temperature variations under both static and dynamic operating conditions without the need for explicit power loss calculations [20]. This capability is particularly valuable in real-time applications where rapid and accurate temperature estimation is essential for system performance and reliability.

The application of ML in power module temperature estimation typically involves the use of supervised learning algorithms, such as neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees. These models are trained on historical data sets that include various operating parameters, such as current, voltage, and ambient temperature, along with corresponding temperature measurements. The training process enables the ML model to learn the complex, nonlinear relationships between these inputs and the temperature output [20]. Once trained, the model can provide real-time temperature predictions, facilitating proactive thermal management and preventing overheating, which is critical for extending the lifespan and efficiency of power modules.

Recent advancements in ML, particularly deep learning techniques, have further enhanced the accuracy and robustness of temperature estimation models. Deep neural networks, with their ability to capture intricate patterns in large data sets, have shown superior performance in handling the nonlinearity and variability inherent in power module thermal dynamics. Moreover, the integration of ML with real-time data streams from sensors and control systems allows for continuous model updating and adaptation, ensuring that the temperature predictions remain accurate even under changing operating conditions. This data-driven approach not only simplifies the modeling process but also reduces the dependency on complex and resource-intensive physical models, making it a practical and scalable solution for modern power electronics systems.

### 5.2.3 Dictionary-Free Koopman Model Predictive Control
Dictionary-Free Koopman Model Predictive Control (DF-KMPC) represents a significant advancement in the control of complex, nonlinear systems, particularly in scenarios where traditional model-based approaches are either impractical or insufficient [19]. Unlike conventional Koopman-based methods that rely on predefined dictionaries to approximate the Koopman operator, DF-KMPC leverages data-driven techniques to construct a linear representation of the system dynamics directly from observed data. This approach is grounded in an extension of Willems' fundamental lemma, which enables the identification of a linear model that captures the essential dynamics of the system without the need for explicit feature selection or lifting transformations. The resulting model is both computationally efficient and flexible, making it well-suited for real-time control applications.

The core of DF-KMPC lies in its ability to iteratively refine the Koopman representation through a process of data collection and model updating. This iterative refinement ensures that the linear model remains accurate and relevant to the current operating conditions of the system. By integrating this data-driven Koopman representation with model predictive control (MPC), DF-KMPC can generate optimal control inputs that account for the nonlinearities and uncertainties inherent in the system [19]. The MPC framework allows for the incorporation of constraints and objectives, such as safety, efficiency, and performance, into the control strategy. This integration is particularly advantageous in mixed traffic scenarios involving connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), where the dynamics are highly nonlinear and the operating environment is dynamic and uncertain [19].

Moreover, DF-KMPC addresses the limitations of traditional Koopman-based methods by avoiding the need for a fixed dictionary, which can be restrictive and may not capture the full range of system behaviors. Instead, the method dynamically adapts to the data, allowing for a more accurate and robust representation of the system. This adaptability is crucial in applications where the system dynamics can change over time, such as in emergency response vehicles or snow-clearing operations, where the operating conditions can vary significantly. By leveraging the strengths of both data-driven and model-based approaches, DF-KMPC provides a powerful tool for designing control strategies that are both effective and adaptable to a wide range of operational scenarios.

## 5.3 Data-Driven Control and Multimodal Data

### 5.3.1 Data-Driven Control for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
Data-driven control for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) has emerged as a critical approach to address the challenges posed by mixed traffic dynamics, where human-driven vehicles and CAVs coexist [19]. Traditional control methods, which rely on first-principles models, often struggle to capture the complex and nonlinear behaviors of mixed traffic. To overcome these limitations, data-driven approaches leverage real-world data to approximate the system dynamics, thereby enabling more robust and adaptive control strategies [9]. One prominent method is the Data-Enabled Predictive Control (DeePC), which utilizes Willems' fundamental lemma to construct a data-driven linear representation of the system [19]. This approach has been successfully applied to Leading Cruise Control (LCC) in mixed traffic, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining safe distances and smooth acceleration profiles.

Recent advancements in data-driven control for CAVs have also explored the use of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and its extensions, such as Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (eDMD). These techniques represent nonlinear systems as control-affine linear systems, providing a powerful tool for real-time control. For instance, eDMD has been used to develop feedback controllers that stabilize nonlinear systems by leveraging a lifted bilinear representation [17]. This method requires sufficiently rich data and an appropriate region of attraction, making it suitable for scenarios where detailed system models are not available. Moreover, the Koopman canonical transform has been applied to lift nonlinear dynamical systems into a higher-dimensional space, where they can be approximated as control-affine, bilinear systems [17]. This approach has shown promise in enhancing the stability and performance of CAVs in dynamic traffic conditions.

Despite the advancements in data-driven control, several challenges remain. One key issue is the need for high-quality, diverse data to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the control algorithms. Additionally, the computational complexity of these methods, particularly in real-time applications, must be addressed to ensure practical implementation. Future research should focus on developing more efficient data-driven algorithms and integrating them with existing control frameworks to enhance the safety and efficiency of CAVs in mixed traffic environments [19]. Furthermore, the integration of data-driven control with other emerging technologies, such as edge computing and IoT, could provide a more comprehensive solution for real-time traffic management and vehicle coordination.

### 5.3.2 Multimodal Dataset for Rehabilitation Robotics
In the realm of rehabilitation robotics, the development of multimodal datasets is crucial for advancing control algorithms and enhancing the understanding of human movement [21]. These datasets typically integrate various data sources, including kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic (EMG) signals, to provide a comprehensive view of human motion during rehabilitation exercises. The inclusion of multiple modalities is essential for capturing the complex interactions between the human body and robotic devices, enabling more accurate and adaptive control strategies. However, the creation of such datasets poses significant challenges, particularly in ensuring the synchronization and alignment of data from different sources, as well as in maintaining the quality and consistency of the data across various experimental conditions.

One of the primary applications of multimodal datasets in rehabilitation robotics is the development of control algorithms for lower limb exoskeletons and prostheses. These datasets often include a wide range of movement patterns and environmental conditions, such as walking on different terrains, navigating obstacles, and performing tasks that involve varying levels of muscle fatigue. By incorporating these diverse scenarios, researchers can better understand the biomechanical and physiological responses of patients during rehabilitation, leading to the design of more intuitive and effective assistive devices. Additionally, the use of multimodal data facilitates the integration of machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and reinforcement learning, which can help in predicting patient intentions and adjusting the robotic assistance in real-time.

Despite the advancements in data collection and processing techniques, there remains a significant gap in the availability of large-scale, high-quality multimodal datasets that capture the full spectrum of human movement and environmental interactions [21]. This gap is particularly pronounced in the context of rehabilitation robotics, where the variability in patient conditions and the complexity of the tasks performed require extensive and diverse data. To address this, recent efforts have focused on developing standardized protocols for data collection and annotation, as well as on leveraging advanced sensor technologies to improve data resolution and reliability. The continued development and sharing of such datasets are essential for driving innovation in rehabilitation robotics and improving the outcomes of therapeutic interventions [21].

### 5.3.3 IR Camera Systems for Driver Assistance
IR camera systems represent a significant advancement in driver assistance technologies, particularly in low-visibility conditions [22]. These systems operate by detecting thermal radiation emitted by objects, which allows them to function effectively in environments where traditional visible-spectrum cameras are limited. The ability of IR cameras to detect heat signatures means they can identify pedestrians, animals, and other vehicles even in complete darkness or under adverse weather conditions such as fog or heavy rain. This capability is crucial for enhancing safety in emergency response scenarios, where quick and accurate detection of obstacles and hazards is paramount.

The integration of IR camera systems into driver assistance platforms involves both hardware and software components. On the hardware side, these systems typically consist of a thermal imaging sensor, a processing unit, and a display interface. The thermal imaging sensor captures the infrared radiation and converts it into an electrical signal, which is then processed to generate a visual image. Advanced algorithms are employed to enhance the image quality, filter out noise, and improve the detection accuracy. Machine learning techniques, such as deep neural networks, are increasingly being used to classify and track detected objects, thereby reducing false positives and improving overall system reliability.

In evaluating the performance of IR camera systems for driver assistance, several key metrics are considered, including detection range, resolution, and response time [22]. Field tests and laboratory experiments have shown that IR cameras can detect objects at distances exceeding 300 meters, which is significantly farther than what is achievable with visible-light cameras. However, the effectiveness of these systems can be influenced by environmental factors such as ambient temperature and humidity. Therefore, ongoing research focuses on optimizing the performance of IR cameras across a wide range of conditions, ensuring they remain a robust and reliable tool for enhancing driver safety in low-visibility environments [22].
