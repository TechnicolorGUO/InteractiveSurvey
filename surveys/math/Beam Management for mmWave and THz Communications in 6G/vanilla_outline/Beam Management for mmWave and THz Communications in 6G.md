## 2.3 Beam Management Fundamentals

Beam management is a critical component of mmWave and THz communication systems, encompassing various processes to establish, maintain, and recover communication links. It involves several key operations:

### Beamforming

Beamforming is the process of shaping and directing the signal energy towards the intended receiver. In mmWave and THz systems, beamforming is essential due to the high path loss and narrow beamwidths. The three main types of beamforming are:

- **Analog Beamforming**: Utilizes phase shifters to steer the beam direction. The beam pattern is formed by adjusting the phase of each antenna element. Mathematically, the steering vector $\mathbf{a}(\theta)$ for an array with $N$ elements can be expressed as:
$$ \mathbf{a}(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} [1, e^{j\frac{2\pi d}{\lambda}\sin(\theta)}, \dots, e^{j(N-1)\frac{2\pi d}{\lambda}\sin(\theta)}]^T $$
where $d$ is the inter-element spacing, $\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $\theta$ is the angle of arrival.

- **Hybrid Beamforming**: Combines analog and digital beamforming to balance performance and complexity. It uses a reduced number of RF chains while maintaining flexibility.

- **Digital Beamforming**: Performs beamforming in the digital domain, offering full control over the beam pattern but requiring more hardware resources.

### Beam Alignment and Tracking

Beam alignment involves finding the optimal beam pair between the transmitter and receiver. Initial beam alignment establishes the initial connection, while beam refinement improves the beam quality. Beam tracking maintains the connection by adapting to changes in the environment.

### Beam Recovery and Handover

Beam recovery mechanisms detect and recover from beam failures, ensuring continuous communication. Beam handover procedures manage the transition between different beams or cells, minimizing service disruptions.

# 3 Related Work

Beam management is a critical aspect of mmWave and THz communications, especially as these technologies evolve towards 6G. This section reviews the existing literature on beam management techniques, highlighting early approaches, current research trends, and the challenges that remain.

## 3.1 Early Beam Management Techniques

The initial focus in beam management was primarily on addressing the high path loss and narrow beamwidth characteristics inherent to mmWave and THz frequencies. Early techniques often relied on simple algorithms for beam alignment and tracking, leveraging predefined beam patterns or exhaustive searches. For instance, analog beamforming was widely used due to its simplicity and low hardware complexity. However, these methods were limited by their inability to adapt dynamically to changing channel conditions. The performance of early systems was also constrained by the lack of sophisticated feedback mechanisms, leading to suboptimal beam selection and frequent misalignments.

### Key Contributions

- **Beam Alignment:** Early works focused on static beam alignment using fixed beam patterns, which were effective in controlled environments but less so in dynamic scenarios.
- **Beam Tracking:** Initial tracking methods were based on periodic beam sweeping, which introduced significant overhead and latency.

Hybrid beamforming, combining the benefits of analog and digital beamforming, has emerged as a popular approach. Additionally, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly being integrated into beam management systems to enhance decision-making processes.

### Machine Learning in Beam Management

Machine learning models, particularly deep learning architectures, are being explored for predicting channel conditions and optimizing beam selection. These models can learn from historical data and adapt to new environments, thereby improving the efficiency and robustness of beam management. For example, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can be used to dynamically adjust beam parameters based on real-time feedback, minimizing the likelihood of beam failures.

$$
\text{Loss Function} = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y) \sim D}[L(f(x), y)]
$$

Another challenge is the computational complexity associated with advanced beamforming algorithms, which can be resource-intensive and may not be feasible for real-time applications.

### Environmental Sensitivity

mmWave and THz signals are highly susceptible to blockages caused by obstacles like buildings, vehicles, and even human bodies. This sensitivity necessitates the development of robust beam recovery mechanisms and efficient handover procedures to ensure continuous connectivity.

### Computational Complexity

Advanced beamforming techniques, particularly those involving ML and AI, require substantial computational resources. Reducing this complexity while maintaining performance is a key area of ongoing research. Additionally, the energy consumption of these systems must be minimized to support the deployment of large-scale 6G networks.

In summary, while early beam management techniques laid the foundation for modern systems, current research is focused on overcoming the limitations of these approaches through innovative solutions. Addressing the remaining challenges will be essential for realizing the full potential of mmWave and THz communications in 6G.
