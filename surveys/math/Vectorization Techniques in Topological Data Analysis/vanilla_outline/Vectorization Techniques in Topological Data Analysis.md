# 1 Introduction
Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as a powerful framework for extracting meaningful insights from complex and high-dimensional datasets. By leveraging tools from algebraic topology, TDA provides robust methods to capture the shape and structure of data at various scales. However, integrating TDA with machine learning workflows often requires converting topological features into vectorized representations that can be processed by algorithms such as neural networks or support vector machines. This survey explores the state-of-the-art techniques for vectorizing topological data and their applications across diverse domains.

## 1.1 Motivation
The increasing complexity of modern datasets poses significant challenges for traditional machine learning approaches. While these methods excel at handling tabular or structured data, they struggle to effectively model relationships in unstructured or high-dimensional settings. TDA addresses this limitation by representing data through topological summaries, such as persistence diagrams or barcodes, which encode the connectivity and shape of data points. However, these summaries are not directly compatible with most machine learning models due to their non-vectorial nature. Thus, there is a critical need for effective vectorization techniques that bridge the gap between TDA and machine learning. This survey aims to address this need by providing a comprehensive overview of existing vectorization methods and their practical implications.

## 1.2 Objectives

By achieving these objectives, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a clear understanding of the landscape of vectorization techniques in TDA and inspire further advancements in this rapidly evolving field.

# 2 Background

To fully appreciate the vectorization techniques in topological data analysis (TDA), it is essential to first establish a foundational understanding of TDA and its relationship with machine learning. This section provides an overview of TDA, introduces key concepts such as persistent homology and simplicial complexes, and discusses the role of vectorization in integrating TDA with machine learning.

## 2.1 Topological Data Analysis Overview

Topological data analysis (TDA) is a rapidly growing field that leverages tools from algebraic topology to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. Unlike traditional statistical methods, TDA focuses on capturing the shape and structure of data at various scales. By representing data as topological spaces, TDA enables the identification of robust features that are invariant under continuous transformations.

### 2.1.1 Persistent Homology

Persistent homology is one of the cornerstone techniques in TDA. It quantifies the evolution of topological features across different scales by constructing a filtration of a dataset. A filtration is a nested sequence of topological spaces $K_1 \subseteq K_2 \subseteq \dots \subseteq K_n$, where each space corresponds to a specific scale. The persistence diagram, a key output of persistent homology, encodes the birth and death of topological features (e.g., connected components, loops, voids) during the filtration process. Mathematically, for a given filtration, the $k$-th persistent homology group is defined as:

$$
H_k(K_i) = \ker(\partial_k) / \text{im}(\partial_{k+1}),
$$
where $\partial_k$ represents the boundary operator for $k$-dimensional simplices.

### 2.1.2 Simplicial Complexes

Simplicial complexes serve as the primary mathematical structures used in TDA to represent datasets. A simplicial complex is a collection of simplices (points, edges, triangles, tetrahedra, etc.) that satisfies certain inclusion properties. For example, if a triangle is included in the complex, all of its edges and vertices must also be included. Common constructions of simplicial complexes include Vietoris-Rips complexes and Čech complexes, which approximate the topology of point cloud data based on pairwise distances.

| Type of Complex | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Vietoris-Rips    | Connects points within a fixed radius to form higher-dimensional simplices. |
| Čech             | Requires complete coverage of intersections between balls centered at points. |

### 2.1.3 Topological Features

The topological features extracted through persistent homology provide a rich summary of the dataset's structure. These features include connected components ($H_0$), loops or cycles ($H_1$), and voids or cavities ($H_2$). Each feature corresponds to a specific dimension of the homology groups, offering insights into the connectivity and organization of the data.

## 2.2 Machine Learning and Vectorization

While TDA excels at extracting topological features, these features often exist in non-vectorized formats (e.g., persistence diagrams, barcodes) that are incompatible with standard machine learning algorithms. To bridge this gap, vectorization techniques transform topological signatures into numerical representations suitable for input into machine learning models.

### 2.2.1 Importance of Vectorization

Vectorization plays a critical role in enabling the integration of TDA with machine learning. By converting topological features into fixed-length vectors, matrices, or other structured formats, vectorization facilitates compatibility with algorithms such as support vector machines, neural networks, and ensemble methods. Moreover, vectorized representations allow for efficient computation and scalability, making TDA applicable to large-scale datasets.

### 2.2.2 Challenges in Vectorizing Topological Data

Despite its importance, vectorization of topological data presents several challenges. First, the inherent variability in the size and structure of persistence diagrams complicates their transformation into uniform representations. Second, preserving the geometric and topological information during vectorization is crucial to maintaining the interpretability of results. Finally, computational efficiency remains a concern, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional or noisy data. Addressing these challenges requires innovative approaches, as discussed in subsequent sections.

# 3 Vectorization Techniques in TDA

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) provides a powerful framework for extracting meaningful topological features from complex datasets. However, to integrate these features into machine learning pipelines, it is necessary to convert them into vectorized representations that can be processed by algorithms such as classifiers or regressors. This section explores various techniques for vectorizing topological data, focusing on persistence diagrams, feature engineering approaches, and deep learning-based methods.

## 3.1 Persistence Diagrams

Persistence diagrams are one of the most widely used representations in TDA, capturing the birth and death of topological features across different scales. These diagrams consist of points $(b, d)$, where $b$ represents the birth time and $d$ the death time of a feature. Since persistence diagrams are not inherently vectorized, several methods have been developed to convert them into usable formats for machine learning.

### 3.1.1 Vectorization via Kernel Methods

Kernel methods provide a way to compute similarities between persistence diagrams without explicitly converting them into vectors. A popular approach involves defining a kernel function $k(D_1, D_2)$ that measures similarity between two diagrams $D_1$ and $D_2$. For instance, the **Sliced Wasserstein Kernel** computes the similarity based on the Wasserstein distance along random projections of the diagrams:

$$
K_{SW}(D_1, D_2) = \int_{\theta} W_p(\pi_\theta(D_1), \pi_\theta(D_2))^p d\theta,
$$
where $\pi_\theta$ denotes projection onto a direction $\theta$, and $W_p$ is the Wasserstein distance of order $p$. Another notable kernel is the **Persistence Fisher Kernel**, which models persistence diagrams using probability distributions and computes their similarity through the Fisher information metric.

![](placeholder_for_kernel_methods_diagram)

### 3.1.2 Persistence Images

Persistence images offer a grid-based representation of persistence diagrams, enabling direct vectorization. Each point $(b, d)$ in the diagram is mapped to a pixel in a 2D grid, with its contribution weighted by a Gaussian kernel centered at $(b, d)$. The resulting image can then be flattened into a vector for use in machine learning models. This method balances interpretability and computational efficiency while preserving the structure of the original diagram.

| Feature | Sliced Wasserstein Kernel | Persistence Images |
|---------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Computational Complexity | High | Moderate |
| Interpretability | Low | High |

### 3.1.3 Persistence Landscapes

Persistence landscapes represent persistence diagrams as a sequence of piecewise-linear functions, providing a functional representation that can be easily vectorized. Given a diagram $D$, the $k$-th landscape function $\lambda_k(t)$ is defined as the $k$-th largest value of $\max(0, d-b)$ over all points $(b, d) \in D$ such that $b \leq t \leq d$. These functions can then be integrated or sampled to produce numerical vectors suitable for machine learning tasks.

$$
\lambda_k(t) = \text{k-th largest } \{ \max(0, d-b) : (b,d) \in D, b \leq t \leq d \}.
$$

## 3.2 Feature Engineering Approaches

Feature engineering approaches focus on deriving scalar or vector-valued summaries directly from topological data. These methods often emphasize simplicity and interpretability, making them suitable for traditional machine learning algorithms.

### 3.2.1 Betti Curves

Betti curves summarize the evolution of Betti numbers across filtration scales. For a given filtration parameter $t$, the Betti curve $\beta_k(t)$ represents the number of $k$-dimensional topological features present at scale $t$. By stacking Betti curves for different dimensions, one obtains a multi-dimensional time series that can serve as input to classification or regression models.

$$
\beta_k(t) = \# \{ \text{features of dimension } k \text{ at scale } t \}.
$$

### 3.2.2 Euler Characteristic Curves

Euler characteristic curves generalize Betti curves by combining information from all dimensions into a single scalar measure. The Euler characteristic $\chi(t)$ at scale $t$ is defined as the alternating sum of Betti numbers:

$$
\chi(t) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \beta_k(t).
$$

This compact representation captures the overall topology of the dataset at each scale and can be particularly useful for detecting global patterns.

### 3.2.3 Barcode Summaries

Barcodes, which are equivalent to persistence diagrams but represented as collections of intervals, can also be summarized numerically. Common summaries include the total length of all intervals, the longest interval, or statistical moments such as mean and variance of interval lengths. These summaries provide concise yet informative descriptions of the underlying topology.

## 3.3 Deep Learning-Based Methods

Deep learning has revolutionized many areas of data science, and recent advances have extended its applicability to topological data. Below, we discuss several deep learning-based approaches tailored for TDA.

### 3.3.1 Neural Networks for Persistence Diagrams

Neural networks designed specifically for persistence diagrams enable end-to-end learning of topological features. One prominent architecture is the **DeepSet** model, which operates on sets of points and is invariant to permutations. By applying a learnable transformation to each point in the diagram and aggregating the results, the model produces a fixed-size vector encoding the diagram's information.

$$
\phi(D) = \rho\left( \sum_{(b,d) \in D} \psi(b,d) \right),
$$
where $\psi$ and $\rho$ are neural network layers.

### 3.3.2 Graph Neural Networks for Simplicial Complexes

Graph neural networks (GNNs) extend naturally to simplicial complexes, allowing for the processing of higher-order interactions beyond pairwise relationships. By representing simplices as nodes and their inclusion relations as edges, GNNs can propagate information across the complex and learn hierarchical topological features.

### 3.3.3 Autoencoders for Topological Signatures

Autoencoders provide a flexible framework for compressing and reconstructing topological signatures such as persistence diagrams or barcodes. By training an encoder-decoder architecture to minimize reconstruction error, autoencoders learn latent representations that capture essential topological information while discarding noise or redundancy. These latent vectors can then be used as inputs for downstream tasks.

# 4 Applications of Vectorized TDA

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has found a wide range of applications across various domains due to its ability to extract meaningful topological features from complex datasets. When combined with vectorization techniques, these features can be seamlessly integrated into machine learning pipelines, enabling the analysis of data in ways that were previously unattainable. This section explores key application areas where vectorized TDA has demonstrated significant impact.

## 4.1 In Material Science

Material science is one of the most promising fields for the application of TDA, particularly in analyzing structural and functional properties of materials. The inherent complexity of material structures makes them ideal candidates for topological analysis, as their properties often depend on intricate spatial arrangements.

### 4.1.1 Crystal Structure Analysis

Crystallography involves studying the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids. Vectorized TDA provides tools to analyze and classify crystal structures by capturing their topological signatures. For instance, persistent homology can detect voids, loops, and other higher-dimensional features within crystal lattices. These features are then vectorized using methods such as persistence diagrams or Betti curves, allowing for efficient comparison and clustering of different crystal types.

$$	ext{Betti}_k = \dim H_k(X),$$
where $H_k(X)$ represents the $k$-th homology group of the space $X$, quantifying the number of $k$-dimensional holes.

![](placeholder_for_crystal_structure_analysis)

### 4.1.2 Porous Material Classification

Porous materials, such as zeolites and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), exhibit complex pore structures that influence their functionality. Vectorized TDA enables the characterization of these pore networks by identifying and summarizing their topological features. Techniques like persistence landscapes or Euler characteristic curves have been successfully applied to classify porous materials based on their connectivity and porosity.

| Feature Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Persistence Diagram | Captures birth-death pairs of topological features. |
| Euler Curve | Tracks changes in Euler characteristic over filtration scales. |

## 4.2 In Biology and Medicine

The application of vectorized TDA in biology and medicine has opened new avenues for understanding complex biological systems and medical data.

### 4.2.1 Protein Structure Prediction

Proteins are essential biomolecules whose functions are closely tied to their three-dimensional structures. TDA offers a unique perspective by representing protein structures as simplicial complexes and analyzing their topological properties. Vectorization techniques, such as persistence images or neural networks tailored for persistence diagrams, enable the prediction of protein folding patterns and interactions with high accuracy.

$$d_{\text{PI}}(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i,j} (x_{ij} - y_{ij})^2},$$
where $d_{\text{PI}}$ denotes the distance between two persistence images.

### 4.2.2 Brain Network Analysis

Brain networks, represented as graphs, exhibit rich topological structures that reflect cognitive processes and neurological disorders. By applying vectorized TDA, researchers can uncover hidden patterns in brain connectivity data. For example, barcode summaries or graph neural networks can be used to analyze differences in brain networks between healthy individuals and those with neurodegenerative diseases.

![](placeholder_for_brain_network_analysis)

## 4.3 In Image and Signal Processing

In image and signal processing, vectorized TDA has proven valuable for tasks requiring robust feature extraction and classification.

### 4.3.1 Texture Classification

Texture analysis is crucial in computer vision applications. TDA-based methods capture the multiscale topology of textures, which are then vectorized for classification purposes. Techniques such as Betti curves or persistence landscapes provide discriminative representations that outperform traditional texture descriptors in many cases.

### 4.3.2 Time-Series Analysis

Time-series data often exhibit non-linear dynamics that are challenging to model using conventional methods. Vectorized TDA offers an alternative approach by converting time-series into point clouds and analyzing their topological features. For instance, sliding window embeddings combined with persistence diagrams allow for the detection of recurrent patterns and anomalies in time-series data.

$$\text{Sliding Window Embedding: } x(t) \mapsto [x(t), x(t+1), \dots, x(t+w)],$$
where $w$ is the window size.
