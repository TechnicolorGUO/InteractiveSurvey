# 1. Introduction  

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a relatively new field focused on analyzing the shape and structure inherent in data [20]. Unlike traditional data analysis methods that often rely on geometric or statistical properties, TDA distinguishes itself by employing topological tools to understand data from a different perspective, particularly focusing on persistent features across varying scales [20]. This approach is gaining increasing importance due to its ability to capture key structural characteristics of complex, high-dimensional data that might be missed by conventional techniques [11,14,15,18,19,20]. TDA has demonstrated potential to enhance the robustness of machine learning models, for instance, by incorporating topological insights to focus the model's search space on relevant features [6].​  

A cornerstone method within TDA is Persistent Homology (PH), which provides a robust framework for quantifying multiscale topological information [18,20]. PH enables the identification and tracking of topological features, such as connected components (0-dimensional homology), loops (1-dimensional homology), and voids (higher-dimensional homology), as a scale parameter varies. The output of PH is typically represented as a persistence diagram or barcode, which depicts the "birth" and "death" parameters of topological features across scales [20]. This representation effectively embeds multiscale geometric information into topological invariants, connecting geometric and topological analyses [13].  

While persistence diagrams and barcodes offer a rich representation of data topology, they are not directly compatible with standard machine learning algorithms, which typically require fixed-length vector inputs [1,13,18,20].

This incompatibility necessitates the development of vectorization techniques to transform the output of PH into a suitable vector format [11,13,14,15,18,19,20]. The goal is to create feature vectors that effectively capture the topological information contained in the persistence diagrams while being amenable to input into standard machine learning pipelines for tasks such as classification, regression, or clustering.  

The development of effective vectorization techniques faces several significant challenges. Foremost among these is the challenge of preserving the crucial topological information from the persistence diagrams during the transformation into a fixed-length vector. Different vectorization methods may emphasize different aspects of the topological signature, potentially losing subtle but important features. Computational complexity is another challenge, particularly when dealing with large datasets or complex topological structures. Furthermore, the sensitivity of vectorization methods to parameters used in the PH computation or the vectorization process itself can impact the robustness and interpretability of the resulting features.​  

The integration of TDA, specifically persistent homology and subsequent vectorization, has found applications across diverse fields. In materials science, PH has been used to characterize microstructures, such as cementite in pearlite steel, enabling data-driven microstructure optimization and property prediction [2,13]. For complex molecular dynamics data, such as protein folding simulations, TDA techniques including PH and non-negative matrix factorization have been employed to reduce dimensionality and reveal distinct folding paths [8]. TDA has also been applied in image analysis, notably in image segmentation, where topology-based loss functions incorporating persistent homology can address the limitations of pixel-level losses in capturing global topological structures [12,14]. Moreover, TDA can be used to analyze the intrinsic properties of neural networks for tasks like estimating generalization error without validation sets [16] or transforming complex prediction models for simplified inspection [9]. The necessity of dimensionality reduction techniques, often a precursor or related step in high-dimensional data analysis [4], further underscores the importance of methods like TDA and its vectorization outputs, sometimes contrasted with or complemented by methods like UMAP or t-SNE [9,17].  

This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of vectorization techniques in Topological Data Analysis. The subsequent sections will delve into the necessary background on TDA and persistent homology, explore various methods developed for vectorizing persistence diagrams, discuss their applications in different domains, and highlight promising directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.  

# 2. Background on Topological Data Analysis (TDA)  

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) constitutes a suite of computational methods rooted in algebraic topology, dedicated to extracting, analyzing, and understanding the shape and structure inherent in complex datasets [20,25,26]. Unlike traditional statistical or geometric approaches that may focus on local properties or assume specific data distributions, TDA emphasizes global topological features such as connectivity, loops, voids, and higher-dimensional structures [13,20]. This focus on topological invariants renders TDA robust to noise and sampling variability, and its results are invariant under continuous deformations of the data, offering a unique lens for data exploration [20].  

The mathematical foundation of TDA lies in representing data, often initially presented as a point cloud in a metric space, using combinatorial structures called simplicial complexes [1,19]. A simplicial complex is constructed from points (0- simplices), line segments (1-simplices), triangles (2-simplices), and their higher-dimensional counterparts, called simplices. A key property is that if a simplex is included in the complex, all of its faces (simplices formed by subsets of its vertices) must also be included [19]. Common methods for constructing simplicial complexes from point clouds include the Vietoris-Rips complex and the Čech complex. The Vietoris-Rips complex, for a given distance parameter $r$ , includes a simplex for every subset of points where the distance between any two points is less than or equal to $r$ [19,27].  

A central tool within TDA is Persistent Homology (PH) [15,18,20]. PH quantifies the topological features of a dataset across different scales. The process involves constructing a filtration, which is a nested sequence of simplicial complexes derived from the data by progressively increasing a scale parameter [1,11,15,18,20]. For instance, in a Vietoris-Rips filtration, the scale parameter is the maximum allowed distance between points in a simplex; increasing this parameter adds more edges and higher-dimensional simplices [19].​  

As the filtration parameter increases, topological features are "born" when they first appear in a complex and "die" when they are filled in by higher-dimensional simplices in a subsequent complex [1,2,8,13,14]. Persistent homology tracks these features by computing homology groups at each step of the filtration [15]. Homology groups, characterized by Betti numbers $( \beta _ { k } )$ , provide an algebraic description of the $k$ -dimensional "holes" in a space. Specifically, $\beta _ { 0 }$ ​ counts the number of connected components, $\beta _ { 1 }$ ​ counts the number of loops or cycles, and $\beta _ { 2 }$ ​ counts the number of voids or enclosed spaces [12,13,16,19]. The persistence of a feature is its lifespan across the filtration, defined as the difference between the scale at which it is born and the scale at which it dies [2,8].  

The results of persistent homology computations are typically represented as persistence diagrams or barcodes [1,2,12,13,14,15,18,20,24]. A persistence diagram plots each topological feature as a point $( b , d )$ , where $b$ is the birth scale and $d$ is the death scale. Features with long lifetimes $( d - b )$ are considered structurally significant and lie far from the diagonal line $y = x$ , while short-lived features near the diagonal are often considered noise [2,18,19]. A barcode is an equivalent visualization where each feature is represented by a horizontal interval from its birth to death scale, with longer bars indicating greater persistence [1,12,13,14,18,24].​  

TDA offers several notable advantages for data analysis. It excels at analyzing high-dimensional data by focusing on topological structure rather than requiring aggressive dimensionality reduction, thereby preserving potentially important intrinsic details [9,20]. Its inherent robustness to noise and invariance to coordinate transformations provide stable and reliable analyses [6,20]. Furthermore, TDA provides a high level of abstraction, capturing nonlocal characteristics like "unfolded states" or specific structural components (independent entities, loops, cavities) that might be missed by local methods [8,13]. It can offer quantitative definitions of microstructures and insights into complex systems, including the internal dynamics of machine learning models [2,6,16]. TDA can also enforce desired topological properties in applications like image segmentation [12].​

Despite its strengths, TDA, particularly PH, faces significant limitations. The computational cost of persistent homology can be substantial, especially for large datasets or high-resolution data, partly due to the lack of excision property in standard constructions like the Vietoris-Rips complex, hindering local-to-global approaches [12,16,27]. The choice of parameters for filtration construction can also significantly influence the results, posing a challenge for consistent analysis [14]. Interpreting the resulting topological features and mapping them back to domain-specific insights can be difficult, as PH provides global structural information and may struggle to differentiate geometrically distinct but topologically similar structures [1,8,13,14]. Applications to complex models, such as deep neural networks, are still an active area of research with ongoing challenges [9,16]. Computational challenges are being addressed through algorithms leveraging techniques like discrete Morse theory, implemented in software like Perseus, which improve efficiency but still face memory constraints and specific input requirements [10,11]. Approximation methods and parallel computing are also explored to enhance scalability.

Persistent Homology (PH) is a fundamental tool in Topological Data Analysis (TDA) designed to extract and analyze the topological structure of data across multiple spatial scales [15,18,20]. The core idea involves studying how topological features, such as connected components, loops, and voids, emerge and persist as a dataset is examined at varying levels of granularity [18,20]. This approach provides insights into the intrinsic "shape" of the data, independent of specific coordinate locations [20].  

The pipeline for computing persistent homology typically begins with representing the data, often a point cloud, as a sequence of nested simplicial complexes called a filtration [1,11,15,18]. Simplices are basic geometric building blocks: a 0- simplex is a point, a 1-simplex is a line segment, a 2-simplex is a triangle, and so on [18]. The face of a simplex is a simplex formed by a subset of its vertices; for instance, the faces of a triangle are its vertices and edges [19]. A filtration is constructed by progressively including higher-dimensional simplices or connecting existing ones as a scale parameter increases [18,20].  

Common filtration constructions for point cloud data include the Vietoris-Rips complex and the alpha complex. For a dataset $A$ , the Vietoris-Rips complex at a scale parameter $t$ includes all simplices whose vertices are points in $A$ and where the distance between any two vertices does not exceed $t$ [19]. As $t$ increases, more edges and higher-dimensional simplices are added, resulting in a nested sequence of complexes [19]. The alpha complex filtration involves placing balls of increasing radius $r$ around data points and considering the intersection of these balls [8].  

As the filtration parameter increases and simplices are added, topological features are "born" and may subsequently "die" [1,2,8,13,14]. The PH computation tracks these features by calculating homology groups at each step of the filtration [15]. Homology groups capture the number and type of $k$ -dimensional "holes" in the complex. Specifically, 0-dimensional homology ( $H _ { 0 }$ ​ ) tracks connected components, 1-dimensional homology $( H _ { 1 }$ ​ ) tracks loops, and 2-dimensional homology ( $H _ { 2 }$ ​ ) tracks voids or enclosed spaces [16,19]. The scales at which a feature appears (birth) and disappears (death) are recorded [2,8].​  

The results of persistent homology are typically visualized using persistence diagrams or barcodes [1,14,15,18,20]. A persistence diagram is a scatter plot where each point $( b , d )$ represents a topological feature born at scale $b$ and died at scale $d$ [2,18]. The persistence of a feature is represented by the length of its lifetime, $d - b$ . Points far from the diagonal $y = x$ correspond to features with long lifetimes, indicating structural significance, while points close to the diagonal represent short-lived features often attributed to noise or less prominent structures [18,19]. Alternatively, a barcode represents the same information as a set of horizontal intervals, where each interval [1,12,13]. The length of the bar indicates the persistence [14,18]. These representations effectively summarize the stability of topological features across different scales, providing a robust signature of the data's shape [14,15]. Tools like Perseus can compute these persistence intervals efficiently, sometimes employing techniques like discrete Morse theory for complex simplification, and outputting results for visualization [10,11]. Perseus can handle various complex types, including Vietoris-Rips, and commonly computes homology with mod-2 coefficients [10,11]. The similarity between the shapes of two datasets can be assessed by measuring the similarity of their persistence diagrams using metrics like the bottleneck or Wasserstein distance [19]. PH has been applied to diverse data types beyond point clouds, such as analyzing the topological structure of neural networks during training by treating them as weighted directed graphs and computing homology up to various dimensions ( $H _ { 0 }$ ​ to $H _ { 3 }$ ​ ) [16].​  

# 2.2 Advantages and Limitations of TDA  

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) offers a distinctive approach to analyzing complex data, focusing on its underlying shape and structure rather than merely local properties. A primary advantage of TDA, particularly when employing persistent homology, is its capacity to analyze the geometric and topological structure of high-dimensional data without necessitating aggressive dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [9,20]. This enables TDA to preserve more of the original data's intrinsic details [20] and extract representation-invariant information by simplifying the data's shape in its ambient space [9]. Furthermore, TDA exhibits inherent robustness to small perturbations and noise in the data [20], and its results are invariant to rigid transformations, contributing to more stable analyses [20]. This robustness is particularly beneficial in machine learning applications, where TDA can improve model resilience to variations like image rotation [6].  

Beyond these core strengths, TDA facilitates a high level of abstraction, effectively processing high-dimensional structural data by concentrating on connectivity and characterizing structural components such as independent entities, loops, and higher-dimensional topological features [13]. It can capture nonlocal characteristics and reveal aspects like "unfolded states" [8]. The topological features, like loops or cavities, can sometimes be intuitively recognized, providing comprehensible information about the data structure [8]. In specific domains, TDA can offer quantitative definitions of microstructures, surpassing the limitations of traditional experimental methods reliant on expert knowledge and prone to individual variations [2]. TDA has also shown promise in providing insights into the internal processes of machine learning models [6] and enabling validation-free monitoring of neural network training by analyzing internal structure [16]. Additionally, TDA can be used to enforce specific topological structures in tasks like image segmentation, which is valuable when anatomical structures have known topological properties [12].​  

Despite these advantages, TDA, especially methods based on persistent homology, faces several significant limitations. A prominent challenge is the high computational cost associated with persistent homology calculation, particularly for large datasets or high-resolution data like 3D images [12,16]. Standard TDA constructions, such as the Vietoris-Rips complex, do not scale effectively to very large datasets partly because the construction does not satisfy excision, which precludes the use of local-to-global patching arguments common in algebraic topology [27]. Another limitation is the potential sensitivity of results to the choice of parameters used in the filtration construction process [14].  

Furthermore, interpreting the topological features captured by persistence diagrams and relating them back to intuitive, domain-specific characteristics remains a significant hurdle [14]. While features like loops can be intuitive [8], persistent homology typically provides only global topological structure information [13], which may be insufficient for analyzing complex systems composed of many different elements and structures, such as certain inorganic compounds [13]. Standard persistent homology can struggle to distinguish between structures that are topologically similar but geometrically distinct [8]. For instance, pure topological classification might fail to differentiate between individual handwritten digits due to their similar underlying topology [1].​  

The application of TDA to complex predictive models, such as deep learning architectures, is still in its nascent stages [9]. Current TDA-based methods for tasks like neural network analysis may have specific limitations, such as being restricted to certain network types like MLPs and focusing solely on computing correlations rather than building predictive models [16].  

Ongoing research and specialized software are addressing some of these limitations. Algorithms based on discrete Morse theory, like Perseus, offer improved efficiency by avoiding reliance on specific complex structures or dimensions [10,11]. However, even these tools may have specific input requirements and limitations, such as restrictions on birth times and potential needs for dedicated front-ends for various complex types [10]. Memory capacity remains a constraint on the feasible dimension size for these calculations [10]. The limitation of pure topological analysis can be partially mitigated by persistent homology, which incorporates spatial information through the filtration process to provide richer features [1]. Continued development of faster algorithms and more intuitive visualization techniques are active areas aimed at making TDA more scalable and interpretable for increasingly complex and large datasets.  

# 3. Vectorization Techniques for TDA  

Topological Data Analysis (TDA) provides powerful tools for capturing the fundamental shape and structure of data, often yielding representations such as persistence diagrams or barcodes. While rich in topological information, these representations typically reside in metric spaces, with distances like the bottleneck or Wasserstein distance used for comparison [19]. This presents a fundamental challenge for integration into standard machine learning workflows, which predominantly operate on data represented as fixed-length numerical vectors in Euclidean spaces. The process of vectorization in TDA addresses this incompatibility by transforming these complex topological summaries into numerical feature vectors suitable for input into conventional machine learning algorithms.​  

This section introduces various techniques developed to bridge the gap between topological representations and vector space-based learning algorithms. Each method confronts the core challenge of mapping data from a metric space—such as the space of persistence diagrams—to a vector space while striving to preserve relevant topological information [19]. The subsequent discussion will delve into prominent vectorization techniques, detailing their mathematical formulations, outlining their computational characteristics, identifying their advantages and limitations, and providing examples of their application areas.

We will explore methods including Persistence Landscapes, Persistence Images, Heat Kernel Signatures, and Silhouette Functions; vectorization approaches based on decomposing functions like the Persistence Rank Function using bases such as the Haar basis [24]; techniques derived from the graph structure produced by the Mapper algorithm; and explorations into leveraging modern architectures like the Transformer for handling topological data [14,15]. Furthermore, other specific techniques for extracting numerical features or functional signatures from topological data will be discussed. The presentation is organized by technique, highlighting how each method approaches the problem of transforming topological information into an analyzable vector format.  

# 3.1 Persistence Landscapes  

Persistence landscapes represent a stable vectorization approach that transforms a persistence diagram, consisting of a multiset of birth–death pairs $( b , d )$ , into a collection of real-valued functions [12]. This method is particularly well suited for subsequent statistical analysis or integration into machine learning pipelines.  

Mathematically, the construction of persistence landscape functions $\lambda _ { k } ( x )$ for $k = 1 , 2 , \ldots$ from a persistence diagram can be understood by mapping each birth–death pair $( b , d )$ to a piecewise linear function, often called a “tent function”. This tent function, denoted by $f _ { ( b , d ) } ( x )$ , has its peak at  

$$
x = { \frac { b + d } { 2 } }
$$  

with height

Loss = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \bigl(PI_{initial,i} - PI_{target,i}\bigr)^2  

where $n$ is the dimension of the PI vector [2]. Evaluating whether the vectorized representation effectively captures topological patterns is key, as demonstrated by experiments showing the efficacy of low-dimensional vectors derived from supervised manifold learning for this purpose [24].  

The computational cost is another significant factor in evaluating vectorization techniques, encompassing both the time required to generate the initial topological summary (e.g., persistence diagram) and the time and memory needed for the vectorization step itself. While the provided digests primarily focus on performance metrics rather than detailed  

computational cost analysis, this aspect is crucial for the scalability and practical feasibility of different methods, especially when dealing with large datasets.  

Finally, the importance of standardized benchmark datasets cannot be overstated. Objective comparison of different vectorization techniques requires evaluation on common datasets with established ground truth or properties. While specific benchmark datasets are mentioned in the context of evaluating downstream tasks (e.g., MNIST, UK Biobank, ACDC challenge dataset [12]), the development and wider adoption of dedicated benchmark datasets specifically designed to test the topological information retention and discriminative power of vectorized TDA features remains an ongoing area implicitly highlighted by the diverse evaluation strategies employed across studies.  

# 7. Software and Tools for TDA and Vectorization  

Computational topological data analysis relies on specialized software libraries and tools to perform tasks such as constructing complexes, computing persistent homology, and vectorizing topological features.

Several prominent libraries exist for the core computation of persistent homology, including GUDHI, Ripser, and Dionysus [14]. For instance, Dionysus has been utilized in studies for computing persistent homology, requiring dependencies such as Python, Boost, matplotlib, networkx, numpy, sklearn, and skimage [1].  

Perseus is a notable software tool specifically designed for the rapid computation of persistent homology [10]. It supports various types of filtered cell complexes, including cubical, simplicial, and Vietoris-Rips complexes [10,11]. Perseus achieves efficiency by leveraging discrete Morse theory [11]. The software operates by requiring input filtrations to be prepared as correctly formatted text files and subsequently outputs persistent homology intervals, also as text files [11]. Perseus is  

accessible as precompiled executables for major operating systems including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS, and its source code is also available for compilation [10].  

Beyond these core libraries, other tools are employed for specific TDA computations. HomCloud, for example, has been used for calculating births, deaths, and volume optimal cycles [8]. On different computational platforms, toolboxes like Javaplex are available within environments such as MATLAB for computing persistent homology [20].​  

For vectorization techniques, higher-level libraries often provide interfaces to convert persistent homology diagrams into numerical vectors suitable for machine learning tasks [14]. While specific vectorization toolboxes like the Persistence Landscape Toolbox or Persistence Image Toolbox exist, integrated libraries such as scikit-tda aim to streamline this process [14]. Downstream analysis following vectorization frequently utilizes general machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn [8].​

# 8. Challenges and Future Directions  

The effective vectorization of topological data for machine learning presents a multifaceted set of challenges that currently constrain the widespread application and full potential of Topological Data Analysis (TDA).

A primary concern revolves around the computational cost and scalability of TDA constructions, particularly for large and complex datasets [14]. The calculation of persistent homology, a fundamental step in many TDA pipelines, can be computationally intensive—especially for high-dimensional data, large images, or 3D volumes [12]. For instance, analyzing even relatively small neural network models using persistent homology has required significant computational resources [16]. Scaling issues are exacerbated by the lack of excision properties and local-to-global patching arguments in common constructions like Vietoris-Rips complexes [27]. There is a critical need for faster algorithms and methods capable of handling high-dimensional data gracefully, potentially by being less sensitive to noise and high dimensionality [14].  

Another significant challenge lies in parameter selection, which affects both the initial TDA computation and the subsequent vectorization steps [14]. The choice of parameters, such as the number of neighbors in constructions or threshold values, can significantly impact the resulting topological features and their downstream utility [5]. Preparing input filtrations in the correct format, avoiding pitfalls like using 0 as a birth time, and selecting appropriate complex types for different data sources also fall under this umbrella [11]. The performance and interpretation of the final vectorized representation are heavily dependent on these choices [5].  

Furthermore, a considerable obstacle is the difficulty in interpreting the meaning of the features within the highdimensional vector spaces produced by certain vectorization methods [14]. Translating abstract topological features—such as those derived from persistent homology—into meaningful insights relevant to the original data or domain (e.g., metallurgical features) remains non-trivial [2]. Even converting specific TDA outputs like cell complexes into effective vector representations for machine learning requires dedicated effort [22]. This interpretability gap hinders the adoption of TDA vectorizations, particularly in applications where understanding the underlying reasons for a model's output is crucial. The challenge of translating theoretically elegant methods into practical applications has also been noted in related fields such as manifold learning [4]. Other challenges include the need for standardized evaluation methods for different algorithms [5,14], assumptions about data structure [5], and the inherent trade-offs between preserving local and global data properties [5]. Integrating topological structures with other data modalities or domain-specific features, such as chemical interactions in molecular data, also presents a challenge [8]. The diversity of structures in complex materials like inorganic compounds necessitates specialized approaches, such as atom-specific persistent homology [13].  

Acknowledging these challenges points towards several promising future research directions for vectorizing topological data. A primary focus involves developing novel vectorization techniques that can better balance expressiveness, stability, and computational efficiency [14]. This includes exploring alternative feature extraction methods from TDA outputs like cell complexes [22] and integrating TDA with existing vectorization pipelines [22]. Investigating the use of distributed embedding methods from text processing, such as Word2Vec or fastText, for persistent homology vectorization is one specific avenue [8]. Developing methods for adaptive parameter selection, like adaptive neighborhood selection algorithms, could mitigate the parameter sensitivity issue [5]. Optimizing memory usage for handling large datasets is also crucial [11].​  

Another important direction is the pursuit of theoretical guarantees on information preservation during the vectorization process [14]. A deeper theoretical understanding of how topological information is encoded and potentially lost during different vectorization steps is essential for developing more robust and reliable methods.  

Further research should explore integrating TDA and its vectorized outputs more tightly and effectively within deep learning architectures [14,18]. This could involve developing topological layers, incorporating topological constraints directly into loss functions [12], or combining topological features with other neural network components like graph convolutional networks or generative adversarial networks [2,12]. Leveraging TDA information to establish relationships between structure and properties, particularly in materials science, offers significant potential for property prediction [13]. Integrating prior topological knowledge can help constrain model search spaces and potentially improve generalization ability [6]. Applying TDA to analyze the topological structures of neural networks themselves and using these features to build predictive models for network generalization is also a promising area [16].  

Extending TDA and vectorization methods to new types of data is also a vital future direction [14]. This includes handling time-varying topological spaces or multi-modal data, requiring methods capable of incorporating temporal dynamics—such as applying time-series analysis techniques like the state space model to persistent homology data [8]. Developing approaches for analyzing and predicting structures with a larger number of elements or complexity, such as larger carbon borane structures, remains an active area [13].​  

Finally, enhancing the interpretability of TDA results and vectorized features is critical for broader adoption. This necessitates developing visualization and explanation tools [14]. Methods like Bayesian optimization can assist in interpreting persistent homology data in specific domains [2]. Improving user-friendly interfaces and expanding the types of complexes supported by TDA software will also facilitate accessibility and interpretation [10,11]. Approximate computation methods offer a way to scale analysis to larger data and models, addressing the computational bottleneck [16,27]. Furthermore, exploring methods that estimate generalization error using topological features—potentially without relying on validation sets—could significantly improve model robustness and reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning [16]. Utilizing hypergraph representations and probabilistic or sheaf-theoretic approaches may also contribute to largescale calculations [27].​  

# 9. Conclusion  

This survey underscores the essential role of vectorization techniques in effectively bridging the gap between the powerful data analysis capabilities of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and the widespread applicability of machine learning algorithms. By transforming topological features, such as persistent homology, into vector representations, TDA outputs become compatible with standard machine learning workflows, enabling researchers to leverage the structural and topological insights provided by TDA for predictive modeling, classification, and analysis [20]. This process allows machine learning models to incorporate a deeper understanding of the geometric and topological structure of data, complementing traditional feature extraction methods [6].​  

While the specific vectorization methodologies discussed in depth were beyond the scope of the provided digests, the general principle involves converting complex topological summaries, such as persistence diagrams or barcodes, into fixedlength numerical vectors. This transformation facilitates their input into machine learning models. Approaches typically fall into categories like kernel-based methods, functional summaries (e.g., persistence landscapes or images), or algebraic methods (e.g., persistence vectors), each possessing relative strengths and weaknesses in terms of computational cost, stability, and representational power. Tools like Perseus assist in the foundational step of computing persistent homology efficiently across various complex types, underpinning many vectorization efforts [10,11].​  

The utility of vectorized TDA features has been demonstrated across a diverse range of applications in science and engineering. In materials science, combining topological mathematics with machine learning enables high-precision prediction models for tasks such as cluster structure analysis, search, and crystal structure energy prediction, accelerating materials discovery [13]. Persistent homology has proven effective in characterizing microstructures, for instance, distinguishing features in pearlite steel [2]. In biological domains, TDA has been applied to analyze complex processes like protein folding, revealing distinct folding paths through persistent homology and novel vectorization approaches like treating topological cycles as "text" for bag-of-simplices vectorization [8]. Vectorized TDA features also contribute to analyzing complex prediction models, aiding in the identification of biologically relevant features and model ambiguities [9]. Furthermore, TDA, particularly persistent homology, has provided new insights into the learning processes of neural networks, offering methods to monitor training convergence without relying solely on validation sets [16]. In image analysis, topological features enhance deep learning models for tasks such as image classification by focusing models on relevant structural features [6], and novel topological loss functions based on persistent homology improve the topological accuracy of image segmentation networks [12]. Related techniques like UMAP and other manifold learning methods are also employed in conjunction with or for analyzing high-dimensional TDA-derived data in fields like bioinformatics [4,17]. The nudged elastic band method, while not directly vectorizing, offers another approach to represent topological information from high-dimensional data that could potentially be integrated with vectorization techniques [22].  

Despite significant progress, several challenges persist in the field of TDA vectorization. Computational efficiency remains a hurdle, particularly for large and high-dimensional datasets. Interpreting the meaning of specific vector components derived from complex topological features can also be challenging, impacting the explainability of downstream machine learning models. Furthermore, method development is an ongoing area of research, with the need for more robust, stable, and discriminative vectorization techniques that are tailored to specific data types and downstream tasks. Integrating domain-specific information, such as chemical properties in protein analysis or time series dynamics, into TDA and its vectorization remains a key challenge [8].  

Looking ahead, the future of TDA vectorization is exciting, offering substantial potential for further methodological innovation and interdisciplinary applications [20]. Opportunities exist for developing novel vectorization techniques that are more computationally efficient, interpretable, and better capture nuanced topological structures. Integrating TDA vectorization with advanced machine learning architectures, such as deep learning, holds promise for achieving higher performance and topological consistency in various tasks [12]. The continued exploration of TDA in diverse fields, from physics and chemistry to social sciences and finance, will undoubtedly drive the demand for sophisticated vectorization methods, fostering ongoing research and development in this dynamic area.​
