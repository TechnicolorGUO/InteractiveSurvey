# 1. Introduction  

The landscape of wireless communication is undergoing a transformative evolution, progressing beyond the Fifth Generation (5G) towards 5G-Advanced (5G-A) and the nascent Sixth Generation (6G) networks. This progression is driven by the escalating demand for enhanced capabilities and new services, including haptic telemedicine, immersive VR/AR remote experiences, holographic teleportation (eXtended reality - XR), and ubiquitous connectivity for massive nodes [4,11,21]. Future networks must support stringent key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Gb/s data rates, centimeter-level localization accuracy, microsecond-level latency, and significantly improved energy efficiency to enable diverse applications like intelligent transportation, smart security, industrial IoT, and autonomous driving [4,7,21]. Traditional wireless systems, designed primarily for communication or sensing independently, face limitations in meeting these multifaceted demands, particularly concerning inefficient spectrum utilization and the inability to fully leverage the synergy between these functionalities [12,30,33].  

In response to these challenges and evolving requirements, Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal technology for 5G-A and 6G [2,3,7,17]. ISAC integrates wireless communication and sensing functions into a unified system, often on the same platform, through shared hardware, optimized signal processing algorithms, and fused data flows [2]. This concept is also known by various alternative terminologies, including Dual-Functional Radar-Communication (DFRC), Joint Radar-Communication (JRC), Joint Communication-Radar (JCR), RadCom, and Radar and Communication Spectrum Sharing (RCSS) or Communications-Radar Spectrum Sharing (CRSS) [15,32].  

The core motivations behind ISAC are rooted in the pursuit of enhanced performance and efficiency.

By integrating sensing and communication, ISAC systems can achieve more efficient spectrum utilization and resource allocation, reduced hardware complexity, and lower power consumption compared to separate systems [11,12,32,33]. Furthermore, ISAC enables a profound synergy between the two functions: sensory data can significantly aid communication tasks such as beam management and resource allocation, while communication capabilities facilitate realtime network sensing and data sharing among devices and infrastructure [33]. This integration allows networks to move beyond simple data transmission to reconstructing and representing the physical world, turning the network infrastructure itself into a pervasive sensing platform [8,9]. This capability supports a wide range of advanced applications in automotive, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robotics, smart cities, and industrial automation, enabling device-based or device-free positioning, imaging, environment reconstruction, and gesture recognition [9,11,12]. The ITU has recognized ISAC as a new scenario for 6G (IMT-2030), emphasizing its role in providing improved services and new capabilities through integration [2,14].​

Despite the substantial potential, the development and deployment of ISAC systems present several key challenges and opportunities. Balancing the inherent trade-offs between communication rates and sensing resolution or accuracy is a fundamental technical hurdle [11,13]. Resource reuse and spectrum sharing require careful design to manage interference and optimize joint performance [11,12]. Practical waveform design for dual functionality, particularly achieving globally optimal constant modulus waveforms, remains an active research area [11,25,32]. Integrating sensing capabilities requires enhancing core network architecture and defining how sensing data is distributed and exposed [17]. Furthermore, addressing privacy and security concerns in integrated systems is crucial, necessitating a security-by-design approach, especially in heterogeneous IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) environments [4,11,20]. Technical challenges also include designing energy-efficient networks and coordinating multi-node or multi-base station cooperative ISAC schemes to improve coverage and capacity [2,3,27]. These challenges simultaneously represent significant opportunities for research, driving innovation in areas such as advanced signal processing, resource management, network architecture design, physical layer security, and the application of data-driven methods like machine learning to overcome the limitations of classical approaches [2,4,13,17].​  

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Integrated Sensing and Communication for 5G-A and 6G. It explores the foundational concepts, diverse terminologies, and compelling motivations driving ISAC research. We summarize the current research status, existing network architectures, and key enabling technologies, delving into areas such as waveform design, resource allocation, and physical layer security [2,3,4,11,30]. The survey also discusses the significant technical challenges, potential solutions, and future development directions for ISAC in future wireless networks.

Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) represents a pivotal design paradigm and an enabling technology that facilitates the co-existence and cooperation of sensing and communication functionalities within a unified system [31]. This integration is fundamentally achieved through the shared utilization of radio waves [17]. While communication leverages radio waves for information transfer (e.g., voice, video, data), sensing employs them to ascertain states and characteristics of the physical environment, including parameters like position, speed, shape, and distance [17]. The overarching objective is to effectively leverage congested wireless and hardware resources, potentially yielding mutual performance benefits [31]. ISAC is recognized under various terminologies, such as Joint Radar Communication (JRC), Joint Communication and Radar Sensing (JCAS), and Dual-Functional Radar-Communication (DFRC) [22,31,32,35].  

The core principle of ISAC involves the integration of wireless communication and sensing functions on a shared platform. This is accomplished by sharing hardware resources, optimizing processing algorithms, and integrating data processing flows to enable mutual coordination and assistance [3]. Unlike conventional approaches where radar and communication systems operate independently, ISAC systems aim to perform both functions without necessitating explicit information exchange between separate units [32]. This inherent integration leads to fundamental trade-offs between communication performance (e.g., data rate, reliability) and sensing performance (e.g., detection accuracy, resolution) [11,13]. Optimizing system design requires careful consideration and management of these trade-offs [13].  

![](images/3115ceb47b6cdc29991ada1ba892f8e310063cef7e9a22561dfe3912992d19a2.jpg)  

Different design approaches prioritize the balance between communication and sensing functionalities. Sensing-centric design (SCD) primarily focuses on maximizing sensing performance, whereas communication-centric design (CCD) prioritizes communication performance [10]. Joint design, conversely, seeks to strike a balance and optimize both aspects simultaneously [10]. Joint Radar-Communication (JCR), for instance, is often considered a subset of DFRC where communication is the primary design driver [25]. Achieving cooperative design without degrading the performance of either function remains a significant challenge in such systems [25]. These integrated design approaches, particularly DFRC, are distinct from coexistence designs like Radar-Communication Coexistence (RCC), where separate radar and communication systems share spectrum but require complex interference mitigation, management, and centralized control [4,12,15]. DFRC, utilizing a shared hardware platform and integrated processing, offers higher hardware and spectrum efficiency [4,11].​  

Compared to separate communication and sensing systems, ISAC offers substantial advantages in terms of resource utilization and overall system efficiency. By sharing hardware platforms, ISAC can reduce modem size and cost [11] and contribute to hardware reuse and a reduced carbon footprint [21]. Dynamic resource allocation in ISAC systems further optimizes resource utilization [11]. The ability to more accurately concentrate wireless signal energy in specific directions enhances communication efficiency through intelligent resource allocation and optimizes both communication and sensing systems [33]. Furthermore, ISAC enables systems to acquire high-precision information about the physical environment, which can be directly used to aid communication—for example, by providing real-time radio propagation characteristics to improve beamforming performance and achieve higher spectral efficiency and more robust networks [8,22]. This capability supports high-precision observation and reconstruction of the physical world, essential for future systems like 6G and enabling intelligent connections for everything [17]. Applications span various sectors including industrial automation, smart healthcare, smart transportation, warehousing, and logistics [16], and leverage new frequency bands like THz for highprecision imaging and sensing in challenging environments [9].​  

# 3. System Models and Network Architectures  

The design and implementation of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems are intrinsically linked to the underlying system models and network architectures deployed within 5G-Advanced (5G-A) and 6G frameworks. This section provides an overview of the fundamental aspects covered in the subsequent sub-sections, encompassing system models, performance evaluation, network architectural paradigms, multi-base station cooperation, and the critical aspects of network integration and evolution.  

The foundation of ISAC analysis lies in defining appropriate system models, which vary significantly depending on the specific technology and application. Examples include optical wireless (ISAC-OW) systems utilizing visible light and infrared spectra [19] and various radio frequency (RF) configurations such as those employing uniform linear arrays (ULA) for multiuser communication and radar sensing [7,32] or bistatic radar setups [25]. Channel modeling plays a vital role in predicting system performance, although detailed analyses across diverse channel environments (e.g., fading, shadowing, multipath) and their impact on ISAC trade-offs in different deployment scenarios are not extensively covered in the provided materials.  

Abstract channel representations, such as a channel matrix $\mathbf { H } \in \mathbb { C } ^ { K \times N }$ for $K$ users and $N$ transmit antennas, are employed in some models [32].  

Evaluating ISAC systems requires a suite of performance metrics that capture both communication and sensing capabilities. Communication performance is typically assessed via metrics like data rate [19] or bit error rate (BER) [25]. Sensing performance is quantified using measures such as accuracy (e.g., localization precision, vital sign monitoring accuracy) [19] and mean-square error (MSE) [25], or metrics for intermediate processes like channel estimation using Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) [7]. The selection of these metrics depends heavily on the specific ISAC application and the functionalities being evaluated.​  

Different network architectures provide the structural basis for implementing ISAC functionalities, each presenting distinct trade-offs in terms of scalability, complexity, and overall performance [2,17,29,30,31]. These paradigms can be broadly categorized as centralized, distributed [2], and hybrid architectures. Centralized architectures offer coordinated control but can face scalability issues, while distributed architectures push processing to the edge, improving scalability and robustness [2]. Hybrid approaches seek to combine the benefits of both. Within the 6G context, specific architectural proposals like the "Three-Body Four-Layer Five-Facet," "Three-Layer Three-Facet," and the IMT-2030 6G network system architecture have been discussed, each with varying layers and functional bodies to support diverse ISAC requirements [2,3].​  

Multi-base station cooperative architectures are particularly important for expanding ISAC coverage and enhancing performance beyond the limitations of single-base station systems [2,8]. These architectures, such as those leveraging coordinated multi-point (CoMP) based sensing [16], enable joint data transmission and information sharing to improve coverage, capacity, and sensing accuracy through diverse perspectives and resources [2,8]. Key mechanisms for coordination include Coordinated Beamforming (CB) and Joint Processing (JP), offering different trade-offs in backhaul requirements and performance gains [2,3]. Implementing these cooperative architectures introduces challenges such as achieving tight synchronization between base stations and managing the efficient exchange of large volumes of data at different collaboration levels (signal, symbol, or data level) [2].​  

Integrating ISAC functionalities into existing [30] and future mobile network standards necessitates significant evolution, particularly concerning the core network [17] and the incorporation of edge computing [16]. Modifications to the core network architecture, such as the introduction of dual-bus solutions for handling distinct sensing data flows, are required to support end-to-end ISAC processes [17]. Furthermore, dynamic routing and resource management are essential, especially in heterogeneous environments like space-air-ground integrated networks [1,3,26]. The integration of edge computing is crucial for providing the low-latency processing and real-time analytics needed for many sensing applications, facilitating convergence of communication and computing closer to the data source [1,16]. These network evolutions are fundamental to realizing the full potential of ISAC in providing multidimensional services beyond traditional communication.​  

# 3.1 System Models and Performance Metrics  

The effectiveness and evaluation of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems are fundamentally shaped by the choice of system models and performance metrics. Different system architectures necessitate distinct modeling approaches and evaluation criteria. For instance, an ISAC system designed for optical wireless (ISAC-OW) employs optical signals for both communication and sensing functionalities, supporting applications such as robot localization and contactless health monitoring [19]. In contrast, radio frequency (RF) based ISAC systems may utilize antenna arrays, such as a uniform linear array (ULA) with $\big \backslash \big ( \mathsf { N } \big \backslash \big )$ antennas serving \( K \) single-antenna users [32], or adopt a bistatic radar configuration where a single receiver serves both communication and radar sensing purposes [25].  

The underlying channel model is crucial for predicting system behavior, although the provided digests offer limited explicit analysis on the impact of specific channel impairments like fading, shadowing, or detailed multipath propagation on overall ISAC performance. Some studies represent the wireless channel abstractly, for example, using a matrix  

for \( K \) users and $\big \backslash \big ( \mathsf { N } \big \backslash \big )$ transmit antennas [32]. Other models incorporate details such as complex channel gain, Doppler shift, and delay for each path, considering the channel as time-variant with per-tap linear phase variations due to Doppler effects [25]. However, a comprehensive analysis comparing the performance implications of different channel environments (e.g., dense urban with significant multipath versus rural with dominant line-of-sight) based on these specific models is not detailed within the provided digests. Similarly, the trade-offs between communication and sensing performance across  

varying deployment scenarios like urban, suburban, or rural environments are not explicitly addressed in the available materials.  

Evaluating ISAC systems requires metrics that capture performance in both communication and sensing domains, which can vary significantly depending on the system's design and application. Communication performance is commonly assessed using metrics like data rate, as demonstrated by the evaluation of video transmission capability in an ISAC-OW system [19], or the bit error rate (BER), which is a standard measure in communication systems [25]. Sensing performance, on the other hand, can be quantified by metrics such as sensing accuracy, exemplified by centimeter-level precision for localization or accuracy in monitoring heartbeat and breathing rates [19]. Mean-square error (MSE) is another metric used to evaluate sensing performance, particularly in radar-sensing tasks [25]. Beyond direct communication and sensing outcomes, performance metrics can also evaluate intermediate processes critical for system operation, such as channel estimation, where the Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) is employed to compare the efficacy of different estimation methods [7]. Comparing these metrics reveals that while BER and data rate are standard communication benchmarks, sensing performance metrics like accuracy and MSE are more application-specific. The choice among accuracy, MSE, and NMSE depends on whether one is evaluating the final sensing output, the fidelity of channel measurements, or the performance of specific signal processing tasks within the sensing chain. The diversity in reported metrics underscores the multifaceted nature of ISAC performance evaluation, requiring selection based on the specific goals and functionalities of the system under consideration.  

# 3.2 Network Architectures (Centralized, Distributed, Hybrid)  

![](images/701839a4384710c4276fe351b81b9133acc947f19c318056476110e97eb0edfc.jpg)  

The underlying network architecture plays a crucial role in enabling Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) functionalities within 5G-Advanced (5G-A) and 6G systems. Different architectural paradigms, broadly categorized as centralized, distributed, and hybrid, offer distinct advantages and disadvantages concerning scalability, complexity, and performance, directly influencing their suitability for various ISAC applications and deployment scenarios [2,17].​  

Within the evolving landscape of 6G network design, several architectural frameworks have been proposed to accommodate the integration of diverse functionalities, including ISAC. Among these, the “three-body four-layer fivesided” and the “three-layer three-sided” architectures present distinct structural approaches [2]. The “three-body fourlayer five-sided” architecture is characterized by three main bodies: the network body, the management orchestration body, and the digital twin body. This structure facilitates network function operation, intelligent resource autonomy, and the interaction mapping between physical and virtual entities [2]. This sophisticated structure, particularly the inclusion of a digital twin body, suggests potential benefits for ISAC applications requiring detailed environmental mapping, predictive resource management, and complex cross-domain interactions. In contrast, the “three-layer three-sided” architecture comprises a ubiquitous cloud network facility layer, a fusion orchestration management layer, and an agile business service layer [2]. This architecture emphasizes the provision of customized business service capabilities built upon a flexible, cloudbased infrastructure [2]. Comparing these two, the “three-body four-layer five-sided” architecture appears more oriented towards intelligent, self-managing networks leveraging digital representations for complex operations like coordinated sensing and control, while the “three-layer three-sided” architecture focuses on agile, service-centric deployments readily adaptable to diverse ISAC service requirements through cloud infrastructure.​  

Another relevant framework is the IMT-2030 6G network system architecture, structured into an infrastructure resource layer, a network function layer, an application and opening layer, and security and management functions [2]. This layered approach provides a clear separation of concerns, potentially simplifying the integration of ISAC functionalities at different levels, such as deploying sensing-specific network functions or exposing sensing data and control interfaces via the application and opening layer.  

Distributed network architectures, where processing and decision-making capabilities are pushed closer to the network edge (e.g., base stations, edge servers), offer significant benefits for ISAC, including enhanced scalability, improved robustness, and extended coverage [2]. In a distributed ISAC architecture involving multi-base station collaboration, individual base stations or groups can perform localized sensing tasks and initial data processing, reducing backhaul load and latency. This distribution inherently increases scalability as more nodes can be added to expand sensing coverage or capacity. Robustness is enhanced because the failure of a single node does not typically cripple the entire system. Furthermore, leveraging sensing capabilities distributed across numerous base stations improves overall coverage and provides diverse perspectives for more accurate sensing and localization [2].  

Integrating ISAC functionalities into the 6G core network architecture is a critical consideration [17]. The evolution towards a more flexible and distributed core, potentially involving placing core network function entities on non-terrestrial platforms like satellites, as discussed in the context of 5G-A and 6G satellite networks [1], highlights this trend. The Framework for IMT2020 networks and beyond (ITU-T Y.3201) proposes architectures like FMSC, which support necessary and optional core network functions on satellite [1]. This distribution of core functions allows for lightweight customization and integration options [1]. Integrating ISAC capabilities into such a distributed core would enable centralized coordination of sensing tasks across geographically dispersed or diverse network segments (terrestrial and non-terrestrial), aggregation and processing of sensing data from multiple sources, and intelligent resource management for joint communication and sensing operations. This necessitates careful consideration of interfaces, protocols, and computational resources within the core network.  

Hybrid network architectures combine elements of both centralized and distributed approaches to balance the trade-offs between complexity, scalability, and performance. For ISAC, a hybrid architecture could involve centralized control and resource orchestration at the core or regional data centers, while pushing sensing signal processing, local data fusion, and low-latency decision-making to the network edge [2]. This approach leverages the global view and resource pooling capabilities of centralized coordination for complex analysis while benefiting from the low latency and bandwidth efficiency of distributed processing for time-critical ISAC tasks like obstacle detection or gesture recognition. Such architectures can be tailored to specific ISAC applications, optimizing performance based on requirements for latency, accuracy, coverage, and computational load.​  

# 3.3 Multi-Base Station Cooperative ISAC Architectures  

Multi-base station (multi-BS) cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers significant advantages over single-base station ISAC, particularly in expanding coverage, increasing network capacity, and enhancing sensing accuracy [2,8]. While single-base station ISAC systems, such as those employing hybrid radar fusion in a dual-functional base station using downlink and uplink contributions for angle-of-arrival estimation [11], are effective within limited ranges, cooperative multi-BS systems can reduce measurement uncertainty and provide greater sensing coverage, higher accuracy, and improved resolution by leveraging diverse perspectives and resources [8]. This collaboration enables advanced sensing capabilities like dual-base and multi-base perception [8], including Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) based sensing [16].  

Several multi-base station cooperative architectures have been proposed to facilitate ISAC operations. One such architecture is the "Three-Body Four-Layer Five-Facet" structure, where a dedicated management and orchestration body intelligently manages resources and services for communication-sensing fusion, optimizing operational efficiency. It relies on a communication and computing power layer for efficient data exchange and processing, and a routing and connection layer to dynamically optimize base station connections, ensuring adaptive service scheduling [2]. Another approach, the "Three-Layer Three-Facet" architecture, utilizes a ubiquitous cloud network facility layer for foundational network and service capabilities, supporting signal transmission between base stations. A fusion orchestration management layer ensures efficient resource management and scheduling, while an intelligent endogenous surface facilitates data collection and intelligent analysis for dynamic deployment adjustments [2]. The IMT-2030 6G Network System Architecture provides a broader framework, featuring an infrastructure resource layer for base station deployment and diverse access methods, and a network function layer enhanced with AI, sensing, data, and computing functions to support ISAC [2].  

These architectures enable sophisticated coordination and data sharing mechanisms crucial for enhancing network performance. Coordinated Beamforming (CB) is one such mechanism, where user data originates from the serving base station, and beamforming is coordinated among adjacent base stations to manage interference on shared time-frequency resources [2,3]. In contrast, Joint Processing (JP) involves multiple base stations sharing user data information, allowing for joint transmission or reception to significantly improve the received signal quality and boost capacity [2,3]. Multi-base station cooperative transceiver modes further extend capabilities, including self-transmit self-receive, where a station transmits and receives; A-transmit B-receive, where one station transmits and another receives; and hybrid transmit-receive modes combining these functionalities [2,3].​  

Analyzing these architectures reveals inherent trade-offs. Architectures with more layers or bodies, such as the "Three-Body Four-Layer Five-Facet" model, may offer enhanced orchestration and resource management capabilities through explicit functional separation, potentially leading to optimized performance for complex ISAC tasks. However, this complexity can also increase implementation challenges and require more sophisticated coordination protocols. Simpler layered architectures like the "Three-Layer Three-Facet" might offer better scalability and potentially lower complexity by integrating functions within fewer layers, leveraging cloud infrastructure for flexibility. The IMT-2030 framework provides a flexible foundation adaptable to various ISAC implementations by enhancing core network functions, but its performance is highly dependent on the specific technologies and coordination algorithms deployed within the layers. Comparing CB and JP, JP offers potentially higher capacity and signal quality gains through centralized data sharing and processing but demands more backhaul capacity and tighter synchronization than CB, which focuses on interference avoidance with distributed data handling.​  

Implementing multi-BS cooperative ISAC architectures presents significant challenges. A critical requirement is tight synchronization among base stations to enable coherent signal processing for both communication and sensing tasks [2]. Achieving high-precision sensing, such as localization through phase difference measurements between base stations, explicitly relies on accurate synchronization [19]. Furthermore, efficient data exchange protocols are essential to support the rapid and reliable sharing of large volumes of sensing and communication data between collaborating base stations, especially in JP modes, which can otherwise lead to high backhaul load and processing latency [2].  

![](images/37f90471f07cd5194d54fb9cdf4c827c0e11fda2b688d300dad24ac450440d0a.jpg)  

Collaboration levels in multi-base station ISAC can be categorized based on the degree of raw data pre-processing before sharing: signal level, symbol level, and data level [2]. Signal level collaboration involves sharing raw or minimally processed baseband signals (e.g., I/Q samples) among base stations, enabling joint coherent processing for maximum sensing and communication gain but requiring very high backhaul capacity and precise synchronization. Symbol level collaboration involves sharing decoded or detected symbols, which reduces backhaul load compared to signal level but limits the potential for coherent processing gains. Data level collaboration involves sharing high-level information or processed features derived from local sensing and communication, such as detected object parameters or channel state information estimates. This minimizes data exchange requirements but may sacrifice precision and flexibility compared to lower-level collaboration. These different levels offer varying trade-offs between performance, complexity, synchronization requirements, and backhaul load, influencing the design choices for specific multi-BS ISAC applications and architectures.  

# 3.4 Network Integration and Evolution  

Supporting integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) functionalities necessitates significant evolution and modifications to the core network architecture, data routing mechanisms, and service integration frameworks. A fundamental requirement is adapting the core network to effectively handle the unique data flows and processing demands introduced by sensing capabilities.  

![](images/34a5bf99323882a4ddf076d2eb3b40727d266d52738e73fc9082c95cdc3a98a6.jpg)  

One proposed approach enhances the existing 5G Service-Based Architecture (SBA) by incorporating a dual‐bus solution [17]. This architecture utilizes a Data Channel Interface (DCI) bus specifically for transmitting large volumes of raw sensing data, while a Service‐Based Interface (SBI) is designated for conveying sensing measurements or higher‐level results [17]. Such a design is crucial for managing the diverse data types and scales associated with ISAC and requires robust implementation methods for supporting end‐to‐end sensing and exposure processes within the core network [17].  

Efficient data routing is paramount in ISAC networks, particularly in complex or cooperative scenarios. For multi‐base station cooperative ISAC, dynamic optimization of connection routing between base stations is essential to effectively support the implementation of communication and sensing integrated technology and ensure adaptive scheduling and optimal connection of services [1,3,26]. In heterogeneous network environments, such as space–air–ground integrated networks, routing strategies must account for time‐varying network topologies and be jointly optimized with the deployment of virtual network functions to enable multi‐dimensional resource integration and sharing, thereby ensuring the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of different types of tasks [1,3,26]. These advancements in routing and resource management highlight the need for enhanced control plane functionalities capable of orchestrating communication and sensing resources dynamically across the network. Specific core network process and protocol enhancements have been explored, for instance, within the context of satellite network integration in 3GPP Release 17 and 18, addressing aspects like satellite access/backhaul and mobility, which contribute to the foundation for integrating diverse network components for ISAC [1,3,26].​  

The integration of edge computing resources is pivotal for enabling low‐latency processing and real‐time decision‐ making for ISAC applications. The convergence of mobile networks and computing at the edge is seen as a key enabler for unlocking new opportunities in the 6G era [16]. Edge computing facilitates the necessary low‐latency processing of sensing data, supports sophisticated data analytics closer to the source, and enables real‐time responses crucial for many sensing‐assisted services [16]. This integration is critical in various scenarios, including supporting edge computing functionalities in satellite‐integrated networks [1] and providing the required communication and computing power layer for efficient data exchange and processing between multiple base stations engaged in cooperative ISAC activities [1,3].  

These architectural evolutions significantly impact network performance and scalability. The increased volume of sensing data and the computational demands for processing and fusion necessitate scalable network designs and efficient resource orchestration. The management and orchestration body in cooperative ISAC architectures, for instance, is responsible for intelligently arranging and managing resources and services to optimize the operational efficiency of communication and sensing fusion technology [3]. Ultimately, these architectural advancements are fundamental to enabling the true  

convergence of communication and sensing. The design of 6G network architecture is considered vital, aiming to natively support features like AI and ISAC to provide users with multidimensional services that extend beyond traditional communication [16]. Architectures supporting dynamic routing and multi‐dimensional resource integration across integrated networks underscore the efforts to build a unified platform capable of simultaneously handling diverse communication and sensing requirements [3,26].  

# 4. Key Enabling Technologies  

Realizing the vision of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) for 5G-Advanced (5G-A) and 6G necessitates the development and integration of several key enabling technologies. These technologies are fundamental to designing systems capable of concurrently performing communication and sensing tasks efficiently and effectively. The successful implementation of ISAC relies heavily on innovations across various layers of the wireless system, from signal generation and processing to network-level resource management and the exploitation of new frequency bands and hardware paradigms [2,11,15,16,31,32].  

A critical foundation lies in Waveform and Signal Design, where the objective is to develop signals that satisfy the oftenconflicting requirements of communication throughput and sensing accuracy [6,11,16,28,32]. This involves classifying and comparing different waveform design techniques, analyzing the inherent trade-offs between communication and sensing performance, while also considering complexity and hardware limitations [11,15,16,31,32]. Specific waveforms, such as those based on CP-OFDM and FMCW, are explored for their suitability in ISAC scenarios, highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages [8]. The design space includes sensing-centric, communication-centric, and joint approaches, each with distinct priorities [10].​  

Multi-Antenna Techniques are indispensable for enhancing ISAC performance by enabling sophisticated spatial processing. Techniques like beamforming and MIMO are crucial for improving sensing range and resolution, as well as increasing communication capacity and coverage [11,13,16,18,23,35]. This involves optimizing beamforming for simultaneous communication and sensing, particularly in single-user, multi-user, and multi-base station cooperative ISAC systems [2,3,11,15,16,28]. Beamspace MIMO radar and beam tracking are highlighted as fundamental techniques [13].  

Effective Resource Allocation and Interference Management are paramount for ensuring that communication and sensin functionalities can coexist and operate efficiently within the same spectrum and hardware infrastructure [2,3,11,12,15]. Various resource management strategies, including orthogonal and multiplexing approaches, are employed, and their impact on resource utilization, throughput, and interference levels must be analyzed [2,3,32]. This necessitates sophisticated interference mitigation techniques, including various spectrum sharing approaches like radar and communication spectrum sharing (RCSS) and null-space projection (NSP) precoding, to handle mutual interference and clutter [2,12,15,28,31,32]. Symbol-level precoding is also being explored as a technique to potentially utilize interference [21].​  

Accurate Channel Estimation and Modeling are critical for the design and performance optimization of ISAC systems, especially in dynamic and challenging propagation environments [7,8,12,22]. The integration of sensing capabilities allows for novel approaches to channel estimation that leverage environmental information or sensing data as prior knowledge to improve accuracy and efficiency [7,8]. Techniques for channel estimation leveraging environmental or sensing information are compared, highlighting the importance of capturing the complex interplay between the environment and signal propagation for both communication and sensing [8]. Channel sounding and AI-powered approaches are emerging tools in this domain [18,22].​  

Finally, Emerging Technologies, such as the utilization of millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) frequency bands and the deployment of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), are poised to significantly enhance ISAC capabilities in 6G [9,10,13,22,27]. These technologies offer opportunities for wider bandwidths, higher resolution sensing, and intelligent control over the wireless environment, but also introduce unique challenges related to signal propagation, hardware design, and integration that require dedicated research and development [10,18,22,27]. Hardware integration, including shared baseband and RF components, is also a key focus for improving efficiency and reducing complexity [8,12,21].  

The following subsections delve into each of these critical technology areas in detail.  

# 4.1 Waveform and Signal Design  

Waveform and signal design is recognized as a fundamental technology for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, particularly critical for advancements in 6G and beyond networks [16,21]. The development of practical waveform designs is crucial for dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) systems, such as those integrated into 6G cellular base stations [11]. The primary objective in ISAC waveform design is to achieve efficient solutions that simultaneously satisfy conflicting communication and sensing requirements, often necessitating the use of optimization frameworks that account for uncertainties like imperfect channel state information (CSI) and hardware limitations [11].​  

DFRC waveform designs are broadly categorized into three approaches: sensing-centric design (SCD), communicationcentric design (CCD), and joint design, each prioritizing performance metrics differently [10]. Optimal waveform design is a key focus, considering various aspects such as omnidirectional and directional beam patterns, as well as specific waveform properties like constant modulus [28,32].​  

Various waveform techniques have been explored for ISAC applications. One notable approach is the development of joint communication and radar (JCR) waveforms based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing with Index Modulation (OFDM-IM) [25]. In this scheme, information is encoded not only through conventional Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) symbols but also via the indices of active subcarriers within subblocks [25]. To enhance radar functionality, Golay complementary sequences (GCS) are embedded within the OFDM-IM waveform, leveraging their desirable ambiguity function characteristics [25]. This design offers flexibility in utilizing the entire bandwidth for radar processing, akin to frequency-agile radar systems [25]. For this OFDM-IM based JCR waveform, the number of radar symbols R within an OFDM symbol, given N total subcarriers, r radar subcarriers, and subblock size g, can be expressed as  

$$
R = { \frac { r N } { g } }
$$  

[25]. The number of bits $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { b } }$ transmitted per subblock with $\mathsf { k }$ communication subcarriers and Q QAM constellations is given by $b = b _ { 1 } + b _ { 2 } = \lfloor \log _ { 2 } { \binom { g } { k } } \rfloor + k \log _ { 2 } { Q }$  

where b₁ bits select active subcarriers and $b _ { 2 }$ bits modulate QAM symbols [25].  

Other research areas include constant modulus waveform design with low correlation sidelobes, spectrally compatible waveform design under integrated sidelobe level (ISL) and Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) constraints, and binary waveform design optimized for transmit beampattern performance, particularly in the context of MIMO radar [28]. Joint design approaches, such as the combined design of OFDM sequences and mismatch filters under spectral constraints, are also investigated to balance performance trade-offs [28]. Unified waveforms, hardware architectures, and signal processing algorithms are being developed to jointly enable high-speed communication, such as video transmission, and precise sensing, like centimeter-level indoor localization [19].​  

For communication-centric ISAC designs, particularly for ranging, the analysis of sensing performance relies on metrics derived from periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF), with the expectation of the integrated sidelobe level (EISL) serving as a key sensing performance indicator [26]. Research has shown that OFDM modulation demonstrates optimal ranging sidelobe performance for QAM and PSK constellations among communication waveforms incorporating a cyclic prefix (CP), achieving the lowest EISL and minimal sidelobe levels at individual P-ACF lags [26]. Furthermore, OFDM is locally optimal for QAM/PSK waveforms without CP, minimizing the EISL of the A-ACF [26].

Designing waveforms that simultaneously satisfy the disparate requirements of communication and sensing presents significant challenges. Common key requirements that need careful consideration include PAPR, out-of-band leakage, complexity, power consumption, and spectrum flexibility [8]. PAPR is a critical factor affecting power amplifier efficiency, while low out-of-band leakage is essential for spectral compatibility. Balancing these with the need for sufficient spectral resources for sensing, reflected in parameters like bandwidth and spectral efficiency, is a fundamental trade-off [8,28].  

Moreover, pilot and sequence design for multiplexing poses a challenge [8]. Communication pilots are typically designed for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, whereas sensing detection often necessitates coherent accumulation of signals to achieve performance in low SNR environments, especially when dealing with small scatterers [8]. This divergence places stringent demands on system synchronization and stability for effective ISAC operation [8]. The choice of digital modulation schemes for ISAC is another key area, involving trade-offs and challenges specific to integrating sensing capabilities [27]. Overall, waveform design for ISAC necessitates carefully navigating trade-offs between communication and sensing performance objectives, considering various waveform parameters and system constraints [8].  

# 4.2 Multi-Antenna Techniques

Multi-antenna techniques, encompassing methods such as beamforming and spatial multiplexing, represent a pivotal technology for advancing the performance of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems [11,16]. These techniques are critical for concurrently enhancing sensing range, accuracy, and communication data rates [13]. MultipleInput Multiple-Output (MIMO) configurations and multi-node cooperation are recognized as effective strategies to concurrently improve spectral efficiency and sensing precision, necessitating ISAC waveform designs compatible with these architectures [8]. Examples of practical implementations include the use of a MIMO system with $N$ transmit antennas serving $K$ single-antenna users [32], and a uniform linear array (ULA) employing distinct antenna configurations for radar (24 transmit-receive antennas) and communication (128 antennas, 16 RF chains) modules at the base station [7]. Massive MIMO, as demonstrated by commercial products like Ericsson's Air 3266 and AIR 3285, is widely adopted to enhance network capacity and coverage, principles equally applicable to ISAC [23].​  

Multi-antenna techniques directly contribute to performance enhancement through precise signal manipulation. Beamforming, for instance, is employed to optimize network operation in frequency ranges like FR3 and sub-THz bands [22]. Research explores MIMO beamforming designs aimed at maximizing beampattern gain in Dual-functional RadarCommunication (DFRC) systems, thereby improving both radar and communication capabilities [35]. Hybrid beamforming techniques, including designs based on double-phase-shifter structures, manifold optimization, and symbol-level precoding with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), are also investigated for DFRC systems [28]. The application and design of beamforming products represent a focused area of study [29]. Furthermore, beamspace MIMO radar and beam tracking are highlighted as techniques fundamental to enhancing both communication and sensing performance [13]. Advanced prototypes demonstrate the use of specific MIMO arrays, such as a 4TX16R configuration for millimeter-level sensing and imaging, and a 2x2 polarized MIMO for high-speed communication. Techniques like virtual aperture MIMO are proposed to achieve high imaging resolution without increasing physical terminal size by utilizing terminal movement to form a larger equivalent aperture [9].  

While multi-antenna techniques offer substantial benefits, their implementation in ISAC systems presents several challenges. These include issues related to hardware complexity and the overhead associated with channel estimation [11]. Specific design challenges arise in millimeter-wave phased arrays, particularly in bands like the D-Band, for combined communication and sensing applications [18,27]. Optimization problems inherent in multi-antenna ISAC system design are complex. For instance, MIMO transmit beamforming for joint radar sensing and multi-user communication can be formulated as an optimization problem targeting a weighted combination of sum rate and Cramer-Rao bound, subject to transmit power constraints [26]. Adaptive beamforming also faces challenges such as steering vector mismatches caused by imperfect array calibration or modeling errors, addressed by approaches like worst-case interference-plus-noise power minimization under robust constraints [26]. The design of coherence among multiple antennas is another research focus [28].​  

The application of multi-antenna techniques extends to Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) or multi-base station (MBS) ISAC systems, identified as a key technology area [16]. In MBS cooperative ISAC, multi-antenna technology is crucial for enhancing both communication and sensing capabilities [2]. This involves sophisticated multi-base station beam management strategies, including joint beam alignment, beam tracking, and beam coverage, aimed at improving signal accuracy and coverage across the network [2,3]. Designing coherent multi-antenna systems in an MBS context poses particular challenges [2]. Different multi-antenna signal coherence design modes exist, each with distinct advantages and complexities:​  

1. Fully Coherent Multi-Base Station Signal Design: This mode emphasizes precise signal precoding and synchronization across different base stations to achieve coherent signal superposition at the receiver, thereby maximizing reception quality and system performance [2,3].​   
2. Incoherent Multi-Base Station Signal Design: Here, the signal correlation between base stations is designed to be zero. Signals primarily adhere to the orthogonal principle, reducing reliance on strict time and phase synchronization between base stations, thus simplifying coordination [2,3].​   
3. Partially Coherent Multi-Base Station Signal Design: This approach seeks a balance between the high performance of fully coherent design and the low complexity of incoherent design. It utilizes coherence among a subset of base stations to improve signal quality while mitigating the stringent requirements for perfect channel information and synchronization [2,3].​  

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) also play a role in multi-antenna ISAC systems, particularly in enhancing radar capabilities for localizing multiple targets [11]. Challenges exist in formulating optimization problems for updating RIS phase shifters, especially when the number of targets is unknown [11]. RIS can provide significant performance gains; in single-user scenarios, the received SNR can be proportional to the square of the number of RIS elements $( N )$ , illustrating a substantial power gain (e.g., doubling RIS elements yields a 6 dB gain). However, the power received via the RIS channel is subject to a dual path loss law, inversely proportional to the product of path losses from transmitter to RIS and RIS to receiver [10].​  

# 4.3 Resource Allocation and Interference Management  

Efficient resource allocation and robust interference management are paramount for realizing the potential of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, particularly within the dense and dynamic environments envisioned for 5GAdvanced and 6G [11]. These challenges necessitate sophisticated techniques to optimize the simultaneous demands of communication and sensing tasks while minimizing mutual interference. Radar and Communication Spectrum Sharing (RCSS) presents a key approach to addressing the increasing demand for wireless spectrum, facilitating spectral cohabitation and enabling joint system designs capable of both functionalities [15].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Strategy</td><td>Description</td><td>Domain Separation</td><td>Pros</td><td>Cons</td></tr><tr><td>Orthogonal</td><td>Separating Communication and Sensing signals.</td><td>Time, Frequency, or Spatial</td><td>Simplifies interference avoidance.</td><td>May not fully exploit spectral efficiency.</td></tr><tr><td>Multiplexing</td><td>Sharing the same Time, Frequency, or Spatial resources.</td><td>Shared</td><td>Potentially more spectrally efficient.</td><td>Introduces significant interference challenges.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Resource management strategies in ISAC can be broadly categorized into orthogonal and multiplexing approaches [2,3]. Orthogonal resource allocation segregates communication and sensing signals in the time, frequency, or spatial domains to prevent collisions and interference [2,3]. This includes time-division ISAC, frequency-division ISAC, and space-division ISAC [2,3]. While orthogonal approaches simplify interference avoidance, they may not fully exploit the potential for spectral efficiency that ISAC promises [11]. In contrast, multiplexing resource allocation allows communication and sensing tasks to share the same time, frequency, or spatial resources [2]. This approach, while potentially more spectrally efficient, introduces significant challenges related to managing inter-system and intra-system interference [2,3]. Multiplexing resource allocation, particularly in multi-base station cooperative systems, often focuses on the intricate allocation of communication and sensing power for each base station–terminal link [2]. Opportunistic spectrum sharing is also considered a method for radar and communication coexistence, allowing flexible use of available spectrum resources [32].  

A fundamental challenge in ISAC is the joint optimization of communication and sensing performance, which often presents conflicting requirements. This involves analyzing the trade-offs in resource utilization, throughput for communication, and sensing metrics (e.g., detection probability, estimation accuracy). Addressing this multi-objective problem typically involves two common methods: optimizing one objective while ensuring the other meets a minimum threshold, or formulating a new objective function that is a weighted sum of both communication and sensing metrics [10]. The weighted sum approach is often expressed as  

$$
f ( R ) = \alpha C ( R ) + \beta S ( R ) ,
$$  

where $C ( R )$ and $S ( R )$ represent communication and sensing metrics respectively, and $\alpha , \beta$ are weights balancing their importance [10]. Alternatively, a constraint-based optimization problem might be formulated to maximize a sensing performance metric subject to a minimum communication performance threshold, e.g.,  

$$
\operatorname* { m a x } _ { R } S ( R ) \quad { \mathrm { s . t . } } \quad C ( R ) \geq C _ { t h }
$$  

[10]. Jointly optimizing these objectives, especially in dynamic environments with varying channel conditions, target characteristics, and traffic demands, poses considerable complexity.  

Power allocation plays a critical role in managing the trade-off between communication and sensing performance, particularly in multiplexing schemes [2]. The distribution of power between the two functions directly impacts communication throughput and reliability on one hand, and sensing range, accuracy, and interference generation on the other. Optimal power allocation strategies aim to dynamically balance these competing needs based on the current system state and performance requirements. Resource allocation strategies also encompass higher-level decisions, such as those required for multi-target tracking in multiple radar systems [28].  

Effective interference management is crucial for enabling spectral cohabitation and ensuring system performance [12,15]. Interference in ISAC systems includes communication–sensing signal mutual interference, non-target clutter interference, and cross-link interference [2,3]. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate these interference types [2]. Interference cancellation techniques are necessary, especially in scenarios where separate radar and communication systems share the same spectrum [12]. Specific approaches include Null-Space Projection (NSP) precoding, used in communications–radar spectrum sharing to nullify interference towards communication receivers or radar systems [32]. Spatial spectrum nulling can also be employed, for example, in wideband OFDM-DFRC systems with hybrid beamforming [28]. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) offer another avenue for interference management, potentially configured to differentiate targets using unique angles or generate distinct radio maps to mitigate inter-target interference [10]. Furthermore, some advanced techniques, such as symbol-level precoding (SLP), explore the possibility of treating interference not merely as a detrimental effect but as a potentially useful resource in multi-access communication systems [21]. Jointly designing parameters like precoding matrices and RIS configurations can further enhance interference mitigation and optimize overall system performance, such as maximizing sum rates in MIMO interference networks [26].  

# 4.4 Channel Estimation and Modeling  

Accurate channel state information (CSI) is paramount for effective system design and performance optimization in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, particularly as operations extend to challenging propagation environments such as millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-Terahertz (sub-THz) bands [22]. Traditional channel models, often relying on simplified statistical or deterministic representations, face significant limitations in capturing the dynamic, complex, and environment-dependent nature of ISAC channels [8]. The intricate interplay between sensing and communication functionalities, coupled with dynamic environments and large antenna arrays in technologies like massive MIMO, necessitates novel approaches for channel estimation and modeling that can leverage sensing information to enhance accuracy and efficiency [7].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Approach</td><td>Description</td><td>Sensing Data Used</td><td>Technique Examples</td><td>Benefit</td></tr><tr><td>Radar-Assisted Communicatio n CE</td><td>Radar functionality provides prior info for communication channel estimation.</td><td>Target angle information</td><td>Deep Unfolding Networks (P- LISTA).</td><td>Improved accuracy/efficie ncy.</td></tr><tr><td>Integrated Waveform CE</td><td>Waveforms designed to support both sensing and CE.</td><td>Radar/Communi cation separation info</td><td>OFDM-IM based 2D- periodogram.</td><td>Inherent CE capability.</td></tr><tr><td>RCSS Interference Channel Estimation</td><td>Communication receiver estimates radar interference</td><td>Radar sensing signals</td><td>Novel techniques.</td><td>Bypasses information exchange.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>channel directly.</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

A key paradigm shift in ISAC channel estimation is the utilization of sensing data as valuable prior information. By incorporating environmental insights obtained through sensing, ISAC systems can potentially overcome the limitations of purely communication-driven channel estimation techniques. For instance, knowledge about the location and characteristics of scattering objects, obtained via sensing, can inform sparse channel recovery algorithms or aid in predicting channel variations [7,26]. This approach is particularly relevant in mmWave systems, where channels often exhibit sparsity in the angular domain due to severe path loss limiting the number of significant multi-paths [7].  

Methods leveraging radar sensing to assist communication channel estimation have garnered significant attention [7]. One proposed approach for mmWave massive MIMO systems employs a deep unfolding neural network that exploits the angular sparsity of the channel [7]. In this method, radar functionality is used to obtain target angle information, which is then transmitted to the communication module [7]. This angle information serves as prior knowledge, allowing the communication module to transform channel estimation into a sparse signal recovery problem, thereby improving estimation accuracy [7]. Beyond dedicated radar assistance, integrated waveforms like OFDM-IM can inherently support channel estimation by leveraging their radar capabilities [25]. A novel scheme for OFDM-IM estimates the channel by first identifying null subcarrier locations related to radar/communication separation, followed by 2D-periodogram estimation for delay and Doppler shifts and complex attenuation factor estimation based on radar subcarrier locations [25]. Furthermore, in radar-communication spectrum sharing (RCSS) scenarios, novel techniques enable the communication end to directly receive radar sensing signals for the estimation of radar-communication interference channels, bypassing traditional information exchange protocols [12].  

The dynamic and complex nature of future wireless environments necessitates sophisticated channel modeling techniques that go beyond static representations. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain, leading to concepts like AI-Powered Channel Measurement and Modeling (iCHAMM) [18]. ML methods can be employed for nonlinear channel modeling and prediction, particularly in mobile scenarios, to achieve accurate representations under varying conditions [26]. Advanced techniques like variational autoencoders (VAEs) are being explored to project radar signals into low-dimensional latent spaces, generalizing the concept of "channel charting" to complex scenarios involving extended targets, thereby offering novel pathways for channel representation and modeling [13].​  

Environment reconstruction based on high-precision sensing facilitated by ISAC technology offers a promising avenue for enhancing channel knowledge [8]. By accurately reconstructing the environment, including the locations and properties of scatterers, the communication system can gain crucial insights that directly aid in channel reconstruction [8]. This perceptual environmental information can then be used to improve tasks such as beam alignment and reduce link failures, ultimately decreasing communication overhead [8]. Existing techniques for environment reconstruction, such as using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to handle limited electromagnetic perception datasets and annotation challenges, have demonstrated effectiveness in improving reconstruction accuracy [8].​  

Despite these advancements, critical evaluation of existing environment reconstruction techniques highlights several challenges. The accuracy of reconstruction is highly dependent on sensor density, data quality, and processing capabilities. Real-time reconstruction in rapidly changing environments remains a significant hurdle. Furthermore, effectively translating complex environmental maps into actionable channel state information or channel model parameters requires further research. Future research directions in environment reconstruction for channel modeling should focus on developing robust, real-time reconstruction algorithms applicable to diverse environments, investigating methods for fusing data from heterogeneous sensing modalities, and establishing rigorous frameworks for quantifying the impact of reconstruction errors on channel estimation and communication performance [8]. Exploring the use of large models for channel estimation problems, as identified in recent discussions, also represents a potential area for future work, addressing the need for sophisticated models to handle complex channel dynamics [26].​

The evolution towards 5G-Advanced (5G-A) and 6G is leveraging emerging technologies to enhance Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) capabilities, particularly focusing on higher frequency bands and advanced signal manipulation techniques. Millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) frequencies are identified as crucial spectrum resources for future wireless systems, offering the potential for significantly higher data rates due to larger available bandwidths and enabling high-resolution sensing due to shorter wavelengths [9,22]. Specifically, the sub-THz band (90-300 GHz) is under active development for 6G [22].  

Research and industry efforts are exploring the application of mmWave and THz technologies for ISAC. For instance, mmWave communication is being studied for waveform design in joint communication and radar systems, often within the 5G mmWave bands [25], and research is focused on channel estimation techniques for mmWave communication, including methods based on deep unfolding neural networks [7]. The proximity of 5G mmWave communication bands to the operating frequencies of vehicle-mounted millimeter-wave radar highlights the potential for spectrum sharing and integration [12]. Furthermore, commercial applications are beginning to emerge, such as Wi-Fi 7 devices operating in the mmWave spectrum with high-gain antennas to achieve substantial peak rates over several kilometers [23]. Dedicated research on millimeter-wave antenna designs and channel measurements is also crucial for realizing the potential of these frequencies [18].​  

THz technology is also being actively prototyped for ISAC applications. A notable prototype operates in the 100-300 GHz range, demonstrating outdoor communication at 220 GHz with 13.5 GHz bandwidth and indoor sensing at 140 GHz with 8 GHz bandwidth, showcasing the potential for both high-speed communication and precise sensing [9]. Despite the significant potential, realizing ISAC at mmWave and THz frequencies faces challenges related to signal propagation, including high path loss and atmospheric absorption, as well as complexities in hardware implementation. These challenges necessitate extensive research on channel modeling, hardware impairments, and efficient beamforming techniques tailored for ISAC systems operating in these bands [27].​  

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) represent another pivotal technology poised to significantly impact ISAC systems in 6G networks [10,27]. RIS can intelligently reconfigure the wireless propagation environment by controlling the reflection, refraction, or scattering of incident electromagnetic waves. This capability holds the potential to improve the coverage, increase the capacity, and enhance the energy efficiency of ISAC systems [10,27]. By optimizing the signal paths, RIS can mitigate shadowing effects, enhance signal strength, and enable more efficient resource allocation for both communication and sensing tasks. For instance, the deployment of RIS has been shown to enhance the radar's ability to localize multiple targets [11].​  

However, the integration and deployment of RIS in ISAC systems present their own set of challenges. These include the formulation and solution of sophisticated optimization problems for configuring the RIS elements, particularly when dealing with dynamic environments or an unknown number of targets [10,11]. Research is ongoing to address these issues, exploring advanced RIS designs such as Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces and sub-block level RIS optimization schemes to better serve dual-function radar-communication objectives [28]. Prototyping, testing, and standardization efforts are actively underway to facilitate the practical implementation of RIS in future networks [27].  

Collectively, mmWave, THz, and RIS technologies are fundamental enablers being explored to fulfill the ambitious performance requirements of ISAC in the 5G-A and 6G era [27].  

# 5. AI and Machine Learning for ISAC

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are poised to play a fundamental and transformative role in the development and enhancement of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, particularly as they evolve towards 5G-Advanced and 6G [16,22,23,27]. Leveraging vast amounts of data collected from wireless networks, AI/ML can address complex and often unstructured problems inherent in converging sensing and communication functionalities [5]. Their capabilities extend across multiple facets of ISAC systems, including signal processing, resource allocation, environment awareness, and overall network optimization [7,16,22,33].  

In the realm of signal processing, AI/ML offers sophisticated solutions for tasks critical to both sensing and communication performance. Channel estimation, a prime example, benefits significantly from AI/ML approaches. Techniques such as deep unfolding networks, like the P-LISTA method, are being investigated to improve estimation efficiency and accuracy by incorporating prior sensing information [7]. Data-driven methods, including variational autoencoders (VAE), are also employed for processing complex signals like radar data, projecting them into low-dimensional latent spaces for more effective analysis [13]. Beyond channel estimation, AI/ML is applied to processing sensed data itself, enabling applications like health monitoring through optical sensing data analysis [19]. The application of AI/ML extends to other signal processing areas such as signal detection and potentially interference mitigation, with the potential to offer performance advantages over traditional methods [5,6]. Furthermore, AI-powered technologies are being explored for optimizing waveform design, a complex problem requiring simultaneous consideration of communication and sensing requirements [18]. AI/ML-based channel state information (CSI) feedback mechanisms are also gaining traction and are being considered for standardization in advanced cellular releases [27].​  

AI/ML techniques are also crucial for optimizing resource allocation in ISAC systems. While specific details on spectrum and power allocation optimization using AI/ML in the provided materials are limited, the general principle is to enhance joint sensing and communication performance by intelligently managing system resources, potentially surpassing the capabilities of traditional methods.  

Network-level optimization within ISAC systems represents another key application area for AI/ML. This includes autonomous and rapid network control, predictive resource optimization, energy conservation, load balancing, and mobility management [5,22]. AI is also being integrated into digital twin network frameworks to enhance overall network management and performance [27]. Network functions are leveraging AI-driven analytics to support decision-making processes [5]. Sensing data generated by the ISAC network itself serves as a valuable big data source for training and learning within AI systems, facilitating tasks like high-precision environment reconstruction which can then inform communication channel reconstruction [8,9].​  

Specific AI/ML techniques such as deep learning, machine learning, deep unfolding networks, and variational autoencoders are fundamental to these applications [7,13,33]. The training methodologies, such as staged learning rate approaches for deep networks, are critical for achieving effective performance in complex ISAC scenarios [7].​  

The integration of AI/ML into ISAC presents significant opportunities for enhancing performance and enabling new capabilities, but it also comes with challenges. These include computational complexity, the need for robust models capable of handling imperfect or noisy sensing data, and ensuring the reliable performance of AI algorithms in real-time wireless environments [6,33]. The research community is actively exploring these areas, including applications of ML in wireless sensing and communication, as highlighted by relevant conference topics [6]. Overall, AI/ML is considered essential for tackling the complex demands of ISAC systems in future wireless generations [16].  

# 5.1 AI for Signal Processing  

The integration of sensing and communication functionalities within a unified system architecture necessitates advanced signal processing techniques to effectively manage and interpret the complex data streams generated. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms have emerged as powerful tools to address various signal processing challenges in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, offering potential performance improvements over traditional methods [5,6]. AI/ML can be applied across diverse tasks, including channel estimation, signal detection, and potentially interference mitigation, leveraging their capability to learn complex patterns and relationships within data [6,18].

One significant application area is channel estimation, crucial for both reliable communication and accurate sensing. Traditional channel estimation methods can face challenges in complex ISAC environments. AI/ML techniques, such as deep unfolding networks, are being explored to improve efficiency and performance. For instance, a P-LISTA algorithm, a deep unfolded network approach, has been proposed for sparse channel estimation in ISAC scenarios [7]. This method uniquely integrates radar-obtained target angle information as prior knowledge to enhance the channel estimation process within the communication module, designing a new soft threshold shrinkage function specifically tailored to this prior information [7]. This demonstrates how ISAC can create synergy, where sensing data informs communication-specific signal processing.  

Beyond channel estimation, AI/ML is also applied directly to processing sensed data. In ISAC-Optical Wireless (ISAC-OW) systems, AI/ML algorithms are utilized to process sensed data, such as detecting subtle changes in facial light intensity for applications like health monitoring [19]. For radar signal processing within ISAC, advanced techniques like variational autoencoders (VAE) are employed [13]. VAEs project radar signals onto a low-dimensional latent space, which is considered a form of advanced signal processing, enabling efficient representation and analysis of complex radar data [13].  

The potential performance advantages of AI/ML-based signal processing over traditional approaches are being investigated, particularly for improving air interface performance in ISAC systems [5]. AI/ML techniques are explored for tasks like beam management and channel state information feedback, with the potential to outperform conventional methods [5]. The goal is often a unified AI/ML framework for the air interface, involving collaborative intelligence between the gNB and User Equipment (UE) to extract relevant features for model training and inference [5].​  

While AI/ML offers significant promise, implementing these techniques in ISAC systems comes with computational complexity and implementation challenges. Although the provided digests do not detail specific computational costs or direct comparisons of complexity, AI/ML models, especially deep learning architectures, typically require substantial computational resources for training and inference. This necessitates careful consideration of hardware capabilities and potential optimization techniques for real-time processing in resource-constrained wireless devices and network nodes. Furthermore, the accuracy of perception data itself can impact downstream signal processing tasks. For example, the accuracy of electromagnetic perception data is significantly affected by factors such as beam width, distance, and the incident angle with the environmental plane [8]. While the digest does not explicitly link this to AI signal processing, such inherent inaccuracies in sensing data present a challenge that AI-driven fusion techniques would need to address to ensure reliable signal processing outcomes [8]. Developing robust AI models that can handle imperfect or noisy ISAC data remains an ongoing research challenge.​  

# 5.2 AI for Resource Management  

The aim of this subsection is to explore the application of AI/ML techniques for optimizing resource allocation—specifically, spectrum and power—in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Such optimization is expected to enhance both sensing and communication performance, potentially outperforming traditional resource management methods. In a typical scenario, multiple consecutive references would be formatted as, for example,  to attribute source material supporting the discussion.  

However, since no individual paper digests were provided, it is not possible to extract, analyze, compare, and synthesize the detailed content necessary for a comprehensive treatment of the subject. Additionally, any mathematical expressions or formulas introduced in the discussion would need to conform to KaTeX standards. This implies that:  

• All expressions should have correct syntax and balanced parentheses.   
• Any macros or commands from other macro packages must be replaced with equivalent KaTeX-supported expressions.  

Without specific formulas or additional source content, further refinement or conversion of mathematical expressions cannot be demonstrated at this time.  

# 5.3 AI for Network Optimization  

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is being actively explored to enhance network-level optimization within the context of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. This exploration encompasses various facets of network management. A notable area of investigation is the application of AI for network-level optimization in the framework of digital twin networks [27]. Such approaches aim to leverage AI capabilities to improve network performance, although the specific mechanisms and detailed applications across network planning, traffic management, and mobility management, as well as associated implementation challenges, are subjects of ongoing research and further analysis.​  

# 5.4 Specific AI/ML Applications (e.g., Channel Estimation, Waveform Design)  

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques is becoming increasingly vital for addressing complex challenges in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, particularly in tasks such as channel estimation and waveform design. AI/ML-based approaches are being explored to enhance performance and efficiency in these critical areas.  

Deep learning has emerged as a prominent technique for channel estimation in ISAC systems, offering potential improvements over traditional methods. One specific approach involves the use of deep unfolded networks, such as the 12- layer P-LISTA network, for channel estimation [7]. The training methodology for such networks often employs a staged learning rate approach. For instance, an initial learning rate of 0.001 can be used, which is then progressively reduced by preset ratios (e.g., 0.5, 0.1, and 0.01) when the loss function fails to decrease after a specified number of iterations, such as 200 [7]. This staged reduction helps fine-tune the network parameters effectively.  

Another application of AI/ML in channel estimation within the ISAC context utilizes variational autoencoders (VAE) [13]. VAEs can be employed to project complex radar signals onto a low-dimensional latent space, facilitating more efficient processing and estimation of channel characteristics [13].​  

Furthermore, AI/ML-based Channel State Information (CSI) feedback mechanisms are being actively developed and considered for inclusion in communication standards, such as 5G-Advanced Release 18 and 19 [27], highlighting the growing recognition of AI's role in channel state management. While these examples demonstrate the application of diverse network architectures and training strategies, the explicit advantages and limitations of these deep learning-based channel estimation methods in ISAC, such as their performance gains, computational complexity, and generalization capabilities under varying channel conditions, require further detailed analysis based on specific research findings.  

Beyond channel estimation, $A l / M L$ is also being investigated for optimizing waveform design in ISAC systems. This is considered a complex problem where AI-powered technologies can potentially yield significant benefits [18]. However, specific details on how AI/ML techniques are being applied for waveform optimization, the particular benefits achieved, and the associated challenges in this context are not extensively elaborated upon in the provided materials. Research in this area aims to design waveforms that simultaneously satisfy the requirements for both reliable communication and accurate sensing, potentially leveraging AI to navigate the complex trade-offs involved.  

# 6. Applications and Use Cases

Despite promising demonstrations, challenges remain in the widespread implementation of ISAC. These include the need for more extensive field trials and experimental results to quantitatively assess performance in diverse and nonideal realworld conditions [6,34]. Integrating ISAC into existing or future network infrastructures presents complexities. Furthermore, specific challenges and opportunities arise in implementing ISAC for each unique application domain, requiring tailored solutions and potentially AI-powered approaches [2,18]. Addressing security and privacy considerations within ISAC systems is also critical for their successful deployment across sensitive applications [31].​  

# 6.1 Application Domains and Specific Use Cases  

Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is poised to facilitate a wide array of new applications and services within the 5G-Advanced (5G-A) and 6G frameworks that inherently require sophisticated sensing capabilities [14]. These frameworks, particularly IMT-2030, aim to deliver wide-area multi-dimensional sensing, providing crucial spatial information about both unconnected objects and connected devices, as well as details regarding their movements and surroundings [14]. This foundational capability enables ISAC to play a pivotal role across diverse sectors.

Furthermore, it facilitates the development of wireless communication systems tailored for ultra-high-speed trains, providing reliable and high-speed connectivity for operational needs and passenger services [34]. The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for collecting sensing data from railway infrastructure and offloading computational tasks represents another key application, enhancing data acquisition and processing for maintenance and monitoring [34]. These railway applications underscore the demand for reliable, lowlatency communication and sensing to uphold safety and operational efficiency, often leveraging AI for dynamic resource allocation and optimization [34].  

In vehicular contexts, ISAC is directly relevant through the integration of vehicle-mounted millimeter-wave radar and vehicular communication, laying the groundwork for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving by enabling critical tasks like object detection, localization, and tracking [12,14]. The broader concept of smart mobility within smart cities also benefits from ISAC capabilities [21].​  

Healthcare is another domain leveraging ISAC, specifically for applications such as contactless patient monitoring and general health and elder care [19,31]. These applications necessitate sensing and communication with requirements for high accuracy, low latency, and often EMF-free operation [19].  

In the industrial sector, ISAC is enabling advancements in industrial automation, including remote robot control and monitoring [19]. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a key beneficiary, where ISAC supports process monitoring and collaborative robotic tasks by providing essential sensing and communication capabilities [27].  

Urban and environmental applications also benefit from ISAC. This includes smart cities infrastructure support, urban security, monitoring of critical infrastructure, and environmental monitoring [21,31]. ISAC contributes to creating fieldassigned radio maps and facilitating remote sensing tasks in these environments [31].  

Beyond these specific domains, ISAC enables general sensing-dependent tasks and applications such as Extended Reality (XR), spatial sensing for visual positioning, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and multi-functional networks [27,31]. These applications commonly require high precision and resolution sensing coupled with ultra-low latency, high reliability, and ultra-high-speed communication [4].  

Implementing ISAC in diverse and potentially harsh environments, such as automotive, industrial, urban, and railway settings, presents inherent challenges. These environments often demand solutions capable of high reliability and robustness to environmental factors. Furthermore, while the potential use cases are significant, a documented challenge in current research is the lack of specific performance metrics and comprehensive experimental results to quantitatively assess the practical effectiveness and limitations of proposed ISAC solutions, highlighting a need for further focus on simulation and real-world testing [34]. Other related aspects explored in the context of 5G-A and 6G deployment include enhanced mobile AI supporting application performance, high-speed Fixed Wireless Access (FWA), lightweight IoT applications via technologies like RedCap, and the development of low-altitude communication networks [23]. The intersection of ISAC with security and privacy considerations is also a critical area [31].​

Available information highlights several significant prototype demonstrations showcasing the potential of ISAC across different frequency bands and application scenarios, providing insights into current capabilities and deployment challenges.  

The Huawei 6G Research Team has developed prototypes demonstrating ISAC capabilities in both the terahertz (THz) and optical wireless (OW) bands [9,19]. Their ISAC-THz unified platform, operating in the 100–300 GHz range, has been verified through prototype demonstrations in challenging scenarios, including high-precision sensing/imaging and outdoor ultrahigh-speed transmission [9]. The THz communication prototype achieved an impressive 240 Gbps outdoor transmission over a 500-m line-of-sight link, showcasing the potential for extremely high data rates required by future networks [9]. Concurrently, the ISAC-THz sensing prototype demonstrated millimeter-level imaging resolution for objects within a closed environment, indicating high precision relevant for applications like industrial automation or security [9]. Separately, the ISAC-OW prototype from Huawei demonstrates the integration of communication, positioning, and sensing in a simulated medical environment, achieving centimeter-level indoor localization accuracy and contactless monitoring of vital signs like heartbeat and breathing with precision comparable to commercial wearable devices [19]. These demonstrations validate the technical feasibility of integrating sensing and communication functionalities across distinct parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and for diverse application requirements.  

Beyond high-frequency bands, demonstrations have also explored ISAC capabilities at lower frequencies relevant for current and near-future deployments. A demonstration using two 10 GHz base stations in an outdoor street scenario employed self-transmitting and self-receiving via beam scanning for environment reconstruction [8]. By comparing the reconstructed environment with the actual setting and analyzing channel data measured in both real and reconstructed environments, the effectiveness of the environment reconstruction algorithm and the feasibility of utilizing perception data for communication assistance were validated [8]. The results indicated accurate reconstruction of typical street scenes, highlighting the potential for ISAC to improve communication performance in complex urban environments by leveraging environmental context [8].​  

Furthermore, industry players like vivo have unveiled ISAC prototypes based on different sensing modes, including Base Station (BS) monostatic sensing, BS-to-User Equipment (UE) bistatic sensing, and Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) based sensing [16]. These diverse approaches explored in prototyping reflect ongoing efforts to determine optimal ISAC architectures for various deployment scenarios and sensing requirements. High-level demonstrations also encompass various relevant technologies such as Extended Reality (XR), FR3 frequencies, and THz bands, hinting at the broad scope of ISAC applications being explored [27].  

The performance results demonstrated, such as multi-Gbps communication speeds in THz, centimeter-level localization, and millimeter-level imaging, indicate that ISAC has the potential to meet stringent performance demands envisioned for 5G-Advanced and 6G systems [9,19]. Insights gained from these prototypes and demonstrations highlight the technical feasibility across different frequency bands and architectural designs [8,9,16,19]. While specific details on performance under widely varying non-ideal conditions or integration challenges are often limited in current digests, the verification in "challenging scenarios" for THz ISAC and handling of "typical street scenes" for 10 GHz environment reconstruction suggest initial steps towards evaluating performance in realistic, non-ideal environments [8,9]. The stated interest in "Field trials and experimental results of integrated systems" within academic conferences underscores the research community's recognition of the need for further real-world validation and exploration of integration challenges [6]. Despite promising prototype results, the transition from laboratory demonstrations to widespread deployment necessitates more extensive field trials to thoroughly evaluate performance under diverse and non-ideal conditions and to address potential integration complexities within existing or future network infrastructures. Some areas still require further research to validate patented technologies through practical demonstrations [34].  

# 7. Standardization Efforts  

The successful realization and widespread adoption of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) within the next generations of mobile networks, namely 5G-Advanced (5G-A) and 6G, are critically dependent on comprehensive standardization efforts by key global bodies.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Body</td><td>Role /Focus</td><td>Relevance to ISAC</td></tr><tr><td>International Telecommunication Union (ITU)</td><td>Global framework for ICT, Spectrum management (ITU- R), IMT-2030 definition (WP 5D).</td><td>Defines overall goals and usage scenarios (ISAC is a major one for IMT-2030).</td></tr><tr><td>Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)</td><td>Develops technical specifications and standards for cellular networks (5G, 5G- A, 6G).</td><td>Developing detailed standards incorporating ISAC features (Rel 18/19, 6G Rel 21+).</td></tr><tr><td>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</td><td>Develops foundational communication and networking standards (e.g., Wi-Fi).</td><td>Provides building blocks and related standards potentially used in ISAC systems.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The standardization process for 6G, known as International Mobile Telecommunications for 2030 and beyond (IMT-2030), is spearheaded by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) [14]. The ITU, particularly its Radiocommunication sector (ITU-R) and Working Party (WP) 5D, is responsible for establishing the overarching framework and defining the overall goals for IMT-2030 [14], finalizing the "Framework and Overall Goal Recommendation for IMT for 2030 and Future Development" in June 2023 [2,3,17]. Within this framework, ISAC has been explicitly identified as one of the six major usage scenarios for IMT-2030, supporting diverse applications such as auxiliary navigation, motion tracking, and environmental monitoring [2,3,17]. Complementary to the ITU's framework role, 3GPP is tasked with developing the detailed technical specifications and standards for 5G, 5G-A, and 6G [5,14]. Global 6G standardization is actively underway, with the timeline for finalizing IMT-2030 radio interface technology standards targeted for June 2030 [14]. The IEEE also contributes to relevant foundational communication standards, such as IEEE 802.11aj [18], which may provide building blocks for ISAC technologies.  

Relevant standardization efforts and industry activities related to ISAC in 5G-A and 6G are progressing across various fronts 3GPP Release 18 and Release 19 are key enablers for 5G-A development, incorporating discussions on areas potentially relevant to ISAC, such as AI/ML-based Channel State Information (CSI) feedback and the integration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) [23,27]. 6G standardization is anticipated to formally commence from Release 21 [5]. Industry initiatives, such as the release of white papers on new network service models like the "Intelligent Body Communication Network (ACN)" [23], further highlight ongoing efforts to define the scope and architecture for future networks that may incorporate ISAC capabilities. IMT-2020 Promotion Group has also conducted research on 5G-Advanced communicationsensing integrated network architecture, covering interfaces, protocols, functions, and end-to-end processes [2]. Furthermore, the IMT-2030 (6G) Promotion Group's research has delved deeper into ISAC technology, proposing core characteristics such as multi-element sharing, multi-frequency band collaboration, and multi-node collaboration [2,3], providing technical directions for areas like multi-base station cooperative ISAC. While specific details on ISAC integration methods within certain standard proposals, such as IMT-2020 for high-speed rail 5G networks [34], may not be extensively elaborated in the available digests, the general trend indicates a strong focus on incorporating ISAC as a fundamental capability of 6G [17,27].​  

ISAC is being integrated into 5G-Advanced and 6G standards by defining its role as a fundamental feature, particularly in 6G, aiming to evolve the network into a unified entity of connection, sensing, and intelligence [17]. The integration involves considering specific features and functionalities like AI/ML and RIS for optimizing ISAC performance [27], as well as architectural characteristics such as multi-element sharing, multi-frequency band collaboration, and multi-node collaboration [2,3]. These efforts lay the groundwork for enabling advanced applications that require coexisting highperformance communication and precise environmental sensing [23].​  

The standardization of ISAC for future mobile networks presents several challenges. A primary challenge in general standardization is achieving consensus among numerous member countries with diverse interests [14]. For ISAC specifically, challenges include defining common metrics for evaluating joint communication and sensing performance, establishing resource allocation mechanisms that efficiently balance both functions, and ensuring interoperability across different implementations and scenarios.  

A significant dimension of standardization for 5G-A and 6G involves satellite-based mobile communication networks, known as Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN). 3GPP and ITU-T have been actively standardizing NTN integration, including defining network architectures (e.g., transparent and regenerative satellite architectures) and addressing the impacts of satellite links (inter-satellite links and feeder links) on network signaling and performance [1]. ITU-T's work on Fixed-Satellite Mobile Communication (FMSC) and the Y.3201 recommendation contributes to the architectural framework for star-based fusion networks [1]. Standardizing interface protocols for NTN regenerative architectures and mobility management techniques for complex satellite scenarios are crucial efforts underway [1]. Challenges in standardizing ISAC for satellite communications are compounded by the unique characteristics of NTN, such as long propagation delays, significant Doppler shifts, intermittent connectivity, and complex mobility management requirements. Adapting ISAC protocols, data formats, and resource management for the space–air–ground integrated network environment requires dedicated standardization efforts building upon the foundational NTN standards.​  

The potential impact of standardization on the adoption and deployment of ISAC is substantial [27]. Clear and comprehensive standards ensure interoperability between different vendors and network components, fostering a competitive market and reducing deployment risks. Standardization provides a common reference for researchers and developers, accelerating innovation and leading to more robust and efficient ISAC solutions. Without timely and welldefined standards, the fragmentation of proprietary solutions could hinder the widespread adoption and full potential realization of ISAC in 5G-A and 6G networks.  

# 7.1 Global Standardization Bodies and Process  

The evolution of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) capabilities within the frameworks of 5G-Advanced (5G-A) and 6G necessitates the involvement and guidance of global standardization bodies. These organizations play a crucial role in defining the technical specifications, ensuring interoperability, and facilitating the widespread adoption of novel technologies like ISAC. Key bodies driving this process include the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).​  

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) serves as a pivotal global organization responsible for all matters pertaining to information and communication technologies ([14]). Within the ITU structure, the Radiocommunication sector (ITU-R) holds specific responsibility for radiocommunication aspects ([14]). A notable entity within ITU-R is Working Party (WP) 5D, which is tasked with the overall radio system aspects of International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) systems, including the development framework for IMT-2030 (corresponding to 6G) ([14]).  

Furthermore, both the ITU-T and 3GPP are identified as principal standardization bodies actively engaged in the development of 5G-A and 6G, particularly concerning satellite-based network technologies ([1]). The 3GPP focuses on cellular communication standards, contributing significantly to the technical specifications of 5G-A and the forthcoming 6G systems. Alongside ITU-T, 3GPP is crucial for standardizing aspects like satellite integration into mobile networks—a domain potentially leveraging ISAC for enhanced connectivity and situational awareness ([1]).  

The IEEE, while perhaps more focused on wired and local wireless networking standards, also contributes to foundational communication technologies relevant to ISAC. For instance, proposals related to traffic awareness and congestion control within IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16 highlight IEEE’s role in standardizing specific technical functionalities that could be integral to the communication component of ISAC systems ([34]). While the direct standardization of ISAC as a unified concept by IEEE is not explicitly detailed in the available digests, its work on underlying communication protocols provides essential building blocks.  

The standardization process orchestrated by these bodies involves defining requirements, evaluating candidate technologies, and developing detailed technical specifications. This process is critical for ISAC, as it ensures that integrated sensing and communication functions can interoperate across different vendors’ equipment and network deployments. By establishing common standards, these bodies facilitate the widespread adoption of ISAC technologies, driving research and development toward unified technical goals and promoting a cohesive ecosystem for future wireless systems. Although the specific contours of ISAC standardization within 5G-A and 6G are still evolving, the foundational work and frameworks provided by ITU, 3GPP, and IEEE are indispensable for its successful integration and deployment.​  

# 7.2 ISAC Integration in 5G-A and 6G Standards  

The evolution of mobile communication standards towards 5G-Advanced (5G-A) and 6G is increasingly recognizing the importance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). While the detailed specifications for ISAC integration within the official standards documents are continuously evolving, the concept and its associated features are actively being considered in the development frameworks for these future generations [27]. Specifically, 6G is envisioned to significantly broaden its capabilities and applications by fundamentally integrating sensing functions with traditional communication systems [14].​  

The scope of ISAC integration in these standards encompasses enabling a wide variety of new functionalities and enhancing existing network capabilities. Key technologies being explored for integration into 5G-A and 6G standards to facilitate ISAC include the application of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques and the deployment of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) [27]. These technologies are anticipated to play a crucial role in optimizing the joint operation of sensing and communication functions, managing interference, and enhancing signal processing for both purposes.  

The benefits of incorporating ISAC into 5G-A and 6G standards are substantial. By enabling devices and infrastructure to simultaneously communicate and sense their environment using the same radio resources, ISAC can lead to improved spectral and energy efficiency, reduced hardware complexity, and enhanced network intelligence. Although detailed standard specifications are under development, the potential impact on network capabilities is expected to be profound, unlocking advanced applications that require precise environmental awareness alongside high-performance communication. Examples of such applications highlighted in related discussions include enhanced sensing capabilities crucial for smart cities and advanced industrial automation scenarios [23]. While some standard-related activities, such as  

IMT-2020 proposals for specific scenarios like high-speed rail 5G networks, are underway, explicit details on the method of ISAC integration within these specific proposals were not elaborated upon in the reviewed material [34]. Nevertheless, the overall trend indicates a strong commitment within the standards community to incorporate ISAC as a foundational element for the capabilities of 5G-A and, more significantly, 6G [14,27].  

# 7.3 Satellite-Based ISAC and NTN Standardization  

The integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) into mobile communication standards is a critical area of focus for 5GAdvanced (5G-A) and 6G, aiming to extend network coverage and support diverse applications. Standardization bodies such as 3GPP and ITU have been actively developing frameworks and technical specifications to incorporate satellite-based communication into the global mobile network ecosystem [1]. This standardization effort encompasses various aspects, including the definition of network architectures, interface protocols, and mobility management techniques tailored for satellite links. The emergence of hardware supporting these standards, such as chips with 5G NR NTN capabilities [23], indicates tangible progress in bringing satellite integration to reality. The field continues to evolve, with ongoing research exploring opportunities and challenges in next-generation NTNs and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite technologies [29].

A significant portion of the standardization roadmap for NTN within 3GPP has focused on establishing fundamental technical solutions for seamlessly integrating satellite components [1]. Key features under consideration include regenerative satellite architectures, where processing and routing functions are performed on board the satellite, and storeand-forward mechanisms, which enable delayed transmission in certain scenarios [1]. These architectures introduce specific challenges, particularly concerning interface protocols and mobility management, which differ significantly from terrestrial network paradigms.​  

For NTN regenerative architectures, standardizing interface protocols is crucial to ensure interoperability between the satellite segment and the terrestrial core network [1]. This involves defining how user data and control plane information are exchanged, considering factors like longer propagation delays, Doppler shifts, and potential intermittent connectivity inherent in satellite links. Proposed technical solutions within 3GPP address these unique characteristics to facilitate reliable communication [1].  

Mobility management in NTN, especially with regenerative satellites, presents distinct challenges compared to terrestrial systems [1]. Users may experience rapid changes in satellite visibility and handover requirements as satellites move relative to the ground or as users move between satellite footprints. Standardization efforts are evaluating various technical solutions to handle these complex mobility scenarios, including enhancements to tracking area updates, handover procedures, and idle mode mobility, ensuring continuous service availability as users transition between satellite beams or between terrestrial and satellite networks [1]. These standardized technical solutions for interface protocols and mobility enhancements are foundational for realizing the potential of NTN within 5G-A and 6G networks. While the current focus is on establishing robust communication links, these efforts lay the groundwork for future capabilities, including the potential implementation of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) functionalities over NTN infrastructure, which would necessitate further standardization to define sensing protocols, data formats, and resource management specific to the space-air-ground integrated network environment. Addressing the challenges related to NTN integration, particularly concerning latency, reliability, and seamless handovers, is a prerequisite for effectively deploying advanced services like ISAC in satellite-assisted scenarios.  

# 8. Challenges and Future Research Directions  

![](images/f9c3580f66bb39fa856bd67a6348836d1ae287dc42000871a647aa0d51288ed1.jpg)  

The widespread realization of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems for future wireless networks, including 5G-Advanced and 6G, faces a multitude of significant challenges that necessitate innovative solutions. These challenges span technical, regulatory, and societal domains [11,27].  

Technical challenges are particularly prominent, encompassing hardware limitations and signal processing complexity. Current hardware capabilities, such as the resolution of Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) and Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs), as well as the performance of millimeter-wave phased arrays, constrain ISAC system precision, bandwidth, and directional capabilities [27,28]. Achieving demanding energy efficiency targets like Tb/Joule further ties into hardware and system design [21]. Signal processing complexity is another critical issue. Joint processing of communication and sensing signals requires substantial computing power and high data processing speeds [3,8]. This complexity is amplified by digital modulation schemes [27], data fusion requirements [3], scenarios involving extended targets [13,28], massive MIMO radar, one-bit quantization, and the implementation of coexistence strategies based on optimization [32]. Furthermore, the fundamental trade-off between communication and sensing performance, such as balancing throughput with sensing resolution, remains a core technical hurdle [11,25]. Deployment‐specific issues like satellite link variations also present technical complexities [1]. Computational support and the need for unified performance evaluation indicators are also identified as key technical challenges [2].  

Spectrum management and coexistence present significant challenges. The increasing density of wireless devices and the operation of ISAC systems within traditional radar bands lead to interference issues, necessitating efficient and flexible spectrum sharing strategies [12,32]. Communications‐radar spectrum sharing (CRSS) is explored as a means to enable shared usage [32]. Developing effective coexistence mechanisms, including interference cancellation techniques like null‐ space projection (NSP) precoding, is essential to mitigate interference between different systems and between the sensing and communication components within an ISAC system [12,32].  

Security and privacy considerations are critical due to the convergence of sensing and communication. This integration creates new vulnerabilities and attack surfaces [4,10,20]. Identified attack models include passive eavesdropping, jamming‐assisted eavesdropping, pilot contamination, and impersonation attacks [4]. Broader risks extend to semantic communication security, quantum security, architecture‐level privacy, AI integration security, and secure sensing, among others [20]. Evaluating security performance often involves metrics like the secrecy rate, expressed as:  

$$

$$  

where $R _ { l e g } ( \Phi )$ and $R _ { e a v } ( \Phi )$ are the rates for the legitimate user and eavesdropper, respectively, potentially optimized over system parameters $\Phi$ [10]. Physical layer security (PLS) techniques are particularly relevant, leveraging channel characteristics to secure transmissions and enhance secrecy rates [4,20,28]. The sensing capabilities of ISAC offer unique opportunities for PLS, enabling sensing‐assisted secure communication by utilizing location and channel information of potential eavesdroppers [4]. Furthermore, the pervasive sensing capabilities raise significant ethical concerns regarding data ownership, consent, surveillance, and potential misuse, requiring robust policies and privacy‐aware design [20].  

Regulatory and standardization challenges are crucial for widespread ISAC adoption. Achieving international consensus in bodies like the ITU is a significant hurdle, as procedural impediments can delay the finalization of necessary frameworks [14]. Securing essential spectrum bands, such as those potentially identified for WRC‐27, also requires proactive regulatory efforts [14]. Interoperability and compatibility across diverse ISAC implementations pose further challenges.​  

Addressing these challenges requires pursuing promising future research directions. Novel architectures are crucial, including integrating ISAC into complex structures like space–air–ground networks [1] and exploring RIS‐assisted systems [4,27]. Miniaturization of components and full‐spectrum integration are also key architectural goals [9]. The exploration of new frequency bands, particularly millimeter‐wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) bands (FR3), and even optical wireless $( 1 5 \mathsf { A C } - 0 \mathsf { W } )$ , is vital for increased bandwidth and resolution [9,19,27]. Advanced waveform and protocol design, including generalizing existing schemes [25] and researching globally optimal constant modulus waveforms [32], is essential. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are expected to be transformative, enabling AI‐native interfaces, data‐driven signal processing techniques like VAE [13,27], and enhancing physical layer security [4]. AI/ML can also help address computational complexity challenges [13].​  

Future research will also focus on enabling a wide range of advanced applications across industries and society, including the industrial internet, emergency rescue, XR, mobile computing [1], 3D stereoscopic imaging, THz mass spectrometry [9], holographic hospitals, and advanced industrial automation [19]. The integration of ISAC with other technologies, such as zero‐energy devices for digital twins [5] and advancements in materials science for THz applications [9], underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. Timely standardization efforts across various bodies are also critical for the commercialization timeline [1,14]. Addressing the computational support challenge may involve flexible resource allocation and advanced processing architectures [2]. Overall, overcoming the identified challenges and exploring these promising research directions will be crucial for unlocking the full potential of ISAC and its significant impact on future wireless networks and society.

The integration of sensing and communication functionalities into a single system introduces a unique set of technical challenges that span across hardware design, signal processing, and fundamental system trade-offs. Addressing these challenges is paramount for the successful deployment of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems in future networks like 5G-Advanced and 6G.  

Current hardware limitations pose significant constraints on ISAC performance. Specifically, the capabilities of millimeterwave (mm-wave) phased arrays, which are critical for directional beamforming in both communication and sensing, present implementation challenges [27]. Furthermore, the resolution of Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) and Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) is a limiting factor, impacting the precision and bandwidth achievable by ISAC systems [28]. Overcoming these hardware bottlenecks through advancements in component technology is essential for enhancing the sensing  

resolution, communication data rates, and overall system efficiency. Achieving ambitious energy efficiency targets, such as Tb/Joule, also represents a key network performance indicator that is intrinsically linked to hardware and system-level design [21].  

The inherent complexity of signal processing algorithms in ISAC systems requires high data processing speed and substantial computing power [3]. Digital modulation schemes, while enabling high data rates for communication, add to the complexity of joint communication and sensing signal processing [27]. Processing large volumes of both communication data and sensing information simultaneously necessitates sophisticated algorithms for data fusion and estimation [3]. Challenges are amplified in scenarios involving extended targets [13,28] or massive MIMO radar systems, especially when considering techniques like one-bit quantization. Implementing coexistence strategies, such as those based on convex optimization, introduces additional complexity due to the requirement for systems to exchange signal parameter information and the design overhead of a central control entity [32]. Furthermore, the design of dedicated receiver algorithms and the increased complexity of the transmitter design are notable challenges [25]. In sensing, particularly with dual-base configurations, challenges arise from rich scattering environments, where a large number of multiple reflection paths can introduce pathological equations, leading to shadow spaces and incorrect solutions in environmental reconstruction [8]. Potential methods for reducing this complexity include the use of machine learning techniques, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs), which can help reduce dimensionality and simplify the processing task [13].  

A fundamental challenge in ISAC design lies in managing the inherent trade-offs between communication performance (e.g., throughput, latency) and sensing performance (e.g., accuracy, resolution, coverage). Designing a joint system where both functionalities operate cooperatively without significant performance degradation is a major objective [25]. This requires careful optimization of shared resources, waveform design, and signal processing techniques to balance competing demands. Beyond these core technical aspects, other challenges include designing secure transmission schemes to protect against eavesdropping in integrated networks and addressing deployment-specific complexities, such as managing satellite link variations and ensuring interface continuity in satellite-based ISAC scenarios [1,4]. Overcoming these multifaceted challenges is critical for realizing the full potential of ISAC in empowering future wireless networks.  

# 8.2 Spectrum Management and Coexistence  

Efficient spectrum utilization is a critical challenge for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, particularly as the development of wireless communication technologies leads to increasing interference within traditional radar bands [12]. Future communication systems, including those incorporating ISAC, must effectively coexist with other electronic devices operating in the same frequency bands [12]. This necessitates the development and implementation of efficient and flexible spectrum sharing strategies to optimize the use of limited spectrum resources [32].​  

Communications-radar spectrum sharing (CRSS) is recognized as an efficient approach to facilitate this shared usage [32]. Within the scope of spectrum sharing techniques for ISAC, various methods are being explored. Opportunistic spectrum sharing, for instance, allows ISAC systems to dynamically access spectrum resources based on availability [32]. Another critical aspect is the development of effective coexistence mechanisms to mitigate interference between ISAC systems and other systems sharing the spectrum, or even within the ISAC system itself between sensing and communication functionalities. Efficient interference cancellation and management techniques are paramount to ensuring mutual noninterference in radar-communication coexistence (RCC) scenarios [12]. Techniques such as null-space projection (NSP) precoding can be employed as a mechanism to manage interference, for example, by directing nulls towards sensitive receivers to minimize disruption [32]. These techniques, including opportunistic sharing, NSP precoding, and general interference cancellation/management, represent different approaches to achieving effective spectrum utilization and coexistence, each with potentially varying performance characteristics and implementation complexities which require careful consideration.​  

# 8.3 Security and Privacy Considerations  

The integration of sensing and communication functionalities in ISAC systems introduces novel security and privacy challenges that necessitate careful consideration [4]. This convergence creates new attack surfaces and vectors not typically present in isolated systems. For instance, in dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems, the sharing of resources such as waveforms, beamformers, and spectrum can inadvertently lead to security threats, including the risk of information leakage to unauthorized entities [10].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Category</td><td>Risks/Attack Models</td><td>Mitigation Approaches/Considerations</td></tr><tr><td>Attacks</td><td>Passive Eavesdropping, Jamming-assisted Eavesdropping, Pilot Contamination, Impersonation Attacks.</td><td>Physical Layer Security (PLS), Sensing-assisted PLS, Distributed Al systems, Unified lifecycle</td></tr><tr><td>Broader Risks</td><td>Semantic Communication Security, Quantum Security, Architecture-level Privacy, Al Integration Security, Secure Sensing, Lightweight Cryptography,Wireless Virtualization/Slicing Security, Authentication/Authorization /Accounting, Secure D2D, Intrusion Detection/Prevention, Secure Data Storage/Computing, Energy-</td><td>Security-by-Design approach, Robust policies, Privacy-aware system design, Utilizing physical properties (e.g., THz penetration).</td></tr><tr><td>Metrics</td><td>efficient Security, Trust Models.

Specific security attack models identified in ISAC networks highlight these emergent vulnerabilities [4]. Passive eavesdropping remains a fundamental concern, where an attacker attempts to intercept information without disrupting legitimate transmissions [4]. More sophisticated attacks leverage the integrated nature of ISAC. Jamming-assisted eavesdropping involves an eavesdropper transmitting interference signals to degrade the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the legitimate receiver, potentially facilitating information capture [4]. Pilot contamination attacks, where an eavesdropper transmits pilot signals identical to those of legitimate users, can disrupt channel state information (CSI) estimation at the transmitter, compromising system performance and security [4]. Furthermore, the complexity of ISAC networks increases vulnerability to impersonation attacks, where malicious nodes masquerade as legitimate participants to interact with the ISAC base station [4].​  

The potential security and privacy risks extend across various layers and aspects of ISAC systems [20]. These include risks related to semantic communications security, quantum communications security, architecture-level security and privacy, security for new service delivery models, and security challenges in integrating AI and Machine Learning into 6G systems [20]. Additional concerns encompass lightweight cryptography for IoT/CPS, wireless virtualization and slicing security, authentication, authorization, and accounting mechanisms, secure D2D communications, intrusion detection/prevention, secure data storage and computing, energy-efficient security for IoT/CPS, and trust models [20]. Secure sensing techniques are also crucial, given the sensitive nature of collected data [20].  

Mitigating these risks requires a multi-faceted approach, employing various security and privacy-preserving techniques. One key metric for evaluating security performance against eavesdropping is the secrecy rate, defined as the achievable rate difference between the legitimate link and the eavesdropping link, expressed as  

$$
R _ { s } = \operatorname* { m a x } ( 0 , R _ { l e g } ( \Phi ) - R _ { e a v } ( \Phi ) )
$$  

where $\backslash ( { \mathsf { R } } _ { - } \{ \mathsf { l e g } \} ( \backslash { \mathsf { P h i } } ) \backslash )$ and $\backslash ( { \mathsf { R \_ } } \{ { \mathsf { e a v } } \} ( \backslash { \mathsf { P h i } } ) \backslash )$ are the rates for the legitimate user and eavesdropper, respectively, potentially optimized over system parameters \(\Phi\) [10]. Architectural design principles can also enhance security and privacy; for example, a distributed AI system design has been proposed as key to ensuring data privacy and security in 6G [16]. Unified lifecycle management based on logical nodes can establish a robust protocol architecture foundational for future-proof security [16]. Furthermore, certain physical layer characteristics, such as the penetration capabilities of THz waves, can offer inherent privacy protection compared to traditional optical imaging, enabling sensing in obscured conditions without revealing sensitive visual details [9]. Research into techniques like lightweight cryptography, secure device-to-device communications, and intrusion detection are vital components of the mitigation strategy [20].  

Physical layer security (PLS) techniques are particularly relevant in the context of ISAC, leveraging the physical characteristics of the wireless channel to secure transmissions. Enhancing PLS in DFRC systems, for instance, is an active area of investigation, exploring architectures like hybrid beamforming to improve security [28]. The inherent sensing capabilities of ISAC systems present unique opportunities for enhancing PLS [4]. By utilizing sensing information about the environment, channel conditions, and potential eavesdropper locations, ISAC systems can potentially adapt their transmission strategies (e.g., beamforming, waveform design) to maximize the secrecy rate and counter passive or active attacks. This integration of sensing data into security mechanisms is a promising avenue for future research in ISAC PLS [4].  

Finally, the pervasive sensing capabilities enabled by ISAC technology raise significant ethical implications. The ability to collect detailed information about the environment and its occupants through wireless signals necessitates careful consideration of data ownership, consent, and the potential for misuse. Balancing the benefits of enhanced sensing for applications like autonomous systems and smart environments with the fundamental right to privacy and preventing unauthorized surveillance is a critical ethical challenge that needs to be addressed through robust policies, regulations, and privacy-aware system designs.  

# 8.4 Standardization and Regulatory Challenges  

The widespread adoption of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technologies is inherently linked to the establishment of clear standards and supportive regulatory frameworks. Standardization is crucial for ensuring interoperability, compatibility, and facilitating market development and deployment. Regulatory challenges, particularly concerning spectrum sharing and interference management, represent significant hurdles for ISAC systems. Furthermore, achieving interoperability and compatibility between diverse ISAC implementations from different vendors and across various application scenarios is a key technical and regulatory challenge.  

International bodies such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) play a pivotal role in defining the framework for future communication systems, including those incorporating ISAC capabilities. However, the process within these organizations presents its own set of challenges. Decision-making within the ITU, for instance, relies on achieving consensus among member countries [14]. This consensus-building approach, while aiming for broad agreement, implies that the finalization of standards or regulatory decisions can be significantly delayed or even prevented if a single member country opposes a proposal [14]. Such procedural impediments in international standardization bodies pose a fundamental challenge to the timely development and ratification of the necessary frameworks for ISAC, potentially slowing down its integration into future mobile communication standards like 5G-Advanced and 6G. Overcoming these challenges requires diplomatic effort and technical convergence to build the necessary consensus among diverse stakeholders.​

Beyond the radio frequency spectrum, exploring the optical spectrum for ISAC-Optical Wireless (ISAC-OW) presents opportunities, leveraging its high bandwidth, line-of-sight transmission, and immunity to RF interference [19].  

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are anticipated to play a transformative role in future ISAC systems. AInative interfaces and data-driven methods, such as variational autoencoders (VAE), are suggested for refining channel estimation and signal processing in complex environments [13,27]. AI/ML will be integral to 6G's envisioned data-driven architecture and intelligent network platforms [5]. Moreover, combining AI with physical layer security techniques is a promising research avenue to enhance the security of ISAC networks [4].​  

Future ISAC research will focus on enabling a wide range of advanced applications that will impact various industries and aspects of society. Key application scenarios include the industrial internet and emergency rescue [1]. Services like eXtended Reality (XR), encompassing augmented and virtual reality, are expected to evolve into immersive communication requiring enhanced capabilities from 6G ISAC for improved human–machine interaction [1,5]. Mobile computing networks represent another service domain benefiting from integrated sensing and communication [1]. Specific sensing applications like 3D stereoscopic imaging and THz mass spectrometry demonstrate the potential for ISAC in detailed environmental perception [9]. The high bandwidth and unique characteristics of ISAC-OW can enable applications like holographic hospitals and advanced industrial automation [19]. Enhancing physical layer security is also a critical application requirement for reliable ISAC deployment [4].​  

The development of ISAC necessitates significant interdisciplinary collaboration. Research involving zero-energy devices that harvest energy from the environment highlights the convergence with energy harvesting technologies and their role in providing data inputs for digital twins [5]. THz mass spectrometry points towards collaboration with chemistry and material science [9]. Furthermore, timely technology development and standardization efforts across various bodies and architectural layers are essential for the commercialization of 6G around 2030 and the widespread adoption of ISAC [1,14]. These interdisciplinary opportunities underscore the potential for ISAC to drive innovation across diverse sectors.​  

# 9. Conclusion
