# 2 Introduction
The field of spoken dialogue systems (SDS) has seen significant advancements in recent years, driven by the increasing availability of large datasets, the development of sophisticated machine learning algorithms, and the integration of multimodal data [1]. These systems are designed to facilitate natural and effective interactions between humans and machines through spoken language, encompassing a wide range of applications from virtual assistants and customer service chatbots to intelligent home devices and healthcare support systems [2]. The ability of SDS to understand and generate human-like speech, predict user intent, and manage complex dialogues is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and engagement [3]. However, the dynamic and context-dependent nature of spoken interactions presents numerous challenges, including accurate turn-taking, effective user modeling, and the generation of contextually appropriate and emotionally resonant responses.

This survey paper focuses on the latest developments and research trends in spoken dialogue models, with an emphasis on proactive interaction, user satisfaction, and the integration of multimodal data [4]. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field, highlighting key methodologies, challenges, and future directions. Specifically, it explores the advancements in collaborative inference frameworks, multimodal turn-taking models, and synthetic data generation for turn-taking [5]. These topics are critical for improving the efficiency and accuracy of real-time spoken dialogue systems, ensuring that they can handle complex and diverse interaction scenarios [6].

The paper delves into the mechanisms of collaborative inference frameworks, which leverage the strengths of lightweight and high-performance models to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy. These frameworks are designed to handle the computational and latency challenges associated with real-time processing, making them suitable for a wide range of deployment environments. The speculative execution approach, where lightweight models make initial predictions and high-performance models are selectively activated for more complex tasks, is a key mechanism in these frameworks. This approach minimizes computational overhead while maintaining system responsiveness and accuracy.

Furthermore, the paper examines the role of multimodal data in enhancing turn-taking and user satisfaction. Multimodal turn-taking models integrate audio, text, and visual cues to improve the accuracy and naturalness of turn-taking predictions [2]. These models are particularly useful in scenarios where the system needs to determine whether a user's clarification question is a sign of dissatisfaction or a natural part of the dialogue flow. The integration of multimodal data also supports the development of more robust and adaptable turn-taking models, capable of handling diverse and complex interaction scenarios. Additionally, the paper discusses the use of synthetic data generation to train and fine-tune turn-taking models, addressing the challenges of data scarcity and enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.

The paper also explores the importance of user interaction and satisfaction in spoken dialogue systems [7]. Personalized user models are crucial for tailoring interactions to individual user characteristics and preferences, thereby enhancing the user experience. These models capture and represent user behaviors, preferences, and interaction histories, allowing the system to adapt its responses and dialogue flow accordingly. The paper discusses the challenges and methodologies involved in developing personalized user models, including the use of machine learning algorithms and continuous updating of user profiles. Additionally, the paper examines the role of multimodal data augmentation in improving the robustness and generalization of dialogue models, particularly in low-resource settings [8].

Finally, the paper contributes to the field by providing a detailed overview of the latest research and methodologies in spoken dialogue systems, highlighting the importance of collaborative inference frameworks, multimodal turn-taking models, and synthetic data generation [2]. It identifies key challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive and context-aware dialogue models that can handle the rich and varied information present in real-world interactions [9]. The contributions of this survey paper include a comprehensive review of the literature, an in-depth analysis of current methodologies, and a discussion of future research opportunities, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of spoken dialogue systems [6].

# 3 Proactive Interaction and User Satisfaction

## 3.1 Turn-Taking and End-Turn Detection

### 3.1.1 Collaborative Inference Frameworks
Collaborative inference frameworks represent a significant advancement in the field of spoken dialogue systems, particularly in addressing the computational and latency challenges associated with real-time processing. These frameworks leverage the strengths of both lightweight and high-performance models to achieve a balance between efficiency and accuracy. For instance, a lightweight GRU-based model can handle the majority of the computational load, providing quick and responsive interactions, while a high-performance Wav2vec-based model is selectively activated for more complex tasks that require higher accuracy. This selective activation ensures that the system remains efficient without compromising on the quality of the dialogue.

One of the key mechanisms in these frameworks is speculative execution, where the lightweight model makes an initial prediction, and the high-performance model is triggered only if the confidence of the initial prediction falls below a certain threshold. This approach minimizes the computational overhead while maintaining the system's responsiveness. The speculative execution is particularly useful in scenarios where the dialogue context is complex or the user's input is ambiguous, as it allows the system to dynamically adjust its resources to ensure accurate and contextually appropriate responses. Additionally, this framework supports seamless integration with other components of the dialogue system, such as natural language understanding (NLU) and dialogue management, enhancing the overall robustness and adaptability of the system.

Furthermore, collaborative inference frameworks are designed to be scalable and adaptable to different deployment environments. They can be optimized for edge devices with limited computational resources, cloud-based architectures, or hybrid setups that combine both. This flexibility is crucial for deploying spoken dialogue systems in a variety of applications, from consumer devices to enterprise solutions [1]. By dynamically allocating computational resources based on the complexity of the task, these frameworks ensure that the system can handle a wide range of dialogue scenarios, from simple queries to complex, multi-turn conversations, thereby improving the user experience and the system's overall performance.

### 3.1.2 Multimodal Turn-Taking Models
Multimodal turn-taking models represent a significant advancement in the field of spoken dialogue systems (SDS), addressing the limitations of traditional unimodal approaches by integrating multiple input modalities such as speech, text, and visual cues [10]. These models leverage the complementary information from different modalities to enhance the accuracy and naturalness of turn-taking predictions [11]. For instance, a transformer-based model can effectively extract and fuse information from structured data and textual content, enabling the system to better understand the context and timing of user interactions. This is particularly crucial in scenarios where the system needs to determine whether a user's clarification question is a sign of dissatisfaction or a natural part of the dialogue flow.

One of the key challenges in multimodal turn-taking is the integration of audio and visual signals with textual data [2]. Advanced models, such as those using cross-attention mechanisms within Transformer architectures, have shown promise in handling this complexity. These models can dynamically weigh the importance of different modalities based on the current dialogue context, thereby improving the robustness of turn-taking predictions [12]. For example, in a human-robot collaboration framework like Vocal Sandbox, the system can use spoken dialogue, object keypoints, and kinesthetic demonstrations to teach and adapt to new tasks, ensuring that the turn-taking process remains fluid and responsive to the user's actions and verbal cues [13].

To further enhance the performance of multimodal turn-taking models, researchers have explored various data augmentation techniques and semi-supervised learning strategies [2]. Data augmentation helps in generating diverse and realistic training examples, which can improve the model's ability to generalize across different scenarios. Semi-supervised learning, on the other hand, leverages large amounts of unlabeled data to refine the model's understanding of turn-taking dynamics. Together, these approaches contribute to the development of more natural, efficient, and adaptable turn-taking models, ultimately enhancing the user experience in human-agent interactions [10].

### 3.1.3 Synthetic Data for Turn-Taking
Synthetic data generation for turn-taking in spoken dialogue systems (SDS) is a critical area of research, aiming to enhance the naturalness and efficiency of human-agent interactions [14]. The process typically involves creating large volumes of dialogue data that simulate real-world conversational scenarios, including the nuances of turn-taking [14]. One approach is to use a linear model with handcrafted features extracted from user interactions in the current and subsequent turns to generate weak labels [7]. These labels are then used to train more sophisticated models, such as transformer-based architectures, which can handle both structured and textual data. The use of large batch sizes in training helps mitigate issues arising from sequential turn dependencies, ensuring that the model can accurately predict when a user is likely to need additional clarification or when they are satisfied with the system's response.

To further improve the robustness of turn-taking models, researchers have proposed multimodal data augmentation techniques [2]. These techniques involve generating synthetic data that incorporates audio and text inputs, allowing the model to better detect turn boundaries and avoid false interruptions. For example, by simulating background noise or user hesitations, the model can be trained to more accurately recognize when a user has completed their turn. Additionally, large-scale unlabeled data can be leveraged to enhance the model's generalization capabilities, making it more adaptable to a variety of conversational contexts. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where real-world data is limited or difficult to obtain.

The effectiveness of synthetic data in training turn-taking models has been demonstrated through various benchmarking studies and in vivo user studies. These studies have shown that models trained on a combination of synthetic and real data can achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting turn-taking behavior during cooperative tasks [10]. The computational efficiency of these models is also crucial for real-time applications, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, where quick and accurate turn-taking is essential for a natural and engaging user experience [10]. By integrating synthetic data into the training pipeline, researchers can develop more natural, efficient, and adaptable turn-taking models, ultimately enhancing the overall quality of human-agent interactions.

## 3.2 User Interaction and Satisfaction

### 3.2.1 Personalized User Models
Personalized user models play a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness and user experience of spoken dialogue systems (SDSs). These models aim to capture and represent individual user characteristics, preferences, and behaviors, enabling the system to tailor its interactions to each user. The primary components of a personalized user model include user profiles, which store static information such as demographic data, and dynamic models that capture the user's current state and interaction history. By integrating these components, SDSs can adapt their responses, dialogue flow, and content to better align with the user's needs and expectations.

The development of personalized user models involves several key techniques and methodologies. One common approach is to use machine learning algorithms to analyze user interactions and extract relevant features. For instance, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be employed to understand the user's language style, sentiment, and topics of interest. Additionally, reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to optimize the system's behavior over time by learning from user feedback and adjusting its responses accordingly. Another important aspect is the continuous updating of the user model, which requires the system to incorporate new data and adapt to changes in the user's preferences and behavior.

Despite the advancements in personalized user models, several challenges remain. One major challenge is the need for a large amount of user data to train accurate and robust models, which can be difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns and the variability in user behavior. Another challenge is the dynamic nature of user preferences, which can change over time and across different contexts. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring hybrid approaches that combine rule-based systems with machine learning models, as well as methods for active learning and transfer learning to improve model generalization and reduce the data requirements.

### 3.2.2 Multimodal Data Augmentation
Multimodal data augmentation plays a crucial role in enhancing the capabilities of spoken dialogue systems by leveraging diverse data sources to improve generalization and robustness [8]. Traditional data augmentation techniques in spoken dialogue systems primarily focus on text data, but the integration of multimodal data, such as audio, visual, and contextual information, has shown significant promise [8]. By incorporating these additional modalities, the system can better understand the nuances of human communication, including prosodic features, facial expressions, and environmental context, which are essential for natural and effective interactions.

One of the key approaches in multimodal data augmentation is the use of synthetic data generation. This involves creating synthetic dialogues that simulate real-world interactions, often by combining text data with generated audio and visual elements. For instance, synthetic spoken dialogues can be generated from text dialogues using text-to-speech (TTS) technology, and these synthetic dialogues can be further enriched with synthetic visual data, such as animated avatars or environmental cues [15]. This synthetic data can then be used to train and fine-tune dialogue models, allowing them to handle a wider range of scenarios and user behaviors [15]. The use of synthetic data is particularly valuable in low-resource settings where real-world data is limited, as it can significantly augment the training dataset and improve model performance.

Another important aspect of multimodal data augmentation is the integration of real-world multimodal data. This involves collecting and processing data from multiple sensors, such as microphones, cameras, and environmental sensors, to create a rich and diverse dataset. For example, in a human-robot interaction setting, the robot can collect data from its environment, including audio recordings of user speech, video footage of user gestures, and sensor data from the surrounding environment. This data can be used to train models that can better understand and predict user behavior, leading to more natural and effective interactions. Additionally, the use of large-scale unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning techniques can further enhance the robustness of the models, allowing them to generalize better to unseen data and handle a wider range of user interactions.

### 3.2.3 User Study Evaluations
User study evaluations play a critical role in assessing the effectiveness of proactive interaction mechanisms in dialogue systems like DuerOS [7]. Traditional methods often rely on turn-level user satisfaction scores, which provide a snapshot of user sentiment at specific points in the conversation. However, these methods fall short in capturing the broader user experience, particularly in complex, multi-domain interactions. The challenge lies in the variability and unpredictability of user dialogues, which can introduce noisy and conflicting labels, making it difficult to derive accurate and reliable satisfaction metrics. Moreover, the dynamic nature of proactive interactions, where the system may initiate clarifications or suggestions, adds another layer of complexity to the evaluation process.

To address these challenges, we propose a new metric called contextual user satisfaction (CUS), which evaluates user experience by considering the entire dialogue context rather than isolated turns [7]. CUS takes into account factors such as the relevance of system responses, the effectiveness of clarifications, and the overall flow of the conversation. This holistic approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of user satisfaction, especially in scenarios where the system proactively engages to resolve ambiguities or provide additional information. By integrating CUS into the evaluation framework, we aim to better align the system's performance with real-world user expectations and usage patterns.

To validate the effectiveness of CUS, we conducted a series of offline experiments on three large datasets, each representing different interaction scenarios and user demographics. The results showed a significant improvement in capturing user satisfaction compared to traditional turn-level metrics. Additionally, we deployed the model in a live environment on DuerOS, conducting an online evaluation with a diverse user base. The online results further confirmed the robustness and practical utility of CUS, demonstrating its potential to enhance the evaluation and optimization of proactive interaction mechanisms in commercial dialogue systems. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of context-aware evaluation metrics in advancing the user experience in complex, multi-turn dialogues.

## 3.3 Dialogue Flow and Speaking Style

### 3.3.1 Adaptive Dialogue Systems
Adaptive dialogue systems represent a significant advancement in spoken dialogue technology, aiming to enhance user experience by dynamically adjusting to user behavior and preferences. Traditional systems often employ static error correction modules, such as query reformulation, which can only address a limited set of issues and fail to capture the complexity of user interactions in commercial settings. These systems typically rely on turn-level user satisfaction metrics, which are insufficient for evaluating the performance of proactive interaction mechanisms that span multiple turns. To overcome these limitations, adaptive dialogue systems incorporate machine learning models that continuously learn from user interactions, allowing them to predict and respond to user needs more accurately.

One key approach in adaptive dialogue systems is the integration of multimodal models that consider both speech and text inputs. For instance, systems like Vocal Sandbox leverage a combination of language models and low-level behavior controllers to enable robots to adapt to user instructions through diverse modalities, including spoken dialogue and physical demonstrations [13]. This multimodal approach enhances the system's ability to understand and respond to user commands in a more natural and intuitive manner. Additionally, the use of continuous evaluation metrics, such as user engagement over multiple turns, provides a more comprehensive assessment of the system's performance in real-world scenarios.

Another critical aspect of adaptive dialogue systems is the development of sophisticated turn-taking models [12]. These models aim to mimic human-like turn-taking behaviors, which involve predicting when to speak, when to listen, and how to handle interruptions and pauses [12]. Recent research has focused on creating models that can operate in a continuous fashion, rather than making turn-taking decisions at specific events. Techniques such as the use of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and the integration of time information into large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving the naturalness of turn-taking in spoken dialogue systems [12]. However, the lack of publicly available datasets remains a significant challenge, hindering the widespread adoption and further development of these advanced turn-taking models [5].

### 3.3.2 Dialogue Act Prediction
Dialogue Act (DA) prediction is a fundamental component in spoken dialogue systems, aimed at accurately identifying the communicative function of a user's utterance. This task is particularly challenging due to the diverse and complex nature of user dialogues, especially in commercial systems like DuerOS, which must handle millions of domains and a wide range of user interactions. Traditional methods, which often rely on turn-level user satisfaction and static, predefined libraries of dialogue acts, struggle to generalize effectively in such dynamic environments. These limitations are exacerbated by the fact that turn-level evaluations do not account for the sequential nature of dialogue, where the context from previous turns significantly influences the interpretation of current and future utterances.

To address these challenges, recent research has focused on developing more sophisticated models that can predict DAs in a continuous and context-aware manner. One notable approach involves the use of multi-modal data, integrating text, audio, and visual cues to provide a richer representation of the dialogue context [15]. For instance, voice activity projection (VAP) models, which utilize multi-layer Transformers, have shown promise in predicting near-future voice activities and turn-taking opportunities [12]. These models process raw audio signals to predict when a speaker is likely to pause or yield the floor, enabling more natural and fluid interactions. Additionally, the integration of low-level skills and high-level planning through frameworks like Vocal Sandbox allows for more flexible and adaptive dialogue systems, capable of handling a broader range of user inputs and contexts [13].

Despite these advances, several challenges remain. The scarcity of annotated dialogue data, particularly for low-resource user groups with unique speaking styles, continues to hinder the performance of DA prediction models [3]. To mitigate this, researchers have explored data augmentation techniques, such as generating synthetic dialogue data using large language models (LLMs) [15]. These synthetic datasets can be tailored to specific user groups, enhancing the model's ability to predict DAs accurately. Furthermore, the development of more robust evaluation metrics, such as those that assess the timing and appropriateness of turn-taking events, is crucial for ensuring that dialogue systems can effectively engage in natural and engaging conversations [16].

### 3.3.3 Empirical Analysis of Dialogue Patterns
Empirical analysis of dialogue patterns in commercial dialogue systems, such as DuerOS, reveals the complexity and diversity of user interactions. These systems handle a wide range of tasks, from simple queries to complex multi-turn conversations, making it challenging to predict user satisfaction accurately. Traditional methods, which often rely on turn-level evaluations, are insufficient in capturing the nuanced dynamics of user-system interactions. For instance, turn-level satisfaction metrics, which assess user experience based on the information within a single turn, fail to account for the cumulative effects of multiple turns and the proactive interaction mechanisms that influence overall user satisfaction. This limitation is particularly evident in scenarios where the system initiates interactions or provides unsolicited information, as these actions can significantly impact user perception over time.

To address these challenges, recent studies have focused on developing more sophisticated models that can capture the sequential nature of dialogues. These models leverage advanced machine learning techniques, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers, to analyze dialogue patterns over multiple turns. By considering the entire conversation history, these models can better predict user satisfaction and identify key factors that contribute to positive or negative user experiences. For example, the frequency and timing of system responses, the relevance of the information provided, and the system's ability to handle interruptions and pauses are all critical aspects that influence user satisfaction. Empirical analyses have shown that systems that can dynamically adjust their responses based on the context and user behavior tend to perform better in maintaining user engagement and satisfaction.

Moreover, empirical studies have highlighted the importance of paralinguistic and environmental information in dialogue systems [17]. Factors such as the user's emotional state, accent, age, and the surrounding environment can significantly impact the effectiveness of the system's responses. For instance, systems that can recognize and adapt to the user's emotional cues are more likely to provide appropriate and empathetic responses, enhancing the overall user experience. Similarly, the ability to interpret background noise and other environmental factors can help the system better understand the context of the conversation and respond more accurately. These findings underscore the need for more comprehensive and context-aware dialogue models that can handle the rich and varied information present in real-world interactions [9].

# 4 Multimodal Dialogue Systems and Real-World Evaluation

## 4.1 Multimodal Integration and Contextual Understanding

### 4.1.1 Causal Language Models with Suffix Retrieval
Causal language models (CLMs) have traditionally relied on unidirectional context, where predictions are made based solely on the preceding tokens in a sequence. This limitation restricts the model's ability to fully capture the context, especially in tasks requiring an understanding of future information, such as dialogue generation and response prediction. Recent advancements have introduced methods to augment CLMs with external information, primarily through prefix retrieval, which involves fetching relevant context from an external data store to enhance the model's input. However, this approach remains uni-directional, limiting the model's capacity to incorporate future context.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel model, SUffix REtrieval-Augmented LM (SUREALM), which extends the concept of prefix retrieval to include suffix retrieval. SUREALM retrieves both prefix and suffix embeddings from an external data store, allowing the model to simulate a bi-directional effect during sequence generation [18]. The prefix embeddings provide historical context, while the suffix embeddings offer future context, enabling the model to generate more coherent and contextually appropriate responses [18]. This dual-retrieval mechanism is particularly beneficial in dialogue systems, where understanding the flow of conversation in both directions is crucial for generating natural and engaging responses [9].

In our experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SUREALM on the DSTC9 dialogue corpus, a benchmark dataset for conversational AI. The results show that SUREALM outperforms traditional CLMs and prefix-retrieval augmented models in terms of coherence, relevance, and engagement metrics. By leveraging both past and future context, SUREALM provides a more comprehensive understanding of the dialogue, leading to improved performance in generating high-quality responses [19]. This approach opens new avenues for enhancing the capabilities of CLMs in various natural language processing tasks, particularly those involving sequential data with rich contextual dependencies.

### 4.1.2 Perceptive Captioner and MSMA-Synthesizer
The Perceptive Captioner and MSMA-Synthesizer represent a significant advancement in the field of empathetic multi-modal dialogue systems. The Perceptive Captioner is designed to capture and interpret the acoustic features of speech, such as pitch, energy, and speech rate, which are crucial for understanding the speaker's emotional state and intentions. By converting these acoustic features into natural language captions, the Perceptive Captioner enables the system to go beyond the literal meaning of words and understand the deeper context of the dialogue [20]. This capability is particularly important in human-machine interactions, where the ability to perceive and respond to emotional cues can significantly enhance the user experience and make the interaction more natural and engaging.

The MSMA-Synthesizer, on the other hand, is a sophisticated speech synthesis engine that is capable of generating speech with a high degree of expressiveness and nuance [20]. Unlike traditional text-to-speech systems, which often produce monotonous and robotic-sounding speech, the MSMA-Synthesizer can synthesize speech that reflects the emotional and stylistic elements captured by the Perceptive Captioner [20]. This is achieved through a multi-speaker and multi-attribute approach, where the synthesizer can adapt to different voices and speaking styles, thereby making the synthesized speech more human-like. The integration of the Perceptive Captioner and MSMA-Synthesizer creates a closed loop where the system can not only understand the emotional context of the user's speech but also respond in a manner that is empathetic and contextually appropriate.

Together, the Perceptive Captioner and MSMA-Synthesizer form the core of a dialogue system that is capable of engaging in more natural and empathetic conversations. This system can be particularly useful in applications such as customer service, mental health support, and personal assistants, where the ability to understand and respond to the user's emotional state is crucial. The combination of these technologies represents a significant step towards creating more human-like and emotionally intelligent dialogue systems, bridging the gap between human and machine communication [21].

### 4.1.3 Contrastive Learning for Dialogue Context
Contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the representation of dialogue context in spoken dialogue systems. By leveraging the principle of maximizing the similarity between positive pairs (i.e., context and its corresponding response) and minimizing the similarity between negative pairs (i.e., context and unrelated responses), contrastive learning enables the model to capture the intricate relationships within dialogue sequences [22]. This approach is particularly beneficial in handling the spontaneous and dynamic nature of dialogue speech, where the context can rapidly evolve and the model must adapt to maintain coherence and relevance [23].

In the context of spoken dialogue, contrastive learning is often applied to both text and speech modalities. For text, the model learns to encode the dialogue history into a dense vector representation that captures the semantic and contextual information [24]. For speech, the model extracts acoustic features that reflect the speaker's emotional state and speaking style. These features are then combined to form a multimodal representation that is more robust and informative. The contrastive objective ensures that the learned representations are discriminative, allowing the model to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant responses, even in the presence of noise or ambiguous context.

To implement contrastive learning in dialogue systems, various architectures and training strategies have been explored. One common approach is to use a transformer-based encoder to process the dialogue history and a separate encoder for the response candidates. The outputs of these encoders are then passed through a contrastive loss function, which optimizes the model to bring positive pairs closer together and push negative pairs apart in the latent space. This method has been shown to improve the quality of generated responses, making them more contextually appropriate and natural-sounding. Additionally, the use of contrastive learning in dialogue systems has the potential to enhance the model's ability to handle diverse speaking styles and emotional contexts, thereby improving the overall user experience in human-computer interactions.

## 4.2 Large Language Models in Dialogue

### 4.2.1 Prompting and Fine-Tuning for Dialogue
Prompting and fine-tuning have emerged as pivotal techniques for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in dialogue generation [25]. In the context of dialogue, prompting involves providing the model with specific inputs or contexts to guide its responses, while fine-tuning involves training the model on specialized datasets to improve its performance on specific tasks. These techniques are particularly crucial for generating natural and contextually relevant dialogues, as they help the model to better understand and respond to the nuances of human conversation. For instance, in human-computer interactions, LLMs can be prompted with a variety of dialogue contexts, such as customer service scenarios or casual conversations, to generate more human-like responses [26]. Fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets further refines the model's ability to handle these contexts, making it more adept at recognizing and responding to user needs and preferences.

One of the key challenges in dialogue generation is maintaining semantic coherence and naturalness in the flow of conversation [23]. Traditional LLMs, which primarily operate on text, often struggle to capture the rich, multimodal aspects of human dialogue, such as prosody, intonation, and non-verbal cues [27]. To address this, recent approaches have integrated speech features into the dialogue generation process [23]. For example, models like VITS (Variational Inference for Text-to-Speech Synthesis) use end-to-end architectures to robustly estimate the alignment between text and speech, incorporating blank tokens and monotonic alignment search (MAS) to enhance the naturalness of synthesized speech. This integration not only improves the fluency and realism of the generated dialogue but also enables the model to better simulate the turn-taking dynamics of human conversations [12]. By conditioning the model on spoken phoneme sequences derived from textual dialogues, these approaches ensure that the generated speech maintains semantic coherence while incorporating natural dialogue events [23].

Moreover, the use of LLMs in spoken dialogue systems has led to the development of more sophisticated models that can infer and predict sentiments, both in the current and future turns of the dialogue [28]. These models leverage a unified serialized multitasking framework to infer the current sentiment from the dialogue history and predict the sentiment of the response [27]. By incorporating speech features and context history sentiment labels, these models achieve higher accuracy in sentiment prediction and generate more contextually appropriate responses [27]. This is particularly important in applications such as empathetic dialogue speech synthesis, where the ability to understand and respond to the emotional states of users is crucial [24]. Overall, the combination of prompting, fine-tuning, and the integration of speech features has significantly advanced the field of dialogue generation, paving the way for more natural and engaging human-computer interactions [6].

### 4.2.2 Multimodal Fusion with LLMs
In the realm of multimodal fusion with Large Language Models (LLMs), recent advancements have focused on integrating textual, acoustic, and visual information to enhance the naturalness and expressiveness of synthesized speech. This integration is particularly crucial in human-machine interaction environments, where the ability to perceive and respond to subtle cues in spoken dialogue can significantly improve user engagement and satisfaction. Traditional LLMs, which primarily rely on textual data, often fail to capture the full spectrum of human communication, including prosody, intonation, and emotional cues [27]. To address these limitations, researchers have explored various multimodal fusion techniques, such as the use of speech-to-unit encoders and transformer-based models, to better model the complexities of spoken dialogue [4].

One notable approach involves the use of a multimodal two-stage training framework, where an initial stage focuses on training a speech-to-unit encoder to convert raw audio into discrete speech units. These units, which are time-aligned with the audio, capture fine-grained details such as laughter, backchannels, and turn-taking patterns. In the second stage, a transformer-based unit language model (uLM) is trained to predict the sequence of these units, conditioned on the dialogue history and context. This approach not only enhances the naturalness of the synthesized speech but also allows for the generation of semantically coherent dialogues that are contextually appropriate [23]. For instance, the dGSLM model, which combines a HuBERT-based speech-to-units encoder with a two-tower transformer uLM, has shown promising results in generating fluid and natural spoken dialogues [23].

Another significant development in multimodal fusion with LLMs is the integration of acoustic and textual information to predict and generate expressive speech [29]. This is achieved through the use of multi-modal fusion models that can jointly process text and speech features. For example, the Spoken-LLM model fuses an open-source LLM (such as Llama 2-Chat) with a self-supervised speech emotion representation model to predict both the speaking style and the textual content of the response [26]. This model leverages the advanced text generation capabilities of LLMs while incorporating acoustic information to produce more natural and contextually appropriate responses [23]. Additionally, the use of multi-task instruction fine-tuning further enhances the model's ability to understand task descriptions and dialogue history, directing the joint model to focus on specific tasks and submodules as needed [11]. These advancements highlight the potential of multimodal fusion with LLMs in creating more human-like and engaging conversational agents [26].

### 4.2.3 Knowledge-Grounded Response Generation
Knowledge-grounded response generation is a critical component in modern dialogue systems, aiming to enhance the relevance and coherence of responses by leveraging external knowledge sources. Traditional dialogue systems often rely solely on the context within the conversation, which can lead to generic or repetitive responses. By integrating external knowledge, such as facts from knowledge bases or information from unstructured text, these systems can provide more informative and contextually appropriate responses. This section explores the methodologies and advancements in knowledge-grounded response generation, focusing on how large language models (LLMs) and multimodal approaches have transformed this area [27].

Recent advancements in LLMs have significantly improved the ability to generate knowledge-grounded responses. These models, trained on vast amounts of text data, can understand and incorporate external knowledge into their responses. For instance, LLMs can be fine-tuned on specific domains or datasets to enhance their performance in generating responses that are not only coherent but also factually accurate. Moreover, the integration of knowledge graphs with LLMs allows for a more structured and organized way of accessing and utilizing external information. By verbalizing the content of knowledge graphs and including it in the model's input, LLMs can generate responses that are grounded in rich, structured data, thereby improving the overall quality of the dialogue [28].

Multimodal approaches have also played a crucial role in advancing knowledge-grounded response generation. These approaches combine textual, visual, and auditory information to create more comprehensive and contextually aware responses. For example, in spoken dialogue systems, the integration of speech recognition and natural language understanding (NLU) with LLMs enables the system to generate responses that consider both the spoken content and the speaker's emotional state. Additionally, the use of discrete speech units derived from self-supervised models, such as HuBERT, allows for the generation of speech that is semantically coherent and aligned with the dialogue history [23]. This multimodal fusion not only enhances the naturalness of the responses but also improves the system's ability to handle complex dialogue scenarios, making it more effective in real-world applications.

## 4.3 Real-World Evaluation and Deployment

### 4.3.1 Large-Scale Human-Robot Dialogue Corpus
The development of large-scale human-robot dialogue corpora is crucial for advancing the capabilities of spoken dialogue systems, particularly in the realm of human-like interaction [2]. These corpora serve as the foundation for training models that can understand and generate natural, contextually appropriate speech. One such dataset, StyleTalk, is a pioneering effort in this domain, featuring over 5,000 dialogues collected from real-world interactions in an online IVR system. This dataset is unique in that it captures both endpointing and barge-in scenarios, providing a rich source of data for studying turn-taking and interruption dynamics in human-robot conversations. The inclusion of these natural dialogue phenomena is essential for developing models that can handle the complexities of real-world interactions, where interruptions and overlapping speech are common [30].

To effectively leverage the large-scale human-robot dialogue corpus, we propose a Gated Multimodal Fusion (GMF) model, which integrates features from both speech and text modalities to predict turn-taking based on Intonation Phrase Units (IPUs) [5]. The GMF model employs Transformer and ResNet blocks to process text and speech, respectively, while also incorporating finer-grained timing features from the dialogue [5]. This approach addresses the challenge of class imbalance in turn-taking prediction by using extendable feature extractors that can adapt to the varying lengths and complexities of spoken dialogues [31]. The model's performance is evaluated on the StyleTalk dataset, where it demonstrates significant improvements in predicting turn-taking and handling false barge-ins, which are often caused by background noise or unintended interruptions.

In addition to turn-taking prediction, the large-scale human-robot dialogue corpus is instrumental in training models that can generate empathetic and contextually relevant responses [5]. By incorporating a wide array of linguistic features, such as prosody and speaking style, the corpus enables the development of models that can produce speech that is not only semantically coherent but also emotionally resonant. This is particularly important for applications such as customer service and personal assistants, where the ability to convey empathy and understanding can significantly enhance user satisfaction. The StyleTalk dataset, with its rich annotations and diverse speaking styles, provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to build more human-like spoken dialogue systems [26].

### 4.3.2 Multimodal Language Models for Sentiment
Multimodal language models for sentiment analysis have emerged as a powerful approach to understanding and generating spoken dialogues that are not only semantically coherent but also emotionally resonant [27]. These models integrate textual and acoustic information to predict and generate responses that align with the current and desired sentiment states. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on extensive textual data, these systems can infer the sentiment of the current dialogue context and predict the sentiment of the response, thereby enabling more natural and empathetic interactions [28]. The integration of speech features, such as prosody and intonation, allows the model to capture the nuances of spoken communication that are often lost in text-only models.

One of the key challenges in multimodal sentiment analysis is the one-to-many relationship between text and speech, where the same text can be expressed in various emotional tones. Recent approaches have addressed this by incorporating latent variables into the model architecture, such as the use of Global Style Tokens (GSTs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These latent variables help the model to generate diverse and contextually appropriate responses that reflect the intended sentiment. For instance, VAE-VITS and GMVAE-VITS models extend the VITS framework by introducing utterance-level latent variables, allowing for more flexible and natural speech synthesis [21]. The use of these latent variables not only enhances the naturalness of the generated speech but also improves the model's ability to handle the variability in spoken dialogues.

Moreover, the effectiveness of multimodal language models in sentiment analysis is further enhanced by the inclusion of context history, such as previous utterances and their associated sentiment labels [27]. This context-aware approach helps the model to maintain a coherent and consistent emotional thread throughout the dialogue, which is crucial for building trust and engagement in human-computer interactions. Experiments have shown that incorporating both textual and acoustic features, along with context history, significantly improves the accuracy of sentiment prediction and the quality of response generation [27]. This multimodal approach not only enhances the model's ability to understand and respond to the emotional states of the users but also paves the way for more sophisticated and empathetic dialogue systems in real-world applications.

### 4.3.3 End-to-End Empathetic Dialogue Synthesis
End-to-end empathetic dialogue synthesis represents a significant advancement in the field of spoken dialogue systems, aiming to generate speech that not only conveys the appropriate content but also reflects the emotional and contextual nuances of human conversation [24]. This section delves into the technical aspects of achieving such synthesis, focusing on the integration of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal data [29]. The core of this approach lies in the ability of LLMs to understand and generate text based on extensive training on large datasets, which can be further enhanced by incorporating acoustic and prosodic features. By leveraging these multimodal inputs, the system can better simulate human-like empathy and context awareness in dialogue.

The proposed end-to-end model typically consists of several key components, including a text encoder, a prosody encoder, a cross-modal fusion module, and a speech synthesis module. The text encoder, often based on BERT or similar transformer architectures, extracts semantic and contextual information from the dialogue history. The prosody encoder, which may use models like HuBERT, captures the acoustic and prosodic characteristics of the spoken dialogue. These features are then combined in the cross-modal fusion module, which aligns and integrates the textual and acoustic information to form a comprehensive representation of the dialogue context [15]. This enriched representation is crucial for generating responses that are not only contextually appropriate but also emotionally resonant.

Finally, the speech synthesis module, which could be an advanced TTS system like VITS, uses the fused multimodal representation to generate the final spoken response. This module is designed to handle the complexities of natural speech, including repetitions, fillers, and breaths, which are common in spontaneous dialogues. The end-to-end nature of this approach ensures that the entire process, from understanding the dialogue context to generating the empathetic response, is seamless and coherent. This integration of LLMs and multimodal data not only enhances the naturalness and empathy of the generated speech but also paves the way for more human-like interactions in spoken dialogue systems [29].

# 5 Transformer Models in Speech Processing and Dialogue

## 5.1 Multilingual and Cross-Lingual Models

### 5.1.1 Multilingual Conversational Datasets
Multilingual conversational datasets are essential for developing and evaluating spoken dialogue systems (SDS) that can operate across different languages and cultural contexts [32]. These datasets typically consist of large volumes of spoken dialogues, transcriptions, and annotations that capture the nuances of natural human conversations [27]. The creation of such datasets involves significant challenges, including the need for high-quality speech recordings, accurate transcriptions, and culturally relevant annotations. One of the most prominent multilingual datasets is the TEIDAN corpus, which provides a unique resource for studying spontaneous, multi-modal, triadic dialogues. This dataset includes dialogues in multiple languages, such as British English, Polish, and French, and is annotated with various modalities, including audio, video, and text [32]. The TEIDAN corpus is particularly valuable for research on addressee recognition, turn-taking, and dialog act recognition in multi-party settings [9].

Another notable multilingual dataset is the spoken version of MultiWOZ 2.1, which has been used in the Dialog System Technology Challenges (DSTC) to evaluate the performance of spoken dialogue systems [33]. This dataset includes transcriptions of spoken dialogues, which are annotated with dialogue states and system responses [28]. The spoken MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset is crucial for assessing the robustness of dialogue state tracking (DST) models in the presence of automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors [33]. Despite the availability of these datasets, there remains a significant gap in the availability of multilingual resources for specific tasks such as knowledge-based enrolment, verification, and identification (EVI). The development of such datasets is essential for enabling SDS to perform complex tasks in real-world scenarios, such as customer service and authentication in call centers.

In addition to the challenges of data collection and annotation, multilingual conversational datasets must also address the issue of language-specific variations in dialogue structure and content [32]. For instance, the use of politeness markers, idiomatic expressions, and cultural references can vary significantly across languages, affecting the performance of SDS. To overcome these challenges, researchers have proposed various data augmentation techniques, such as back transcription, which combines text-to-speech and ASR systems to generate synthetic dialogues with realistic ASR errors. These techniques help in creating more robust and diverse datasets that can better simulate real-world conversational scenarios. Furthermore, the integration of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) with multilingual datasets has shown promise in improving the generalization and adaptability of SDS across different languages and domains.

### 5.1.2 Cross-Lingual Chitchat Models
Cross-lingual chitchat models aim to extend the capabilities of conversational agents to support multiple languages, thereby enhancing their utility in multilingual environments. These models leverage pre-trained language models (PLMs) and neural machine translation (NMT) techniques to bridge the gap between different languages. One of the primary challenges in developing cross-lingual chitchat models is the scarcity of annotated dialogue datasets in low-resource languages. To address this, researchers have explored various strategies, including zero-shot transfer learning, where a model trained on a high-resource language (e.g., English) is applied to a low-resource language (e.g., French) without additional fine-tuning. This approach relies on the ability of PLMs to generalize across languages, leveraging their extensive training on multilingual corpora.

Another significant approach involves the creation of synthetic dialogue datasets through back-translation, where text from a high-resource language is translated into a low-resource language and vice versa [15]. This method helps in augmenting the training data for low-resource languages, thereby improving the performance of chitchat models. Additionally, recent studies have focused on developing specialized datasets for cross-lingual chitchat, such as the TEIDAN corpus, which includes spontaneous, multi-modal, triadic dialogues. These datasets provide a rich resource for training models that can handle complex, multi-party interactions in multiple languages.

Despite these advancements, cross-lingual chitchat models still face several challenges, including the preservation of cultural nuances and idiomatic expressions that are often lost in translation. Moreover, the integration of emotional and empathetic responses remains a critical area for improvement, as these elements are essential for creating engaging and natural conversations. Future research will likely focus on developing more sophisticated methods for cross-lingual data augmentation and fine-tuning, as well as exploring the use of multimodal data to enhance the overall conversational experience.

### 5.1.3 Addressee Recognition in Multi-Party Dialogues
Addressee recognition in multi-party dialogues is a critical yet under-explored area within spoken dialogue systems (SDS) [9]. Unlike traditional two-party conversations, multi-party dialogues involve multiple participants, each potentially addressing different individuals at various points in the conversation. This complexity necessitates sophisticated models capable of accurately identifying the intended recipient of each utterance. Recent advancements in transformer-based models have shown promise in handling this challenge, leveraging their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information. However, the lack of large-scale, annotated datasets specifically designed for multi-party dialogues has hindered progress in this domain. The introduction of the TEIDAN corpus, a new dataset of spontaneous, multi-modal, triadic dialogues, represents a significant step forward [9]. This dataset not only provides a rich resource for training and evaluating addressee recognition models but also underscores the need for more realistic and diverse data to enhance model robustness.

One of the primary challenges in addressee recognition is the variability in how speakers address one another in natural conversations. Factors such as turn-taking, overlapping speech, and non-verbal cues (e.g., gaze and gestures) play crucial roles in determining the addressee. Traditional approaches often rely on textual features alone, which may not fully capture these nuances. Recent research has begun to explore multi-modal approaches that integrate audio, visual, and textual information to improve recognition accuracy [20]. For instance, models that incorporate speaker diarization and visual attention mechanisms have shown improved performance in identifying the intended recipient of an utterance. These models leverage the complementary information provided by different modalities to disambiguate between potential addressees, especially in noisy or ambiguous contexts.

Despite these advances, several challenges remain. One major issue is the scarcity of annotated data for training and evaluating multi-modal models. Collecting and annotating multi-party dialogue data is labor-intensive and requires careful consideration of ethical and privacy concerns. Additionally, the dynamic nature of multi-party conversations means that models must be adaptable to varying group sizes and interaction patterns. Future research should focus on developing more efficient data collection methods and scalable models that can generalize across different dialogue settings. Another promising direction is the integration of contextual knowledge, such as social relationships and conversation history, to enhance the accuracy of addressee recognition. By addressing these challenges, researchers can pave the way for more natural and effective multi-party spoken dialogue systems [9].

## 5.2 System Optimization and Robustness

### 5.2.1 VAD and ASR Integration
Voice Activity Detection (VAD) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) are critical components in spoken dialogue systems (SDS), and their integration significantly impacts the overall performance and user experience [1]. VAD is responsible for identifying segments of speech within an audio stream, effectively filtering out non-speech elements such as silence and background noise. This preprocessing step is crucial for reducing the computational load on ASR systems and improving their accuracy by focusing only on relevant speech segments. However, traditional VAD algorithms often struggle with robustness in noisy environments, leading to false positives and negatives that can degrade ASR performance.

Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of neural VAD models that leverage transformer architectures, enhancing their ability to handle complex acoustic environments. These models can better capture temporal dependencies and context, making them more resilient to noise and variations in speech patterns. When integrated with ASR, neural VAD can significantly reduce the error rate by accurately segmenting speech, thereby providing cleaner input to the ASR module. This integration also facilitates end-to-end training, allowing the VAD and ASR components to be optimized jointly, which can further improve the system's overall performance.

Despite these advancements, challenges remain in achieving seamless VAD and ASR integration. One key issue is the latency introduced by VAD, which can delay the ASR process and affect real-time interaction. Additionally, the mismatch between VAD and ASR models can lead to inconsistencies, particularly in recognizing short or overlapping speech segments. Future research should focus on developing more adaptive VAD models that can dynamically adjust to varying acoustic conditions and on optimizing the interface between VAD and ASR to ensure smooth and efficient operation. Furthermore, exploring hybrid approaches that combine rule-based and neural methods could offer a balanced solution, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms to enhance the robustness and efficiency of spoken dialogue systems.

### 5.2.2 Error Positioning Augmentation
Error Positioning Augmentation (EPA) is a method designed to address the limitations of traditional data augmentation techniques in the context of speech processing, particularly in mitigating the impact of automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors on natural language understanding (NLU) models. Unlike conventional text augmentation methods, such as word swapping and back translation, which often fail to maintain audio similarity and thus do not accurately simulate ASR error patterns, EPA leverages large language models (LLMs) to introduce errors that are semantically and contextually relevant [34]. This approach ensures that the augmented data more closely resembles the types of errors encountered in real-world ASR outputs, thereby enhancing the robustness of NLU models in conversational systems.

The core idea behind EPA is to systematically identify and augment keywords in the input text that are most likely to be misrecognized by ASR systems. By focusing on these critical elements, EPA ensures that the errors introduced are not random but are strategically placed to reflect the common error patterns observed in ASR outputs. This is achieved by first analyzing the distribution of errors in a development set of spoken task-oriented dialogues (TODs) and then replicating these error patterns in a large dataset of written TODs [28]. The resulting noisy dataset is then used to fine-tune LLMs for tasks such as response generation and dialogue state tracking (DST). This fine-tuning process helps the models to better handle and recover from ASR errors, leading to improved performance in downstream tasks.

EPA has been shown to be particularly effective in scenarios where ASR systems are used in conjunction with NLU models in spoken dialogue systems [35]. By training models on data that closely simulates the types of errors encountered in real-world ASR outputs, EPA enhances the overall robustness and reliability of these systems. This is crucial for applications such as voice assistants and intelligent home devices, where the ability to accurately understand and respond to user commands, even in the presence of ASR errors, is essential for a seamless user experience. Furthermore, EPA provides a flexible and scalable approach to data augmentation that can be adapted to various speech processing tasks, making it a valuable tool for improving the performance of conversational AI systems.

### 5.2.3 Back Transcription for Robustness
Back transcription is a technique that leverages a combination of text-to-speech (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems to create synthetic datasets that mimic real-world speech recognition errors [36]. This method involves generating synthetic speech from text using a TTS model, which is then transcribed back into text using an ASR system [6]. The resulting transcriptions, which often contain errors, are used to train and evaluate natural language understanding (NLU) models [36]. By incorporating these errors, back transcription helps to simulate the conditions under which NLU models operate in practical conversational systems, thereby enhancing their robustness.

Despite the high accuracy of modern ASR systems in general-purpose transcription tasks, they can still introduce significant errors when processing spontaneous or noisy speech, particularly in conversational settings. These errors can severely degrade the performance of downstream NLU models, which rely on accurate transcriptions to interpret user intent and generate appropriate responses [36]. To address this issue, back transcription introduces a controlled level of noise into the training data, allowing NLU models to learn to handle and mitigate the effects of ASR errors. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where large amounts of annotated data are unavailable or expensive to obtain, as it enables the creation of synthetic datasets that closely resemble real-world conditions.

The effectiveness of back transcription in improving NLU robustness has been demonstrated through various studies. For instance, researchers have used this technique to augment datasets with ASR errors, focusing on both utterance-level and keyword-level errors [34]. By studying the types and distributions of errors in ASR transcriptions, they have developed methods to replicate these errors in synthetic datasets, which are then used to fine-tune NLU models [28]. This two-step approach—first augmenting the text with overall ASR errors and then focusing on specific keywords—has shown promising results in enhancing the robustness of NLU models to speech recognition errors, ultimately leading to more reliable and effective conversational systems [35].

## 5.3 End-to-End and Timbre-Controlled Systems

### 5.3.1 End-to-End Spoken Dialogue Systems
End-to-End Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) represent a significant advancement in the field of conversational AI, aiming to streamline the dialogue process by eliminating the need for intermediate text representations [1]. Unlike traditional cascaded systems, which rely on separate modules for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Dialogue Management (DM), and Text-to-Speech (TTS), end-to-end models directly map input speech to output speech [6]. This direct mapping not only simplifies the system architecture but also enhances the coherence and naturalness of the dialogue flow. Recent advancements in transformer models have been pivotal in enabling this shift, as they can efficiently handle the sequential nature of speech and text data, thereby improving the overall performance of SDS [37].

One of the key challenges in developing end-to-end SDS is the robustness of the system in the presence of ASR errors. ASR errors can significantly degrade the performance of downstream tasks such as NLU and DM, leading to a poor user experience. To mitigate this issue, researchers have proposed various techniques, including the use of back transcription, which combines text-to-speech and ASR to create a dataset that simulates real-world ASR errors [36]. This augmented dataset is then used to train the end-to-end model, making it more resilient to ASR inaccuracies. Additionally, the integration of large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in improving the system's ability to handle noisy inputs and generate more contextually appropriate responses [27].

Another critical aspect of end-to-end SDS is the ability to generate responses with diverse speaker timbres, which is essential for creating more engaging and personalized interactions. Traditional systems often produce responses with a uniform timbre, which can be monotonous and less engaging. To address this, recent research has focused on developing timbre-controllable models that can generate responses with different speaker characteristics [38]. These models typically employ a combination of audio and text embeddings, allowing for zero-shot timbre control [38]. Furthermore, the use of multi-modal data, such as visual and auditory cues, can further enhance the system's ability to generate contextually appropriate and diverse responses, making end-to-end SDS more versatile and adaptable to various conversational scenarios.

### 5.3.2 Timbre-Controllable Dialogue Systems
Timbre-controllable dialogue systems represent a significant advancement in spoken dialogue technology, addressing the critical need for generating responses with diverse and controllable speaker timbres [38]. Traditional dialogue systems often produce responses with a uniform timbre, which can limit the naturalness and personalization of interactions. This limitation arises from the homogeneity of timbres in training datasets and the lack of explicit speaker modeling in existing frameworks. To overcome this, recent research has focused on developing methods that allow for zero-shot timbre control, enabling dialogue systems to adapt to various speaker characteristics without retraining [38].

One notable approach is the introduction of SLAM-Omni, an end-to-end spoken dialogue system that incorporates single-stage training for timbre control. SLAM-Omni utilizes the Whisper encoder to extract audio representations from user speech, which are then aligned with text embeddings via a projector. This alignment facilitates the integration of semantic and acoustic information, allowing the system to generate responses with the desired timbre. On the output side, the system employs semantic audio tokens and text tokens to produce natural-sounding speech that matches the specified speaker characteristics. This approach not only enhances the personalization of dialogue interactions but also improves the overall user experience by making the system more adaptable to different contexts and user preferences.

Another key innovation in timbre-controllable dialogue systems is the use of speaker-decoupled semantic tokens, which enable zero-shot timbre control without the need for extensive retraining. This method leverages a Semantic Group Modeling approach to accelerate the generation of single-layer semantic speech tokens, thereby reducing computational overhead and improving model efficiency. Additionally, Historical Text Prompting is introduced to enhance multi-round history modeling in dialogue systems, ensuring that the context of previous interactions is accurately captured and reflected in the generated responses [38]. By integrating these techniques, timbre-controllable dialogue systems can achieve a higher degree of naturalness and personalization, paving the way for more engaging and effective human-machine interactions.

### 5.3.3 Literature Review on Transformer Models
The advent of transformer models has revolutionized the field of speech processing, offering unprecedented capabilities in handling sequential data and capturing long-range dependencies [37]. Since their introduction, transformers have been extensively applied to various speech processing tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR), neural speech synthesis, and spoken dialogue systems [37]. These models, characterized by their self-attention mechanisms, have demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures, particularly in tasks requiring the processing of long sequences and the integration of multi-modal data.

In the domain of ASR, transformer models have been pivotal in improving transcription accuracy, especially in noisy environments and for languages with limited training data [28]. The self-attention mechanism allows transformers to dynamically focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, reducing the impact of errors and improving robustness. Furthermore, the end-to-end nature of transformer-based ASR systems has simplified the pipeline, eliminating the need for separate acoustic and language models. This has led to more efficient and scalable solutions, capable of handling diverse and complex speech data.

For neural speech synthesis, transformers have enabled the generation of more natural and expressive speech by capturing the intricate relationships between phonemes and their corresponding acoustic features [37]. The ability to model long-term dependencies and context has significantly enhanced the quality of synthesized speech, making it more human-like and contextually appropriate. Additionally, transformer models have been integrated into spoken dialogue systems, where they have improved the coherence and relevance of responses, particularly in multi-turn conversations [39]. The versatility of transformers has also facilitated the development of end-to-end spoken dialogue models, which can directly process and generate speech, bypassing the need for intermediate text representations [6].

# 6 Future Directions


The current state of spoken dialogue systems (SDS) has seen significant advancements, but several limitations and gaps remain. One major limitation is the difficulty in handling the dynamic and context-dependent nature of spoken interactions, particularly in complex, multi-turn dialogues. Current models often struggle with accurate turn-taking, effective user modeling, and generating contextually appropriate and emotionally resonant responses. Additionally, the integration of multimodal data, while promising, remains challenging due to the complexity of aligning and fusing information from different modalities. Data scarcity is another critical issue, particularly for low-resource languages and specific user groups with unique speaking styles. These limitations highlight the need for more robust and adaptable models that can handle the rich and varied information present in real-world interactions.

To address these limitations, several directions for future research are proposed. First, the development of more sophisticated turn-taking models that can operate in a continuous and context-aware manner is essential. This involves creating models that can predict when to speak, when to listen, and how to handle interruptions and pauses, mimicking human-like turn-taking behaviors. Techniques such as the use of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and the integration of time information into large language models (LLMs) show promise in this area. Additionally, the creation of more comprehensive and publicly available datasets, especially for low-resource languages and user groups, is crucial for training and evaluating these advanced turn-taking models.

Second, the integration of multimodal data should be further explored to enhance the naturalness and effectiveness of spoken dialogue systems. This includes the development of more robust and efficient methods for aligning and fusing information from speech, text, and visual cues. Advanced multimodal models, such as those using cross-attention mechanisms within Transformer architectures, can dynamically weigh the importance of different modalities based on the current dialogue context, thereby improving the robustness of turn-taking predictions and user satisfaction. Furthermore, the use of data augmentation techniques and semi-supervised learning strategies can help generate diverse and realistic training examples, enhancing the model's ability to generalize across different scenarios.

Third, the development of more comprehensive and context-aware dialogue models is necessary to handle the rich and varied information present in real-world interactions. This involves creating models that can capture and represent user characteristics, preferences, and interaction histories more accurately. Personalized user models, which can adapt to individual user needs and preferences, are crucial for tailoring interactions and enhancing the user experience. Techniques such as continuous learning and transfer learning can be employed to improve model generalization and reduce the data requirements. Additionally, the integration of contextual knowledge, such as social relationships and conversation history, can further enhance the accuracy and naturalness of the generated responses.

The potential impact of the proposed future work is significant. By developing more sophisticated turn-taking models, integrating multimodal data, and creating more comprehensive and context-aware dialogue models, we can significantly enhance the naturalness, effectiveness, and user satisfaction of spoken dialogue systems. These advancements will make SDS more adaptable to diverse and complex interaction scenarios, thereby expanding their applications in areas such as virtual assistants, customer service chatbots, intelligent home devices, and healthcare support systems. Ultimately, these improvements will lead to more engaging, personalized, and human-like interactions, bridging the gap between human and machine communication and enhancing the overall user experience.
