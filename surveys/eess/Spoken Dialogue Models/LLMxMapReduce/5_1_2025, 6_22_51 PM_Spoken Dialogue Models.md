# 1. Introduction  

Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDSs) represent a crucial interface in human-computer interaction, enabling users to communicate with machines using natural language speech [12,25]. These systems are designed to understand user utterances, manage conversational flow, and generate appropriate responses, often with the goal of assisting users in accomplishing specific tasks or engaging in free-form conversation [5,12]. The increasing maturity of speech recognition technology and the rapid growth of practical application requirements have spurred significant interest and development in SDSs [25]. The ability of intelligent dialogue systems to efficiently handle communication, especially in scenarios like customer service or e-commerce, addresses the limitations of traditional, often inefficient and costly, artificial customer service [14]. The concept of intelligent dialogue can be traced back to early ideas such as the Turing test proposed in 1950, which posited that a system passing as human in conversation could be considered intelligent [14].  

Historically, SDSs have evolved from early systems designed for simple, specific tasks, such as providing basic information like travel details or weather forecasts [2,12]. Over time, spurred by increasing demand for more capable and user-friendly interfaces, the field has shifted towards systems capable of handling more complex applications and interacting more intelligently [2]. This evolution has seen a move away from rigid, rule-based or finite-state approaches towards more flexible and data-driven paradigms. Traditional methods often suffered from poor scalability, reliance on extensive hand-tagged data, and low training efficiency, necessitating a shift [14].  

A major paradigm shift has been driven by the rise of deep learning and advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques [18,29]. Deep learning models, particularly those based on neural networks, have demonstrated superior capabilities in processing and understanding natural language, leading to significant advancements in various components of SDSs. For instance, the application of Transformer architectures has been explored for multi-turn dialogue modeling, aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling complex, interleaved dialogue logic through mechanisms like attention [11]. Furthermore, data-driven statistical dialogue systems, particularly those based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), have become a popular topic, providing a framework for managing dialogue under uncertainty [1,2]. Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are also being actively developed for dialogue management, especially in goal-oriented settings like booking or planning tasks, allowing systems to learn optimal strategies through interaction [5].​  

The current landscape of SDS research is vibrant and increasingly interdisciplinary, drawing upon fields such as computer science, linguistics, psychology, and neuroscience [3,9,10]. Research spans core technical areas like speech recognition, natural language understanding, dialogue management, and speech synthesis, alongside broader topics such as user modeling, ethics, and system evaluation [2,9]. There is a clear trend towards developing more intelligent, diverse, portable, multimodal, and multilingual systems [2,12]. Recent efforts focus on incorporating more human-like conversational phenomena, such as generating diverse and expressive speech using diffusion models [19], or generating empathetic responses like shared laughter to improve user perception [17]. Multimodal systems that integrate information from audio, visual, and textual sources are also being explored to enhance understanding and interaction in complex environments [12,13]. The application areas of SDSs have expanded significantly, now including intelligent environments, in-car systems, personal assistants, smart homes, human-robot interaction, healthcare, education, and customer assistance [1,2,3,5,14,29].  

Despite significant progress, building truly effective and natural SDSs presents several key challenges. These include generating non-dull, non-repetitive, and engaging responses, especially in open-domain scenarios, where traditional Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) trained models may fail to account for long-term context [4]. Handling complex task execution and multi-turn dependencies remains difficult [11]. Incorporating emotional intelligence, expressivity, and subtle conversational cues like backchannels and laughter presents technical hurdles, particularly due to issues like speech recognition errors and prosody problems in situated conversation [17,19]. Effective integration and utilization of information from multiple modalities (audio, visual, text) is a core challenge in multimodal dialogue [13]. For systems  

relying on reinforcement learning, defining appropriate reward functions from limited data is a non-trivial problem, necessitating methodologies to infer rewards based on system evaluation [6,7]. Scalability, data availability (especially for specific domains or languages), and training efficiency continue to be relevant concerns [12,14].​  

This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in spoken dialogue models, highlighting key research directions, methodologies, and challenges. We review prominent paradigms, focusing particularly on the impact and application of deep learning and neural models. The scope encompasses various components and types of SDSs, examining progress towards more intelligent, natural, and versatile conversational agents. By synthesizing insights from recent literature, we aim to consolidate the current understanding of the field and identify promising avenues for future research. The remainder of this survey is structured as follows: Section \ref{section:asr} discusses Speech Recognition...  

# 2. Spoken Dialogue System Architecture  

The design of Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) fundamentally relies on distinct architectural paradigms that dictate how use input is processed and system responses are generated.  

![](images/14afe30e380f8fcadd93904d8d5c71ddd35e8de9ac37b3c13dbed79e396d6400.jpg)  

Primarily, two dominant approaches are recognized: the traditional pipeline architecture and the more recent end-to-end architecture [14].  

The pipeline architecture decomposes the SDS into a sequence of specialized, independent modules, typically including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) or Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Dialogue State Tracking (DST), Dialogue Management (DM) or Dialogue Policy (DP), Natural Language Generation (NLG), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) [2,14]. Information flows sequentially through these modules—from acoustic input to spoken output [2,14]—which offers clarity and facilitates the independent development and optimization of individual components. However, a significant drawback is the susceptibility to error propagation, where inaccuracies in an early module can adversely affect subsequent modules, potentially leading to dialogue breakdowns [14]. Furthermore, achieving optimal overall system performance through the independent tuning of modules can be challenging due to complex interdependencies, thereby limiting the system’s flexibility and adaptability to new domains or scenarios without substantial redesign [14].​  

In contrast, the end-to-end architecture aims to directly map user input (often acoustic or textual) to system output (textual or acoustic) within a single, unified model [14]. This approach bypasses explicit, hand-engineered intermediate representations and the sequential processing typical of pipeline architectures. As a result, it offers greater flexibility and the potential to learn more complex, context-dependent dialogue behaviors directly from data [14]. A key challenge for endto-end models, however, is their substantial requirement for large volumes of high-quality interaction data for training, which is often a significant hurdle, particularly in data-scarce domains [14]. Moreover, the lack of modularity complicates interpretability and debugging, as the internal decision-making processes of the system tend to remain opaque [14].  

The field has witnessed a growing interest in, and a gradual shift towards, end-to-end models. These models are pursued for their potential to overcome some of the limitations of pipeline systems—such as error propagation and difficulties in global optimization [14]—even though this shift involves a critical trade-off. Specifically, moving from a system with clear,  

interpretable modules and relatively lower data requirements per module to a black-box model that demands vast datasets but promises more fluid and contextually aware interactions is a nuanced decision [14].  

Ultimately, the choice of architecture depends heavily on factors such as data availability, computational resources, requirements for interpretability, and the desired level of flexibility and performance for specific dialogue tasks.  

# 2.1 Pipeline Architecture  

The pipeline architecture represents a prevalent structural paradigm for spoken dialogue systems, segmenting the overall system into a sequence of specialized modules that process information sequentially [14]. This structure typically includes components such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Understanding (NLU) or Semantic Language Understanding (SLU), Dialogue State Tracking (DST), Dialogue Management (DM) or Dialogue Policy (DP), Natural Language Generation (NLG), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) [2,14]. Each module performs a distinct function and interacts with its adjacent modules, facilitating a structured flow of information [14].  

The initial module, ASR, is responsible for converting the user's spoken input into text. This text is then processed by the NLU or SLU module, which aims to comprehend the user's intent and extract relevant information through tasks such as slot filling or Named Entity Recognition (NER), yielding a semantic representation of the input [2,14]. The DST module is crucial for maintaining the coherence and state of the conversation by tracking the user's history and accumulating information throughout the dialogue [14]. Based on the current dialogue state and the user's intention, the DM or DP module determines the appropriate system action or behavior, often with the objective of minimizing the number of dialogue turns in task-oriented scenarios [2,14]. Following the determination of the system's response, the NLG module converts the abstract output from the DM into natural language sentences suitable for presentation to the user [2,14]. Finally, the TTS module synthesizes this text into spoken output.  

A significant challenge within this architecture is the propagation of errors [14]. Since modules operate in sequence, an error occurring in an early stage, such as the SLU module misinterpreting user intent or failing to accurately extract slots, can cascade through the subsequent modules (DST, DM, NLG), potentially leading to an inappropriate system response or a misunderstanding that derails the dialogue [2]. The inherent ambiguity, presence of pronouns, and omissions in natural language contribute to the difficulties in achieving high precision in the SLU stage [2], exacerbating the risk of downstream errors.​  

Furthermore, the pipeline architecture presents considerable challenges in terms of holistic system optimization [14]. As each module is often developed and optimized independently, achieving optimal performance for the entire system by finetuning individual components becomes complex [14]. The interdependencies mean that an update or improvement in one module may necessitate adjustments across the entire system [14]. This modular independence also contributes to the system's inflexibility and difficulty in adapting to novel scenarios or domains without significant redesign and reoptimization of multiple components [14]. Consequently, while providing a clear separation of concerns, the pipeline structure poses hurdles for seamless end-to-end optimization and adaptability.  

# 2.2 End-to-End Architecture  

End-to-end architectures represent an alternative paradigm to traditional pipeline-based spoken dialogue systems. This approach directly maps user input to system output, aiming to model the entire dialogue process within a single framework [14].  

A primary advantage of end-to-end models is their inherent flexibility and scalability, theoretically allowing the system to adapt more fluidly to diverse user inputs and complex dialogue scenarios compared to rigidly structured pipeline components [14].  

Furthermore, these models possess the potential to learn intricate dialogue strategies directly from interaction data, bypassing the need for manually designed rules or complex state representations often required in modular systems. However, a significant drawback that currently impedes their widespread adoption, particularly in industrial settings, is the substantial requirement for large volumes of high-quality training data [14].  

This necessity presents considerable challenges regarding data efficiency and ensuring model robustness across varied and potentially unseen dialogue contexts. The heavy data dependency also makes it difficult to interpret the internal workings and decision-making processes of these models, complicating debugging and fine-tuning. Consequently, despite their  

theoretical appeal and ongoing academic exploration, end-to-end dialogue models remain largely in the research domain, with limited practical deployment to date [14].  

Current research efforts are primarily focused on improving data efficiency, enhancing interpretability, and developing techniques to improve robustness in low-resource or noisy environments.  

# 3. Core Components of Spoken Dialogue Systems  

A typical spoken dialogue system is architecturally structured into a pipeline of interconnected modules, designed to process user speech input, understand its meaning, manage the conversation flow, and generate a spoken response. The primary constituent modules include Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Dialogue State Tracking (DST), Dialogue Management (DM), Natural Language Generation (NLG), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) [1,2,5]. While ASR and TTS primarily involve signal processing and fall outside the core natural language processing focus of some studies, they form the crucial input and output layers for spoken interaction [1,2]. A separate module or integrated function is often responsible for maintaining dialogue history, essential for contextual understanding [1].​  

![](images/264fb90b94fce43ea4f708f0b27b0835c0e428c4df277c636faa85abe901685f.jpg)  

The interaction among these modules follows a general sequence. The user's speech is first processed by the ASR module to convert it into text. This text is then passed to the NLU module (often termed Spoken Language Understanding or SLU in this context [1,2]), which interprets the semantic meaning, identifying user intent and extracting relevant entities or slots [14,29]. The NLU output, along with dialogue history, is fed into the DST module, which maintains a representation of the current state of the conversation, including user goals and accumulated information [2,14]. The DM module receives the updated dialogue state from DST and determines the system's next action or strategy to move the conversation forward [1,2,14]. The chosen action is then translated into a natural language utterance by the NLG module [1,2,14]. Finally, the TTS module converts the generated text into spoken output for the user. The quality of the interpretation by NLU is particularly critical as it directly impacts the performance of downstream DST and DM modules [25].  

Significant technological advancements, particularly driven by deep learning techniques, have revolutionized each of these core components [18]. NLU has moved from traditional rule-based or statistical methods towards deep learning models and large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), which have substantially improved intent recognition and slot filling capabilities, although challenges remain in handling ambiguity and ASR errors [1,2,25,29]. DST has evolved from fixed-slot assumptions to flexible, data-driven techniques leveraging deep learning, such as sequence-to-sequence models with copy mechanisms (e.g., TRADE, Parallel Interactive Networks) and methods integrating external knowledge or addressing hierarchical structures [14,15,18]. Probabilistic methods like Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are employed in DST and DM to explicitly model the uncertainty inherent in the input processing stages and dialogue state [1,2]. Dialogue Management has seen a major shift towards data-driven approaches, especially reinforcement learning (RL) and deep reinforcement learning, for learning optimal dialogue policies, moving beyond the limitations of rigid rule-based or frame-based systems [1,2,5,14,18]. Advanced techniques like Hierarchical RL and learned reward functions are being explored to improve efficiency and performance [5,6,7]. NLG has progressed from simple template-based systems to more sophisticated neural models capable of generating diverse, contextually appropriate, and coherent responses, tackling complex scenarios like open-domain dialogue [1,2,14,15].​  

A significant challenge in this modular architecture is the potential for errors to propagate through the pipeline. Errors introduced at the ASR stage can negatively impact NLU, leading to incorrect semantic interpretations. These NLU errors, in turn, can cause inaccuracies in the dialogue state tracked by DST, misleading the DM module in its decision-making, and consequently resulting in inappropriate system responses generated by NLG. Achieving high precision and robustness in each component, especially under noisy conditions, is therefore crucial for the overall performance of the spoken dialogue system [1,2]. Different approaches exist for each module, presenting trade-offs in terms of development effort, flexibility, scalability, and performance, which researchers continually seek to optimize [1,2]. The collective progress in these individual components, largely propelled by deep learning, contributes to the development of more capable, flexible, and natural spoken dialogue systems, extending their application beyond traditional task completion to areas like empathetic interaction [17].  

# 3.1 Natural Language Understanding (NLU)  

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) constitutes a fundamental component of spoken dialogue systems, responsible for interpreting user input to extract semantic meaning. In spoken contexts, this module is often referred to as Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) [1,2]. The primary objective of NLU is to transform the user's utterance into a structured representation, typically involving identifying the user's intent and extracting relevant entities, known as slot filling [14,29]. The quality of this semantic interpretation is critical for the performance of subsequent dialogue management and response generation modules [25].

Traditional implementation approaches included syntactic analysis, statistical machine learning techniques, or hybrid methods combining both [1,2].  

Significant advancements in NLU, particularly in tasks like intent recognition and slot filling, have been driven by breakthroughs in deep learning [29]. The advent and development of large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT and GPT-3, have further revolutionized the field, offering substantial improvements in accuracy and generalization capabilities [29]. These models, pre-trained on massive text corpora, can capture complex linguistic patterns and semantic relationships, which is highly beneficial for understanding nuanced user language. Research continues to explore advanced techniques leveraging PLMs, including methods like label-aware attention networks for challenging tasks such as zero-shot multi-intent detection [15].  

Despite the progress facilitated by deep learning and PLMs, NLU for spoken dialogue systems still faces considerable challenges. A major hurdle is handling language ambiguities inherent in natural language [1,2,25]. This includes semantic ambiguities and also pragmatic complexities, such as scalar inference, where the system must infer meaning stronger than what is explicitly stated, influenced by contextual and lexical factors [28]. Furthermore, spoken input introduces challenges related to noise and potential errors from the Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) module [1,2]. Achieving high precision in SLU is difficult under these conditions [1,2]. To enhance robustness against noise and ASR errors, techniques such as relaxing grammar checks and focusing on keywords have been employed [1,2]. Leveraging dialogue history is also crucial for resolving references and improving overall understanding, especially when utterances are incomplete or contain omissions [1,2]. Recent research actively addresses these issues, exploring learning from multiple noisy augmented datasets and developing multilingual and cross-lingual approaches to enhance the adaptability and resilience of NLU systems [15]. While focused systems like those for shared laughter generation may bypass traditional semantic NLU [17], for most communicative dialogue systems, robust and accurate NLU remains an active area of research driven by the need to overcome inherent linguistic complexities and the challenges of spoken input.​  

# 3.2 Dialogue State Tracking (DST)  

Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is a crucial component in spoken dialogue systems, responsible for maintaining a representation of the user's goals, intents, and relevant information throughout the conversation. This state serves to ensure dialogue continuity by recording historical chat records and integrating information from user utterances and system responses [2,14].​  

Traditionally, DST methods often assumed fixed slots and values, which presented significant limitations in terms of scalability and adaptability to new domains or dynamic information [14]. More recent approaches have transitioned towards flexible, data-driven techniques utilizing deep learning architectures. For instance, some methods employ Bi-LSTMs to encode slot descriptions and effectively handle new, previously unseen slots, treating slot values as sequence labels [14].  

A prominent technique in contemporary DST models involves the use of copy mechanisms to generate slots and slot values directly from user utterances or system messages. The TRADE model, for example, is a copy-based dialogue state generator that decodes slot values for each potential (domain, slot) pair and utilizes a slot gate mechanism to determine relevance to the current dialogue state [18]. Other approaches, such as Parallel Interactive Networks, adopt a distinct copy strategy by copying state values separately from user utterances and system messages [18]. Furthermore, a slot connection mechanism can enhance multi-domain DST performance by leveraging existing states from other domains based on measured connections between the target slot and related domain-specific slot-value tuples [18]. These methods, particularly those based on sequence-to-sequence architectures with attention and copy mechanisms, have shown improved accuracy, especially for tracking non-enumerated slot values that are not predefined in an ontology [14].​  

The challenge of tracking dialogue states is compounded in noisy and uncertain environments, such as those involving errors in automatic speech recognition (ASR) or natural language understanding (NLU). Probabilistic approaches, like those based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), explicitly model this uncertainty. In POMDP-based dialogue systems, the belief state tracks the user's goals, intentions, and dialogue history and is updated using Bayesian inference to account for uncertainties inherent in the input processing stages [2]. While not explicitly detailing memory networks or schema-driven prompting, recent research explores methods like domain-lifelong learning and zero-shot transfer to improve robustness and adaptability to new domains and unseen entities [15].  

To address complex challenges such as handling hierarchical ontologies and integrating external knowledge, advanced models have been proposed. Some studies specifically focus on hierarchical ontology integration within generation and extraction combined DST frameworks [15]. Furthermore, integrating knowledge has led to the development of models like Knowledge-Aware Graph-Enhanced GPT-2, which leverage external graph-based knowledge to improve DST performance, potentially aiding in resolving entities and understanding complex relationships that align with hierarchical structures [15]. The treatment of multi-domain DST as a machine reading and understanding task, utilizing powerful pre-trained models like ELMO and BERT optimized on datasets such as MultiWOZ, also represents a significant step towards handling complexity and variability in dialogue states across domains [14]. These approaches collectively demonstrate the field's progression towards more robust, scalable, and knowledge-aware DST systems capable of navigating the complexities of real-world dialogue [14,18].​  

# 3.3 Dialogue Management (DM)  

Dialogue Management (DM) constitutes a central component of spoken dialogue systems, responsible for determining the system's response to user input and guiding the conversation towards a desired outcome [1,2]. The DM module selects the next system action based on the current dialogue state, which encompasses the user's intent, recognized entities, and dialogue history [1,2,14]. This may involve actions such as triggering inquiries to confirm uncertain information, querying external databases, or formulating system utterances [1,2].  

Historically, DM approaches have broadly fallen into categories including rule-based, plan-based (or frame-based), and more recently, data-driven methods, particularly those based on reinforcement learning (RL) [1,2]. Rule-based systems offer predictability and explicit control over dialogue flow, derived from expert-defined rules. However, they suffer from significant inflexibility and become difficult to scale as dialogue complexity and domain size increase, requiring substantial manual effort for development and maintenance. Frame-based approaches, often employed in task-oriented systems, structure the dialogue around filling slots within a predefined frame [14]. While suitable for well-defined tasks, they can be brittle when encountering user inputs that deviate from the expected frame structure.  

Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for dialogue policy learning, offering the potential to learn optimal dialogue strategies directly from interactions [1,14,18]. In RL-based DM, the system learns a policy that maps dialogue states to system actions to maximize a cumulative reward signal, often related to task success, dialogue efficiency, and user satisfaction. Deep reinforcement learning techniques are frequently applied to handle the high-dimensional state and action spaces encountered in complex dialogues [5].  

A critical challenge in applying RL to dialogue management is the design of an effective reward function. Recent research has explored methods for learning reward functions, which are essential for guiding the optimization of dialogue policies [6,7]. Approaches that infer rewards from expert evaluations of dialogues can facilitate online learning and enhance system performance by refining the action selection process based on the learned reward signal [6,7].​  

The trade-offs between these approaches are significant. Rule-based systems require high development effort for complex domains and lack scalability and robustness to linguistic variation. Frame-based systems are more scalable for similar tasks but remain relatively inflexible. RL-based methods, while promising for learning optimal policies and offering potentially better robustness if trained on diverse data, face challenges in exploration within large state-action spaces and are highly dependent on the quality of the reward signal. Their development typically requires substantial data and computational resources for training.​  

Advanced techniques aim to address the limitations of basic RL approaches. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), for instance, explicitly model the uncertainty inherent in understanding the user's intent and the dialogue state, leading to more robust decision-making by considering a probability distribution over states rather than a single best state estimate [1,2]. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is another advanced technique that structures the policy learning problem into different levels, learning sub-policies for specific sub-goals [5]. This allows policies to be learned at different temporal scales, which has demonstrated significant performance improvements over flat deep reinforcement learning in task-completion scenarios in both simulations and human evaluations [5]. Other advanced research explores techniques like efficient policy learning using methods such as Deep Q-networks combined with episodic memory, and collaborative multi-agent frameworks for decomposing dialogue actions [15]. Furthermore, DM can extend beyond core task completion, incorporating components like shared laughter generation in empathetic dialogue systems, which involves detecting user laughter and strategically deciding whether and how to respond with laughter [17]. This highlights the expanding scope and complexity of dialogue management beyond traditional task-oriented goals.​  

# 3.4 Natural Language Generation (NLG)  

Natural Language Generation (NLG) serves as a crucial module in spoken dialogue systems, responsible for transforming the abstract decisions or states derived from the dialogue manager into syntactically and semantically correct natural language sentences [1,2,14]. This process necessitates careful consideration of dialogue context to ensure coherence and relevance [1,2].​  

Various techniques have been employed for NLG. Historically, template-based systems have been prevalent, relying on predefined templates with fixed and variable components that are populated based on the output of the dialogue manager [1,2]. While straightforward to implement for limited domains, these systems often struggle to produce diverse and flexible responses. Alongside template-based methods, statistical approaches have also been explored for natural language production [1,2]. Another form, particularly noted in systems generating non-textual outputs like laughter, involves selecting pre-recorded utterances from a set, which can be viewed as a selection-based NLG process rather than generating novel content [17].​  

A significant challenge in NLG is ensuring that generated responses are not only grammatically correct but also diverse, coherent within the ongoing conversation, contextually appropriate, and engaging [15]. Maintaining dialogue context coherence requires techniques such as omitting previously mentioned concepts or appropriately using pronouns, often relying on information stored in a dialogue history module to avoid redundancy and maintain flow [1,2]. Generating contextually appropriate responses is particularly complex in open-domain dialogue systems, where the range of possible topics and required linguistic variations is vast [15].​  

To address these challenges and improve the quality, fluency, and diversity of generated responses, recent research has increasingly leveraged advanced neural techniques. While the provided digests do not detail specific architectures like sequence-to-sequence models or transformers, the research topics highlighted in contemporary work, such as "ConceptGuided Non-Autoregressive Generation" and "Adaptive Bridge between Training and Inference for Dialogue Generation", indicate a focus on using sophisticated models to enhance generation capabilities in complex scenarios like open-domain dialogue [15]. These advanced neural models are critical for moving beyond the limitations of template-based systems and generating more dynamic, contextually aware, and human-like text, tackling challenges related to coherence, meaning representation, and efficient generation.​  

# 4. Key Techniques and Models  

The advancement of spoken dialogue systems is critically dependent on the development and application of sophisticated techniques and model architectures. This section provides a detailed analysis of prominent approaches that have profoundly influenced the field, moving from traditional modular designs towards more integrated and data-driven paradigms.

Key techniques encompass the application of Reinforcement Learning for dialogue policy optimization, the leverage of advanced neural network architectures like Transformers for enhanced context understanding and generation, the development of End-to-End systems that unify components, and methods for integrating External Knowledge to enrich dialogue content.​  

Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful framework for training dialogue management policies, particularly in taskoriented systems, by formulating the dialogue process as a sequential decision-making problem where an agent learns to select actions to maximize cumulative reward [18]. Various RL algorithms, including Q-learning based methods like DRRN [14], Deep Q-Networks (DQN) [15], Actor-Critic methods [5], and Gaussian process-based approaches like GP-SARSA [16], have been employed. These are often integrated with deep learning architectures to handle complex states and actions [4,5,16,26]. A central challenge is the design of effective reward functions that align with desired dialogue properties, leading to research on penalizing undesirable behaviors, such as dull responses using the negative log-likelihood from a pretrained model (e.g., ​  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { r _ { 1 } = - } } \\ { { l o g } } \\ { { B i g l ( p _ { s e q 2 s e q } ( s } } \\ { { m i d p _ { i } , q _ { i } ) } } \\ { { B i g r ) } } \end{array}
$$  

where S is a set of dull responses or responses with high likelihood from an MLE model) [4,26], and learning rewards from expert feedback or evaluation [6,7]. Effective state representation, including learned representations and handling uncertainty, is also crucial [2,14,16], alongside techniques for exploration like stochastic policies, simulation, and algorithms such as BBQ Networks or GP-SARSA [4,5,16,26]. Challenges remain regarding the large action space, obtaining reliable reward signals, and high sample complexity [2,5,18].  

Transformer models have become foundational sequence-to-sequence architectures, excelling as dialogue representation models [18]. Their core strength lies in attention mechanisms, which enable selective focus on relevant parts of the dialogue history, capturing long-range dependencies and managing interleaved dialogue logic more effectively than sequential models like RNNs [11]. This capability is vital for maintaining coherence and context. Transformer encoders can be configured for various tasks, such as dual-channel encoding for semantic similarity or incremental processing integrated with external knowledge [18]. Their context understanding capabilities significantly benefit response generation.  

End-to-end dialogue systems represent a significant paradigm shift by mapping conversational history directly to responses or actions using a single framework, contrasting with traditional modular pipelines [5,17]. Architectures range from foundational seq2seq models to advanced Transformer-based systems incorporating intention reasoning and knowledge integration [4,15]. Training often involves supervised learning (e.g., MLE pre-training) combined with RL fine-tuning or endto-end RL training to overcome limitations like exposure bias and optimize for dialogue-specific metrics [4,5,16]. Pretraining on large corpora helps improve performance and generalization.​  

Integrating external knowledge is paramount for enabling dialogue systems to provide informative, grounded, and accurate responses that go beyond simple pattern matching [15]. Key techniques for knowledge integration include utilizing Knowledge Graphs (KGs) for structured information, employing methods for KG representation learning and neural retrieval [18], and implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that emphasize effective retrieval and understanding from knowledge bases, orchestrated by query understanding and potentially intelligent agents [8]. Even past dialogue turns can serve as a form of knowledge [13]. Ongoing research addresses challenges in knowledge identification, leveraging heterogeneous sources, handling unseen entities, and ensuring factual consistency [15].​  

These techniques are often combined; RL is used to train end-to-end systems or policies for Transformer models, while Transformers are fundamental architectures in modern end-to-end and knowledge-enhanced systems. Despite significant progress, shared challenges persist, including addressing the large action space in generation, obtaining reliable reward signals and evaluation metrics, managing sample complexity for efficient training, handling data annotation costs, effectively accessing and integrating diverse external knowledge, and ensuring qualities beyond task success, such as safety, explainability, grounding, personalization, adaptability, and mitigating harmful content [2,3,5,15,16,18]. Future work aims to develop more robust, data-efficient, and versatile models capable of engaging in more natural, informative, and safe interactions.​  

# 4.1 Reinforcement Learning for Dialogue Management  

Reinforcement Learning (RL) constitutes a prominent approach for training dialogue management policies, particularly in task-oriented systems [18]. The dialogue manager typically comprises modules for dialogue state tracking and policy learning, with the latter being highly amenable to RL formulations as it involves selecting dialogue actions based on the current state to maximize future rewards [18].​  

Various RL algorithms have been applied in dialogue management. Q-learning based methods, such as Deep Reinforcement Relevance Network (DRRN), treat the dialogue task as a text game [14]. DRRN approximates the Q-function by matching the current dialogue state with potential system actions through semantic similarity, encoding both state and action texts into fixed-length vectors using neural networks and interacting them (e.g., via dot product) to obtain the Q-value [14]. Deep QNetworks (DQN) have also been explored for efficient policy learning [15]. Actor-Critic methods are leveraged to enhance the efficiency of end-to-end learning for LSTM-based dialogue policies and reduce sample complexity [5]. For online policy training in continuous state spaces, Gaussian process-based approaches like GP-SARSA have been introduced, utilizing Gaussian process estimation for effective online sampling [16]. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a widely recognized framework for dialogue management under uncertainty, where RL techniques are used to find policies that maximize the expected reward over the dialogue trajectory [2]. These diverse algorithms are often integrated with deep learning architectures, such as LSTMs and RNN encoder-decoders, to handle complex dialogue states and action spaces [4,5,16,26].​  

A critical aspect of applying RL to dialogue is the design of effective reward functions, which should reflect the desired characteristics and performance of the dialogue system, with the ultimate goal of maximizing the cumulative expected reward [2,4]. Obtaining reliable reward signals, particularly from direct user feedback, poses practical challenges [2]. Consequently, significant research focuses on techniques for shaping rewards and inferring them. One approach is to penalize undesirable behaviors directly; for instance, dull or generic responses can be penalized using the negative loglikelihood of generating such responses according to a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model [4,26]. The reward  

$$
r _ { 1 } = - \log ( p _ { s e q 2 s e q } ( s \mid p _ { i } , q _ { i } ) )
$$  

for generating a response s given context $( { \mathsf { p } } \boxtimes , { \mathsf { q } } \boxtimes )$ can be formulated as above, where S is a set of dull responses [4], or more generally, high likelihood responses from an MLE-trained model are penalized to encourage diversity [26]. Another prominent direction involves learning reward functions from expert feedback or evaluation [6,7]. Methodologies have been developed to collect dialogue corpora, obtain expert performance scores, and infer a locally distributed reward function from these scores for online use, demonstrating that inferred numerical rewards can align closely with expert evaluations [6,7]. Active reward models are also employed to handle noisy user feedback and estimate task success rate and uncertainty, returning reinforcement signals to update the policy [16]. Dialogue quality can be defined by cumulative reward, with turn-level penalties or a final task success reward [16].​  

Effective state representation is crucial for RL agents in dialogue. Learned representations are common, such as fixeddimensional dialogue representations generated by RNN encoder-decoders in continuous state spaces [16], or dialogue state vectors encoded by neural networks [14]. Handling uncertainty in state is also a key consideration, addressed by frameworks like POMDPs [2] or through explicit modeling of uncertainty using techniques like Gaussian processes, which can estimate the uncertainty associated with task success [16].  

Exploration is vital for discovering optimal dialogue strategies. Techniques employed include using stochastic policies which inherently facilitate exploration during gradient-based optimization [26]. Simulating conversations between two agents is another method used to explore the vast state space [4]. Specific methods designed for efficient exploration have been introduced, such as BBQ Networks (Bayes-by-Backprop Q-Networks) [5]. GP-SARSA leverages Gaussian process estimation for effective online sampling, which guides exploration in continuous state spaces [16].  

Despite its promise, applying RL to dialogue management faces several challenges. The large action space associated with directly generating language is a significant hurdle [18], leading many RL-trained systems to focus on response selection from a limited set [18]. Combining retrieval and generation offers a potential solution [18]. Obtaining reliable reward signals, as discussed, is challenging due to the difficulty of securing consistent user feedback [2]; learning reward functions from expert data or using active reward models addresses this [6,7,16]. The sample complexity of training end-to-end dialogue policies with RL is high [5], motivating the development of more sample-efficient algorithms like efficient actor-critic methods [5]. Data annotation costs can be reduced through online learning architectures incorporating active learning mechanisms [16]. Furthermore, ensuring dialogue quality metrics beyond task success, such as reducing repetition and inconsistency, requires specific RL techniques [15]. Addressing these challenges through algorithm design, reward engineering, and efficient learning strategies remains an active area of research.​  

# 4.2 Transformer-Based Dialogue Models  

Transformer models have emerged as powerful sequence-to-sequence architectures, serving effectively as dialogue representation models [18]. Compared to recurrent neural network (RNN)-based models, Transformers possess significant advantages in processing sequential data like dialogue turns. While RNNs process input sequences uniformly, Transformer architectures, particularly through their attention mechanisms, can selectively attend to relevant parts of the dialogue history, enabling them to capture complex relationships and potentially disentangle interleaved dialogue logic [11]. This capability allows Transformers to overcome limitations inherent in sequential processing models like LSTMs, especially when dealing with long-range dependencies across numerous dialogue turns [11].  

The effectiveness of attention mechanisms is central to Transformer-based dialogue models. By allowing the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in the input sequence (representing dialogue turns or utterances), attention facilitates the capture of dependencies that span across distant parts of the conversation history. This is crucial for maintaining coherence and context in multi-turn dialogue, where relevant information may have been mentioned many turns prior. The ability to selectively focus on pertinent information also aids in managing the complexity of interleaved topics within a single dialogue session [11].  

Transformer encoders can be utilized in various configurations for dialogue modeling. A dual-channel transformer encoder, for instance, can encode user messages and candidate responses independently, allowing for the calculation of semantic similarity, potentially using simple metrics like cosine distance on learned representations derived from features such as unigrams and bigrams [18]. Furthermore, incremental transformer encoders can be designed to process turns of dialogue while also incorporating related external knowledge, such as information from supporting documents [18].​  

The strengths of Transformers in context understanding and representation modeling contribute to their advantages in generating appropriate responses. As powerful sequence-to-sequence models, their ability to manage dialogue logic and selectively attend to critical historical information provides a strong foundation for producing relevant, coherent, and contextually grounded utterances in response generation tasks [11,18]. Performance comparisons in dialogue tasks have shown Transformer-based policies performing favorably against models like LSTMs and REDP [11].  

While the provided literature highlights the architectural advantages and capabilities of Transformers for dialogue, specific challenges related to their training and deployment, such as computational resource requirements or inference latency, are not detailed. Nevertheless, potential future research directions include further exploring the integration of external knowledge sources, such as documents or databases, using architectures like incremental transformer encoders to enrich dialogue context and improve model performance [18].  

# 4.3 End-to-End Dialogue Systems  

End-to-end dialogue systems represent a significant modeling approach where a single neural network or a unified framework directly maps conversational history to a response or action, bypassing traditional modular pipelines [5]. This approach aims to simplify system design and potentially improve performance by optimizing the entire system jointly. Endto-end models have been explored in various dialogue domains, including task-oriented [5,15] and open-domain conversation generation [4].  

Diverse architectures have been employed in end-to-end dialogue systems to capture dependencies and generate coherent responses. Sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models form a foundational architecture, capable of mapping input sequences (dialogue history) to output sequences (system responses) [4]. More advanced architectures incorporate mechanisms like attention, inherently present in Transformer-based models, to better weigh the importance of different parts of the input context when generating responses [15]. Specific architectural innovations include "Intention Reasoning Networks" to explicitly model user intent and the integration of knowledge bases using Transformer architectures to enhance contextuality in task-oriented settings [15]. These architectural variations aim to improve the system's ability to understand complex dependencies and generate relevant, contextually grounded outputs.​  

Training end-to-end dialogue systems involves addressing challenges such as data scarcity and limitations of standard training techniques like Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Supervised learning, often using MLE, can be employed for initial model pre-training on large datasets [4]. However, MLE training suffers from exposure bias, where the model is only trained on ground truth prefixes during training but must generate sequences autoregressively during inference, leading to compounding errors. To mitigate limitations of standard supervised training and optimize for long-term conversational goals, reinforcement learning (RL) has been integrated [4]. RL allows training models to optimize non-differentiable dialogue metrics by learning from interactions or simulated environments. Systems like KB-InfoBot are entirely trained using RL end-to-end for information access tasks [16]. Alternatively, RL can be used for fine-tuning a model that was initially pre-trained with supervised learning [4]. This hybrid approach leverages the benefits of large-scale pre-training while using RL to align the model's behavior with dialogue-specific objectives, offering a trade-off between leveraging large datasets and optimizing conversational performance. An end-to-end learning framework specifically for task-completion neural dialogue systems highlights the application of these integrated techniques in goal-oriented settings [5]. In contrast to endto-end systems, modular approaches rely on separate components for tasks like natural language understanding, dialogue state tracking, policy management, and natural language generation [17].  

Techniques for improving performance and generalization in end-to-end systems include the aforementioned pre-training on large text corpora or dialogue datasets, which helps initialize the model with general language understanding capabilities [4]. While adversarial training was mentioned as a potential technique, its specific application details were not elaborated in the provided context. The integration of RL, either end-to-end or for fine-tuning, serves as a method to improve performance by directly optimizing dialogue outcomes rather than solely minimizing prediction error [4,16].  

In summary, end-to-end dialogue systems represent a shift towards unified modeling, employing architectures like seq2seq and Transformers, enhanced with mechanisms for intention reasoning and knowledge integration [4,15]. Training often involves a combination of supervised pre-training and reinforcement learning to overcome limitations like exposure bias and align the system with complex dialogue objectives [4]. This end-to-end paradigm, while challenging to train effectively, offers the potential for more flexible and jointly optimized dialogue agents [5,16].  

# 4.4 Knowledge-Enhanced Dialogue Models  

Integrating external knowledge into dialogue systems is crucial for enabling more informative, engaging, and accurate conversations, moving beyond simple pattern matching to grounded reasoning. However, accessing and effectively integrating diverse forms of external knowledge presents significant challenges, encompassing issues of knowledge representation, retrieval, and seamless incorporation into dialogue generation or state tracking processes. The benefits of knowledge-grounded dialogue are evident in the improved ability to handle unseen entities and ensure factual consistency, which are critical for generating high-quality responses [15].  

Various techniques have been developed to integrate external knowledge. One prominent approach utilizes Knowledge Graphs (KGs), augmenting neural networks by representing entities and relations in a low-dimensional space to facilitate the retrieval of relevant facts [18]. KG representation learning methods are broadly categorized into structure-based representations, which model entities and relations using multi-dimensional vectors, and semantically rich representation models, which incorporate additional semantic information into these embeddings [18]. For retrieving information from KGs, neural retrieval models explore directions such as distance-based matching and semantic matching [18]. Knowledgebased dialogue systems particularly benefit from the highly structured and interconnected nature of facts within KGs [18].​  

Another significant paradigm for knowledge integration is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG systems are designed to enhance the capabilities of Conversational AI and CoPilot systems by emphasizing the importance of effective retrieval and understanding, simulating aspects of human thought processes [8].  

![](images/e247e27dd6706ee9055d71ff3930debc20a7691f85c8f78456aa0ac64972790d.jpg)  

A core component of successful RAG implementation is the ability to accurately understand user queries and map them to relevant information within structured or unstructured knowledge bases [8]. The retrieved knowledge is then utilized by the generation or dialogue management component. This query understanding and knowledge mapping can be orchestrated through predefined workflows or managed dynamically by intelligent Agent modules [8]. RAG systems aim to improve response accuracy and relevance by grounding the generation in retrieved information. Beyond KGs and explicit external databases, even past dialogue turns can be treated as a specialized form of extra textual knowledge to inform future responses [13].​  

The landscape of knowledge-enhanced dialogue models includes a variety of specific research directions, such as knowledge identification in conversational systems, leveraging multi-source heterogeneous knowledge, fine-tuning models to better handle unseen entities, employing collaborative latent variable models, developing multi-stage learning frameworks for low-resource scenarios, reducing hallucinations through path grounding, evaluating factual consistency, and utilizing knowledge-aware graph-enhanced models for tasks like dialogue state tracking [15]. These studies highlight the ongoing efforts to address different facets of knowledge integration, from identification and representation to effective utilization in generation and understanding tasks, demonstrating the critical role of external knowledge in pushing the boundaries of dialogue system capabilities. While knowledge-enhanced pre-training offers potential benefits, its detailed impact, particularly concerning model size and specific knowledge types, alongside the practical challenges of maintaining large-scale knowledge bases for systems like RAG, are active areas of research and implementation effort.

Building upon foundational models and architectures, research in spoken dialogue systems (SDS) is actively exploring several advanced topics and emerging trends aimed at overcoming existing limitations and significantly enhancing system performance, versatility, and user experience. These areas represent crucial directions for pushing the boundaries of what SDS can achieve, moving towards more natural, capable, and user-centric interactions [24].  

A key trend involves improving the system's understanding and interaction with the user. User Modeling is fundamental to achieving personalization and adaptability, constructing profiles from interaction data to understand user characteristics, predict behavior, and tailor responses accordingly [1,2]. This allows for more intuitive and supportive interactions, including implicitly modeling user behavior for empathetic responses, such as shared laughter generation [17]. Complementing this, Multimodal Dialogue Systems integrate signals beyond speech, such as gestures, gaze, expressions, and visual information [1,10,12]. This integration addresses the limitations of speech-only interfaces by providing richer context, resolving ambiguities, and enhancing robustness through techniques like semantic multimodal fusion and attention mechanisms [1,13].​  

Expanding the linguistic capabilities of SDS is addressed by research in Multilingual Dialogue Systems. This area tackles the complexities of enabling interaction across multiple languages, with a particular focus on challenges for non-English and low-resource languages [3,12,21]. Key concerns include effective management of conversational context and evaluating architectural trade-offs, though specific comparative analyses are less detailed in the provided digests [21].  

Improving the expressive and emotional aspects of dialogue is paramount for more human-like interactions. Expressive and Emotion-Aware Dialogue focuses on understanding emotional states and generating empathetic and natural responses [3,15]. This includes techniques for analyzing emotional dynamics, generating empathetic text responses, incorporating elements like shared laughter, and utilizing advanced models like diffusion models to create expressive spoken output with varied tone and rhythm [17,19].​  

Addressing the challenges of data scarcity and adapting to new domains is crucial for the scalability of SDS. Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation leverage knowledge from source domains or large corpora to improve performance in target domains, reducing the need for extensive domain-specific data [3,15]. Research explores techniques like transferring knowledge from large video datasets to dialogue tasks and developing transferable architectural components such as the Transferable Dialogue State Generator (TRADE) [13,18]. Similarly, Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enhances robustness and generalization by enabling models to learn multiple related dialogue tasks simultaneously, sharing representations to  

leverage inductive biases and mitigate overfitting [14,18]. While MTL offers benefits, managing task interference remains a key challenge, addressed by techniques like attention mechanisms and dynamic task weighting [14,18].  

The complexity of modern dialogue systems is increasingly managed through integrated, modular architectures. Compound AI Systems combine multiple specialized AI modules, moving away from monolithic designs [8]. The "Agentic" approach empowers systems to autonomously determine task flows, while modularity facilitates integrating components for NLU, DST, knowledge retrieval, etc. [8]. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a significant role within these systems, enabling advanced planning, task decomposition, and information integration, although challenges related to reliability and integration persist [8].  

Finally, the scope of SDS is expanding beyond strictly task-oriented interactions to include Personal Assistants and Non-Task Oriented Systems. These systems prioritize free-form conversation, companionship, and emotional support over specific goal completion [3,17,27]. They require sophisticated models for managing open-ended conversational flow and simulating personality, with evaluation shifting towards metrics like engagement and perceived empathy [15]. These systems also raise significant ethical considerations regarding privacy, bias, and user well-being.​  

Collectively, these advanced topics and emerging trends demonstrate a clear trajectory towards developing SDS that are more intelligent, adaptive, versatile, and capable of engaging in richer, more natural human-like interactions across diverse scenarios and languages, addressing fundamental limitations of earlier systems and unlocking new possibilities for conversational AI [3,10].​  

# 5.1 User Modeling in Spoken Dialogue Systems  

User modeling constitutes a pivotal aspect in the development of sophisticated spoken dialogue systems (SDSs), playing a crucial role in enabling personalization and adaptability [1,2]. It involves the construction of profiles that capture characteristics of the user, encompassing both static attributes and dynamic states [1,2]. These profiles are typically built upon various sources of information derived from user interactions, such as voice characteristics, speech patterns, speaking state, and contextual factors [1,2]. The primary objectives of user modeling are to facilitate a deeper understanding of user dialogues and to predict future user behavior [1,2].  

Diverse types of user models are employed to achieve these objectives. Prominent techniques mentioned include emotion modeling, which seeks to understand the user's affective state; personality modeling, aimed at capturing stable user traits; and context-aware modeling, which incorporates situational information [1,2]. These models collectively contribute to enhancing the system's ability to interpret user input accurately and tailor its responses accordingly. By understanding factors such as the user's emotional state or their typical interaction style, the system can adjust its language, tone, and strategy to be more effective and appropriate.​  

Furthermore, user modeling is instrumental in predicting user actions and preferences, which allows the system to anticipate needs and guide the conversation more effectively [1,2]. For instance, in the context of generating more humanlike and empathetic responses, user behavior modeling can be utilized implicitly. One example involves detecting initial user laughter to trigger corresponding response laughter from the system, thereby modeling user behavior to create a more natural and engaging interaction [17]. This predictive capability, whether explicit or implicit, directly contributes to improving the overall user experience by making interactions feel more intuitive, personalized, and supportive. Ultimately, the integration of robust user modeling techniques enables SDSs to move beyond generic interactions toward truly adaptive and user-centric communication.​  

# 5.2 Multimodal Dialogue Systems  

Multimodal dialogue systems represent a significant advancement over traditional spoken dialogue systems, which rely solely on speech as the communication medium [12]. This research trend acknowledges that human interaction naturally incorporates various modalities beyond verbal language [1]. By integrating multiple input signals, multimodal systems aim to overcome the inherent limitations of speech-only interfaces and enhance the richness and effectiveness of the interaction [12].​  

The growing importance of this field is reflected in its prominence in recent academic venues, including calls for papers focusing on multimodal and situated dialogue systems at workshops like SemDial [10] and IWSDS [3], and its inclusion as a research direction in major conferences such as ACL [24] and EMNLP [15]. This area has also received attention from largescale research initiatives, such as the EU's Horizon2020 project focusing on language technology [1,2].  

The benefits of incorporating multiple modalities stem from their ability to provide complementary information to speech. User input can leverage not only speech but also signals such as expressions, actions, gestures, and gaze [1,2,10]. For instance, visual information can significantly aid in tasks like resolving ambiguity in spoken input. Beyond enhancing understanding, multimodal signals can also contribute to improving the robustness of core components, such as using these signals to reduce noise in speech recognition processes [2]. The goal is to enable systems to comprehend context and generate responses based on a holistic understanding derived from multimedia content and dialogue history [13].​  

A key technical challenge in multimodal dialogue systems is the effective fusion of disparate modalities. This involves combining information streams that may be asynchronous, noisy, or have different data representations. Research explores techniques for semantic multimodal fusion to address this complexity [1,2]. Attention mechanisms have emerged as a crucial tool for the selective integration of multimodal information. For example, hierarchical attention can be employed to fuse audio, visual, and textual information for multimodal dialogue understanding [13].  

Existing systems and research efforts demonstrate various approaches to multimodal dialogue. Some focus on generating textual answers grounded in multimedia content [13]. Specific architectures have been proposed, such as a multimodal Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (MHRED) which combines HRED for encoding hierarchical dialogue contexts with VGG-19 for extracting visual features, applied to tasks like ordinal and attribute-aware response generation [18]. Datasets like SIMMC2.0 have been developed to facilitate research in task-oriented immersive multimodal conversations [15]. Furthermore, studies explore diverse scenarios, including multi-modal open-domain dialogue, dialogues grounded in multiple documents, and visual dialogue tasks such as selecting GIF-based replies or reasoning about visual content [15]. These efforts underscore the breadth and depth of ongoing research aimed at building more capable and natural conversational systems by leveraging the power of multiple modalities.​  

# 5.3 Multilingual Dialogue Systems  

Building spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) capable of interacting effectively across multiple languages presents significant complexities, particularly for non-English and low-resource languages [3,21]. This area is recognized as a key research direction in natural language processing and conversational systems [3,24]. Multilingual systems are crucial for enabling interaction with users speaking different languages [12].​  

Various architectural approaches exist for constructing multilingual dialogue systems. Common paradigms include translating user input to a pivot language, developing separate models for each language, or building unified multilingual models that process multiple languages directly. Research in this domain often focuses on improving core components like cross-lingual spoken language understanding and intent detection [15]. While these studies highlight critical areas for advancement, the provided digests do not offer detailed comparative analyses regarding the accuracy, efficiency, or scalability trade-offs between these distinct architectural approaches.​  

A key challenge in developing efficient multilingual dialogue systems lies in processing conversational context effectively without excessive computational overhead. One investigation explores strategies for reducing the amount of natural language encoding required at each dialogue turn in multilingual task-oriented systems [21]. A central parameter in this strategy is the number of preceding turns (denoted by $H$ ) fed to the model as dialogue history [21]. The research delves into identifying the point at which increasing $H$ yields diminishing returns on performance [21]. Furthermore, it categorizes specific instances where models utilizing a small history window (low $H$ ) exhibit errors and analyzes the inherent limitations of such approaches [21]. This highlights the critical impact of effectively managing dialogue history on system performance and efficiency in multilingual contexts.​  

Transfer learning from high-resource languages is a promising technique to enhance performance in low-resource settings, although specific instances are not detailed in the provided digests. The concept of applying frameworks developed in one language (e.g., Japanese) to others suggests potential for generalizability across linguistic boundaries [17]. Addressing the unique challenges faced by speakers of non-English and low-resource languages remains a significant driver for research in multilingual dialogue systems [21].  

# 5.4 Expressive and Emotion-Aware Dialogue  

Developing spoken dialogue systems (SDS) capable of understanding and generating emotional content is crucial for creating engaging, empathetic, and natural interactions [3,15]. Research in this area focuses on incorporating emotional intelligence to improve user experience, particularly in applications like emotional support systems [3]. Key aspects include understanding emotional dynamics in conversations and generating appropriate, empathetic responses [15].  

Generating empathetic responses is a significant challenge. Studies explore various approaches, such as analyzing emotional dynamics within conversations [15] and specifically tailoring generated responses to match emotional states [17]. One specific technique involves incorporating laughter into the dialogue, leveraging its role in expressing mirth and fostering social connection [3,17]. Shared laughter generation, for instance, involves selecting between mirthful and social laugh types to align with the user's perceived emotional state, thereby enhancing the perceived empathy of the system [17]. The use of humor and metaphors in dialogue systems, which often involves expressive vocalizations like laughter, is an active area of investigation [3].​  

Beyond textual content, the expressiveness and naturalness of the spoken output are vital for conveying emotion. Traditional AI voice systems often suffer from monotonous delivery, lacking the emotional depth characteristic of human speech [19]. Recent advancements utilize diffusion models to address this limitation. Diffusion models are employed to generate diverse and expressive speech, enabling AI voices to convey different emotions and intentions through variations in tone, pitch, and rhythm [19]. This enhances the overall naturalness and emotional richness of the spoken dialogue output.  

While research explores techniques for generating empathetic text and expressive speech, the challenge of robust emotion detection from potentially noisy or ambiguous multimodal data remains complex. Furthermore, incorporating broader concepts such as AI-based consciousness or awareness and addressing the associated profound ethical considerations are subjects extending beyond the current technical focus presented in these specific studies. Instead, the immediate research emphasizes specific technical approaches like empathetic response generation through dialogue structures and laughter, alongside improvements in speech expressiveness via models like diffusion models [15,17,19].​  

# 5.5 Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation  

Transfer learning and domain adaptation represent crucial areas of research in developing robust and data-efficient spoken dialogue models, particularly for enabling systems to operate effectively in new environments or for novel tasks without requiring extensive domain-specific labeled data. The application of these techniques significantly enhances the generalization ability of dialogue systems and addresses the challenge of data sparsity often encountered when expanding to new domains. This is a widely recognized topic, actively explored in various research venues, including dedicated conference themes [3,15].​  

Research in this domain focuses on strategies to leverage knowledge acquired from source domains or large general corpora to improve performance in target domains. One approach involves the transfer of models and data from extensive background corpora to specialized tasks. For instance, studies have investigated transferring knowledge embedded in models trained on large collections of how-to videos to enhance performance on tasks like Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialogue (AVSD), demonstrating the potential for cross-modal and cross-domain knowledge transfer [13].​  

Beyond transferring from general sources, efforts are directed towards developing architectural components that are inherently more transferable across different dialogue domains. A notable example is the Transferable Dialogue State Generator (TRADE), which functions as a copy-based mechanism [18]. This model is designed to decode slot values for potential (domain, slot) pairs and employs a slot gate to determine which pairs are relevant to the current dialogue state. This architecture facilitates adaptation by allowing the model to process information relevant to various domains and their associated slots, making it a more flexible component for deployment across different task-oriented dialogue scenarios [18]. These studies, along with others focusing on transferable and continual learning approaches, underscore the ongoing advancements in enabling dialogue systems to adapt to new domains and learn incrementally [15]. Addressing the challenges of domain shift and developing effective adaptation techniques remain central themes in advancing the practicality and scalability of spoken dialogue systems.​  

# 5.6 Multi-Task Learning  

Multi-task learning (MTL) represents a significant paradigm in enhancing the performance and efficiency of neural models for dialogue systems by enabling models to learn multiple related tasks simultaneously [14,18]. A core benefit of MTL lies in its ability to improve model robustness and generalization capabilities. By sharing representations across different tasks— such as intent detection, slot filling, dialogue state tracking, and response generation—the model can leverage the inductive bias provided by related tasks, leading to better performance, especially in data-scarce scenarios or when faced with novel inputs [18]. This shared learning mechanism helps in preventing overfitting on individual tasks and allows the model to capture more general and useful features of the input data [14]. The shared layers or parameters act as a form of regularization, encouraging the model to learn representations that are relevant and beneficial across diverse dialogue subproblems.​  

Despite its advantages, MTL in dialogue systems presents notable challenges, particularly concerning task interference. When multiple tasks are learned concurrently, optimizing for one task might negatively impact the performance on another, especially if the tasks are not sufficiently related or if their optimal parameter spaces diverge significantly [14]. This interference can hinder the overall learning process and limit the benefits of shared representations. Techniques for balancing the learning signals from different tasks are crucial to mitigate this issue. One prominent approach involves employing attention mechanisms [18]. Attention mechanisms can dynamically weight the contribution of shared or taskspecific layers based on the input or the specific task, allowing the model to selectively focus on the most relevant features or computations for each task. Other techniques include using task-specific layers, dynamic task weighting strategies during training, or implementing optimization methods that specifically address potential task conflicts [14,18]. Effectively managing task interference is key to successfully applying MTL for building more robust, generalizable, and efficient dialogue systems.​  

# 5.7 Compound AI Systems for Spoken Dialogue  

The development of sophisticated spoken dialogue systems increasingly leverages Compound AI Systems, which integrate multiple specialized AI modules to achieve complex capabilities [8]. These architectures move beyond monolithic models towards modular designs, offering enhanced flexibility and the potential for more robust performance across diverse dialogue scenarios. Compound AI Systems are broadly categorized into several types relevant to dialogue processing, including RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, Conversational AI systems, Multi-Agent systems, and CoPilot systems [8]. Understanding the working principles and module interactions within these categories is crucial for designing advanced dialogue interfaces.​  

A fundamental concept underlying the deployment of these systems is the "Agentic" approach [8]. This paradigm endows AI systems with the ability to autonomously determine and execute task flows based on user input and internal state, enabling more dynamic and less pre-scripted interactions. Modularity in system design facilitates the integration of specialized components, allowing different modules to handle specific aspects of the dialogue process, such as natural language understanding, dialogue state tracking, knowledge retrieval, and response generation. For instance, Conversational AI systems often manage dialogue flow and user intent, while RAG systems specialize in retrieving relevant information to ground responses. The deployment of specific architectures like CoPilot systems, designed to assist users in complex tasks, necessitates a thorough understanding of the human work environment to ensure seamless and effective collaboration [8].  

Large Language Models (LLMs) play a significant role in empowering autonomous agents within Compound AI Systems for dialogue [8]. They can facilitate sophisticated planning and execution by enabling capabilities such as task decomposition, where complex goals are broken down into manageable sub-tasks [8]. LLMs can also assist in multi-plan selection, evaluating various potential action sequences to identify the most suitable one for a given context [8]. Furthermore, LLMs can aid planning by integrating information from external modules or knowledge sources, allowing agents to incorporate real-world data or leverage specialized tools [8]. Techniques like reflection and refinement enable agents to evaluate their own outputs or plans and iteratively improve them [8]. Memory augmentation allows agents to maintain context and recall past interactions or information, which is critical for coherent and personalized long-term dialogues [8]. While these LLMbased techniques enhance agent capabilities, the inherent limitations of LLMs, such as the potential for generating inaccurate or irrelevant information, alongside challenges in integrating external modules and ensuring reliable plan execution, highlight the ongoing need for robust engineering design to ensure reliability, scalability, and safety in deployed dialogue systems. Multi-Agent Systems, which involve multiple interacting agents, hold promise for handling complex, collaborative dialogue scenarios, though their design and coordination present significant challenges. Comparing systems like Conversational AI, focused on natural conversation flow, with CoPilot systems, aimed at task completion support, reveals distinct requirements for memory management and challenges in generating natural yet task-effective responses. Rule-based approaches combined with reinforcement learning techniques have also been explored for dialogue management, utilizing hierarchical structures for task decomposition and optimizing policies through interaction with simulators, demonstrating the diversity of approaches in managing dialogue complexity [14].  

# 5.8 Personal Assistants and Non-Task Oriented Systems  

Personal assistants and non-task-oriented conversational systems represent a significant category within spoken dialogue models, distinct from their task-oriented counterparts [27]. Unlike systems designed to achieve specific user goals such as booking a flight or providing information, these systems prioritize engaging in free-form conversation, providing companionship, or offering support, often with an emphasis on empathy and emotional understanding [3,17].  

The primary goal of non-task-oriented systems is to maintain engaging, coherent, and natural dialogue, fostering user interaction and potentially building rapport. This contrasts sharply with the task-oriented goal of efficiently and accurately completing a predefined task. Architecturally, while task-oriented systems heavily rely on components like Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for slot filling and intent recognition, Dialogue State Tracking (DST) to manage task progress, and Dialogue Policy for action selection toward task completion, non-task-oriented systems often require sophisticated models for managing conversational flow, generating diverse and contextually appropriate responses, maintaining a persona, and handling open-ended topics. Techniques like contextualized dialogue management are crucial for ensuring coherence and relevance across turns in such open-domain conversations [15]. Research explores methods to enhance interaction quality, such as implementing attentive listening systems that generate listener responses, like backchannels, to elicit user conversation by demonstrating understanding and empathy [17]. The domain specifically encourages work on companions and personal assistants capable of emotional dialogue [3].​  

The challenges inherent in non-task-oriented systems include maintaining long-term conversational coherence without a defined end goal, handling the vast variability of human language and topics, generating creative and engaging responses, and simulating personality and emotional intelligence. Opportunities lie in their potential to serve as interactive companions, educational tools, or interfaces for information access beyond structured queries, offering personalized and empathetic interactions [17]. Evaluating these systems is also distinct; metrics shift from task success rate and efficiency to measures of engagement, naturalness, user satisfaction, perceived empathy, and coherence, often requiring subjective human evaluation. Examples of research in this area include the development of socialbots like Athena 2.0, which focus on contextualized dialogue management within a social conversational framework [15].  

Furthermore, personal assistants and non-task-oriented systems raise significant ethical considerations. The collection and processing of extensive user data from free-ranging conversations pose substantial privacy risks. The potential for users to form emotional attachments or dependencies on companion systems necessitates careful consideration of system design to avoid manipulation or psychological harm. Issues of bias in training data can lead to unfair or harmful responses. Transparency regarding the system's nature (i.e., being a bot) is crucial to manage user expectations and trust. Ensuring the system operates safely and responsibly, particularly when interacting with vulnerable users, is paramount.

Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDSs) are finding increasingly diverse applications across a multitude of domains, reflecting their growing maturity and potential impact [1,12]. Many early and prominent applications are centered around task completion, enabling users to achieve specific objectives such as obtaining travel information, making reservations, checking weather forecasts, querying directory information, ordering products, and conducting banking transactions [1,2,5,12]. These systems are also utilized in specific professional contexts like conference collaboration [1,2]. The broad utility of these technologies aligns with general trends in speech and spoken language processing research and the wider field of NLP applications [9,24].  

Customer service represents a significant application area for intelligent dialogue systems [14,15,20]. Deployed as chatbots or customer service robots, these systems offer a means to improve efficiency and reduce the costs associated with manual support [20]. The importance of this domain is underscored by dedicated research efforts, including the creation of specialized datasets for tasks like dialogue summarization in customer service contexts [3,15].​  

The healthcare sector offers compelling applications for SDSs, albeit with particular requirements and ethical considerations. These systems can assist with medical consultations, facilitate chronic disease monitoring, provide prescription support and dietary guidance, aid in smoking cessation, and support medical diagnosis, including the detection of specific diseases [2,29]. Dialogue-based diagnostic tools are especially valuable for individuals unable to attend in-person appointments [1]. A primary challenge in healthcare applications is the stringent requirement for privacy and secure handling of sensitive patient data [1], making this domain a key area of interest for conversational systems [3].  

SDSs are also frequently incorporated into embodied agents and conversational robots [1,14,17], such as COLLAGEN, AVATALK, COMIC, and NICE [2]. A crucial requirement for these agents is the ability to foster user engagement and interact naturally. Research explores techniques like shared laughter generation to enhance the perceived empathy of these systems [17], supporting their deployment in various markets, including robot assistants [14].​  

Conversational AI also shows significant promise in supporting child development and educational settings [3,29]. Applications target areas such as aiding self-learning processes and contributing to research on brain function [29]. The use of technologies like text-to-video AI integrated with dialogue systems can enhance therapeutic play experiences for children [29]. The study of child-adult interaction dynamics within dialogue frameworks is also a relevant area of inquiry [10].  

Beyond these prominent domains, SDSs are applicable to specialized multimedia tasks like video question answering (VQA) and Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialogue (AVSD), often leveraging advanced techniques such as transfer learning [13]. The fundamental research area of designing and evaluating dialogue systems underscores the ongoing focus on improving their practical performance across all applications [10].  

The expansion of SDS applications necessitates continuous improvement in system robustness and adaptability. For taskoriented systems, data augmentation techniques, specifically TOD-DA, are investigated to enhance resilience against realworld variations [21]. These methods simulate factors like diverse oral styles and errors introduced by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to improve model performance [21]. Analysis of these approaches focuses on their effectiveness, design principles, and resulting performance gains [21].​  

Developing effective multilingual task-oriented systems presents particular challenges, especially concerning low-resource languages [21]. Strategies aim to minimize the need for extensive language-specific resources and optimize natural language encoding processes [21]. Research evaluates the trade-offs between computational efficiency and performance in multilingual settings and examines how dialogue history impacts system efficacy across languages [21].​  

In summary, the landscape of spoken dialogue system applications is broad and continues to expand, offering significant potential across diverse sectors while driving focused research on domain-specific requirements, technical challenges related to robustness and multilingualism, and critical ethical considerations such as data privacy [1].  

# 7. Evaluation of Spoken Dialogue Systems  

Rigorous evaluation is paramount in the development of spoken dialogue systems (SDS), encompassing assessment for speech-based, multilingual, and multimodal interactions [9,12]. It is recognized as a significant research area [3,10,24]. However, achieving comprehensive and reliable evaluation presents notable challenges, including the inherent difficulty in simulating the complexity of real user interactions and the lack of fully reliable automatic metrics capable of capturing the nuances of human conversation.  

Automatic evaluation metrics offer objectivity and efficiency. For evaluating specific modules or aspects, metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score are employed, such as in assessing laughter detection [17]. However, traditional metrics like  

BLEU and perplexity have documented limitations in adequately assessing the quality of dialogue, particularly in terms of long-term coherence and user engagement [4]. They struggle to reliably measure the appropriateness and naturalness of system responses in complex conversational contexts. To address the challenge of automatically evaluating dialogue coherence, advanced metrics like GRADE (GRaph-enhanced Automatic Dialogue Evaluation) have been introduced for opendomain systems, utilizing graph representations of dialogue context [18]. Despite these advancements, developing automatic metrics that fully align with human judgment of dialogue quality remains an active research frontier.​  

Complementary to automatic methods, human evaluation is crucial for assessing user experience and capturing subjective dialogue qualities that are difficult for automated metrics to quantify [7]. This typically involves human experts or users providing subjective scores for attributes such as empathy, naturalness, human likeness, and understanding, often using multi-point scales [17]. The insights derived from human evaluations can be invaluable for understanding user perception and can even be used to infer or train reward functions for dialogue management optimization [6,7]. While effective for subjective nuances, challenges like ensuring inter-annotator agreement and mitigating bias require careful consideration. Evaluation methodologies often combine approaches, utilizing both automatic and human assessments [13], sometimes alongside simulation-based evaluations, particularly for task-completion systems [5].  

There is a significant need to incorporate direct user feedback and develop novel metrics that focus on qualities critical for end-to-end systems, such as coherence, engagement, and overall satisfaction. The development of robust evaluation methods is an ongoing area of focus, as highlighted by collections of research in the field [15].  

The performance and evaluation of SDS are also heavily reliant on the availability and characteristics of datasets. Publicly available datasets vary widely in type and suitability. Task-oriented datasets like MultiWOZ provide structured interactions beneficial for dialogue state tracking and management in constrained domains [14], but their focus can limit naturalness. Specialized datasets, such as SIMMC2.0 for multimodal interactions, MultiDoc2Dial for document grounding, CSDS and TWEETSUMM for summarization, and TIAGE for topic-shift modeling, cater to specific phenomena and domains [15]. Large open-domain corpora like OpenSubtitles offer scale for training generative models but often lack annotations and contain noise [4]. Custom-collected datasets, though highly relevant to specific research questions (e.g., for reward function learning or generating shared laughter), often suffer from limited size and availability [6,7,17]. Evaluation platforms for spoken language systems, like SpeechColab, highlight the need for data that includes aligned audio and text and accounts for ASR errors [9]. Despite the diverse datasets available, there remains a critical need for large-scale, high-quality corpora with comprehensive annotations, greater diversity across demographics and contexts, and data specifically designed to capture complex phenomena like errors, multimodal cues, and nuanced emotional states [3]. Standardized collection and evaluation methodologies for these datasets are essential for advancing the field.​  

# 7.1 Automatic Evaluation Metrics  

Automatic evaluation metrics are commonly employed in the assessment of spoken dialogue systems due to their inherent objectivity and efficiency, providing quantitative and reproducible scores. For specific tasks or modules within a dialogue system, metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score are utilized—for instance, in the evaluation of a laughter detection module [17]. However, a significant limitation of many traditional automatic metrics, such as BLEU and perplexity, is their documented inadequacy in fully capturing the multifaceted aspects of dialogue quality, particularly long-term coherence and user engagement [4]. This deficiency highlights their inability to reliably assess the appropriateness and naturalness of system responses in a complex conversational context.​  

To address the challenge of evaluating dialogue coherence automatically, more advanced metrics have been proposed. An example is GRADE (GRaph-enhanced Automatic Dialogue Evaluation), an automatic graph-enhanced coherence metric specifically designed for open-domain dialogue systems [18]. GRADE operates by combining utterance-level context representation and topic-level graph representation. It constructs a dialogue graph based on encoded context–response pairs, infers the graph to obtain topic-level representations, and computes a final score by processing the concatenated vector of context and graph representations through a feedforward network [18].  

While metrics like GRADE represent progress towards more sophisticated automatic evaluation, the development of metrics that accurately and comprehensively reflect human judgment of dialogue quality, coherence, and appropriateness remains an active area of research.  

# 7.2 Human Evaluation Methods  

Human evaluation plays a crucial role in assessing the performance and quality of spoken dialogue models by providing valuable insights into user experience and system effectiveness. This methodology typically involves human experts or users evaluating the dialogue system’s output or overall interaction quality and assigning numerical scores [6,7]. This approach is particularly valuable for capturing subjective dialogue qualities that are difficult to quantify with automated metrics [7]. For instance, subjective evaluations may utilize multi-point scales, such as a 7-point scale, to measure nuanced attributes like empathy, naturalness, human likeness, and understanding [17]. A key advantage of this approach is its ability to uncover these subjective aspects, offering a deeper understanding of how users perceive dialogue quality [7,17]. The numerical scores obtained from human evaluators can be subsequently used for various purposes, including inferring or training reward functions to optimize dialogue management and system performance [6,7]. While capturing subjective nuances is a significant strength, the primary focus of the provided information is on the application and benefits of this method in assessing subtle dialogue qualities and its utility in downstream tasks such as reward function learning.  

# 7.3 Datasets for Dialogue Systems  

The performance and capabilities of spoken dialogue models are critically dependent on the datasets used for training, validation, and evaluation. Various datasets have been developed to address different aspects and challenges within the field, each possessing distinct characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses for specific research tasks.  

Publicly available datasets for task-oriented dialogue systems, such as WOZ (Wizard of Oz), DSTC2, DSTC3, and MultiWOZ, have been instrumental in advancing research in areas like dialogue state tracking and dialogue management within constrained domains [14]. MultiWOZ, in particular, offers a large-scale, multi-domain environment for evaluating task completion models. While these datasets provide structured interactions and clear goals, their primary focus on specific tasks and limited domains can restrict the naturalness and diversity of linguistic phenomena observed, posing challenges for generalization to open-domain scenarios or novel tasks.  

The landscape of dialogue datasets is expanding to cover more complex interactions and domains, as highlighted by several corpora presented in recent literature [15]. Datasets like SIMMC2.0 address the growing need for multimodal interactions, providing a task-oriented framework grounded in immersive environments, which is crucial for developing systems that integrate visual information with dialogue. MultiDoc2Dial focuses on dialogues requiring grounding in multiple documents, supporting research in information-seeking conversations and document-based question answering. For specialized tasks like dialogue summarization, datasets such as CSDS (for Chinese customer service) and TWEETSUMM (for customer service tweets) provide domain-specific data, enabling the development of tailored summarization models. Furthermore, TIAGE serves as a benchmark specifically designed for topic-shift aware dialogue modeling, addressing the complexity of conversations that evolve across multiple subjects. Corpora built for studying clarifying questions contribute to understanding and modeling ambiguity resolution in open-domain contexts [15]. These specialized datasets are valuable for targeting specific dialogue phenomena or domains, but their narrow focus may limit their applicability to broader dialogue research.​  

Open-domain dialogue datasets, exemplified by large corpora like OpenSubtitles, offer vast amounts of naturally occurring conversational text [4]. The scale of such datasets can be advantageous for training large language models capable of generating diverse responses. However, these corpora typically lack explicit dialogue act annotations, state information, or task-specific labels, making them less suitable for supervised training of task-oriented components. Furthermore, the uncurated nature of naturally occurring data can include noise, irrelevant content, or repetitive patterns (e.g., frequent "I don't know" responses, which may necessitate data augmentation [4]), impacting the quality and efficiency of model training.​  

Beyond general-purpose or task-oriented corpora, some research relies on custom-collected datasets tailored to specific systems or phenomena. Examples include online-collected dialogue corpora evaluated by experts for reward function learning in dialogue management [6,7], or a speed-dating dialogue corpus used for generating shared laughter in empathetic interactions with an android [17]. While these datasets offer high relevance to the specific research question and potentially capture nuanced interactions, their limited size, lack of public availability, and specific collection methodologies can hinder reproducibility and broader research contributions. The connection between datasets and automatic speech recognition (ASR) evaluation platforms like SpeechColab also underscores the unique data requirements for spoken dialogue systems, which necessitate aligned audio and text, and evaluation metrics that account for ASR errors [9].  

Despite the progress in dataset development, significant areas for improvement remain. The need for large-scale, highquality dialogue corpora with comprehensive annotation, labeling, and standardized evaluation protocols is paramount [3]. Enhancing dataset diversity to cover a wider range of demographics, linguistic styles, cultural contexts, and interaction scenarios is crucial for building robust and unbiased dialogue systems. Furthermore, there is a continuous need for datasets specifically designed to capture complex and less common phenomena, such as errors and repairs, multimodal cues beyond text, varying levels of emotional intensity, and complex reasoning within dialogue, often requiring detailed manual annotation and expert evaluation. The development of such datasets, coupled with standardized methodologies for collection and evaluation, is essential for driving future advancements in spoken dialogue models.​  

# 8. Challenges and Future Directions

Despite significant advancements, the development of robust, scalable, and human-like spoken dialogue systems (SDS) faces numerous persistent challenges. Addressing these limitations is crucial for the widespread deployment and acceptance of these technologies across diverse domains. Key areas requiring continued research and innovation include tackling data scarcity, enhancing generalization capabilities, improving system scalability and robustness, achieving more natural and human-like interaction, and navigating complex ethical considerations [2,3,14,19].​  

A fundamental challenge lies in addressing data scarcity and generalization. Developing models that perform effectively with limited labeled data remains difficult, particularly for specialized domains, specific dialogue phenomena like shared laughter, or tasks requiring multimodal understanding such as Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialogue (AVSD) [13,14,17]. Current efforts to mitigate this involve improving data utilization and collection strategies, including automatic tagging and efficient dialogue structure mining [14]. Transfer learning from resource-rich datasets, few-shot learning techniques, and self-training methods are actively being explored and applied to enhance model performance and generalization in datascarce settings [13,15].​  

Improving scalability and robustness is another critical hurdle. Systems must effectively handle increasing complexity arising from diverse user intents, slot values, and system actions across various domains [14]. Solutions proposed for scalability include leveraging semantic similarity matching, knowledge distillation, and sequence generation techniques [14]. Robustness is particularly challenged by inherent inaccuracies in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and environmental noise, necessitating effective strategies to mitigate these errors [1,2]. Furthermore, handling complex language, including non-literal or figurative expressions, and ensuring consistent performance across different domains are ongoing challenges [15]. Techniques like dialogue rewriting are being investigated to enhance domain robustness [15]. Challenges also exist in efficiently modeling user replies in user simulators for training and generalizing models like POMDPs to practical systems [2].​  

Striving towards more human-like interactions represents a key evolutionary goal. This requires systems capable of understanding and expressing emotional nuances, generating diverse and creative responses beyond dull or repetitive outputs, engaging in sophisticated pragmatic reasoning, and handling complex multi-turn conversational context [4,11,15]. Incorporating emotional intelligence involves generating emotionally expressive speech, potentially via diffusion models, and integrating non-verbal cues like shared laughter [17,19]. Pragmatic understanding necessitates integrating non-verbal signals like gesture and gaze [10]. Advanced machine learning techniques, including generative models, reinforcement  

learning, and human-in-the-loop training, are instrumental in pursuing these goals, though challenges remain in areas like defining reliable reward functions for complex conversational goals [2,6,7,14].  

Ethical considerations are increasingly recognized as paramount [3,5,29]. The field must address potential biases, privacy concerns, fairness, risks, and harms associated with SDS [3,5,29]. A specific challenge involves mitigating the generation of offensive or harmful content by dialogue models [3,15]. Ensuring safety and explainability, particularly for systems powered by large language models, is a critical area of focus [3].  

Looking ahead, promising future directions and emerging trends include continuing to refine models for greater emotional nuance and incorporating richer multimodal features like linguistic and video data [17,19]. Developing better user simulators and creating systems usable by non-experts are important for practical deployment [2]. Research is also progressing on building more intelligent, diverse, portable, and multi-modal systems, exploring sophisticated architectures and attention mechanisms for complex dialogues [1,11]. The potential impact of emerging technologies on personalization and explainable AI for SDS is significant, offering avenues for systems that are not only effective but also transparent and tailored to individual users [3]. Continued research into core areas like semantic/pragmatic interpretation and dialogue management remains vital for building truly robust and versatile SDS [10].​  

# 8.1 Addressing Data Scarcity and Generalization  

Data scarcity and the consequent challenges in generalization represent significant impediments to the development of robust spoken dialogue systems. Insufficient labeled data is a pervasive issue, particularly in specialized domains or for specific dialogue phenomena, such as the generation of shared laughter in empathetic interactions [17]. Similarly, tasks like Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialogue (AVSD) face data scarcity, limiting model performance [13]. Effective dialogue systems necessitate the ability to perform well even with limited domain-specific data and to generalize across different tasks and user interactions [14].​  

Researchers have explored various strategies to mitigate the impact of data scarcity and enhance generalization capabilities. One approach involves improving data utilization and collection methodologies. This includes techniques like automatic machine tagging, effective dialogue structure mining to derive more insights from existing data, and optimizing data collection strategies [14]. These methods aim to either reduce the burden of manual annotation or extract maximal value from available datasets.  

Transfer learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for leveraging knowledge from resource-rich domains or tasks to improve performance in resource-scarce settings. For instance, transfer learning from a large corpus of how-to videos has been successfully applied to address data scarcity in the AVSD task [13]. This demonstrates the potential of pre-training on extensive, related datasets to provide a strong foundation for fine-tuning on smaller, task-specific datasets.​  

Furthermore, advancements in few-shot learning and self-training techniques are directly addressing the challenge of limited labeled data. Few-shot learning specifically focuses on enabling models to learn effectively from only a few examples per class or task. Studies referenced in the literature, such as "Self-training Improves Pre-training for Few-shot Learning in Task-oriented Dialog Systems" and "An Explicit-Joint and Supervised-Contrastive Learning Framework for FewShot Intent Classification and Slot Filling", highlight efforts in this direction [15]. Self-training, a semi-supervised method, allows models to iteratively learn from unlabeled data, thereby expanding the effective training set without requiring extensive manual annotation. These techniques contribute to reducing the reliance on large volumes of task-specific labeled data and improving the generalization capabilities of dialogue models across diverse scenarios.​  

# 8.2 Improving Scalability and Robustness  

Developing spoken dialogue systems that are both scalable to handle wide-ranging inputs and domains, and robust to various sources of errors, remains a critical challenge. Achieving scalability requires systems to effectively manage increasing complexity arising from diverse user intents, slot values, and required system actions [14]. Approaches proposed to address poor scalability include leveraging semantic similarity matching, knowledge distillation, and sequence generation techniques to handle variations and adapt to new requirements [14]. These methods facilitate managing complexity and enable systems to cope with expanded user needs and domain variations.​  

Concurrently, ensuring robustness is vital for reliable performance in real-world conditions. A primary source of errors in spoken dialogue systems stems from inherent inaccuracies in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and environmental noise [2,15]. Effective strategies for dealing with speech recognition errors and noise are thus crucial for improving overall system robustness [2]. Furthermore, robustness is challenged by the complexities of natural language itself, including the need for models to reliably interpret non-literal or figurative language constructs [15]. The ability to perform consistently well across different domains is also a key aspect linking scalability and robustness; research explores methods like dialogue rewriting— such as RAST (Domain-Robust Dialogue Rewriting as Sequence Tagging)—to enhance domain robustness [15].​  

Collectively, these efforts to adaptively handle diverse inputs and system actions for scalability, while mitigating a variety o error sources for robustness, are fundamental to deploying practical and effective spoken dialogue systems.  

# 8.3 Towards More Human-Like Interactions  

Achieving human-like interactions represents a key objective in the evolution of spoken dialogue systems, moving beyond task completion towards more natural, engaging, and sophisticated communication. This requires systems capable of understanding and responding to emotional nuances, generating diverse and creative outputs, and employing sophisticated pragmatic reasoning [15]. These elements are crucial for systems to effectively participate in open-domain conversations and build rapport with users [15,17].  

Incorporating emotional intelligence into dialogue systems involves both recognizing user emotion and expressing appropriate affect in system responses. Significant progress is being made in generating speech with emotional expression, for instance, through the application of diffusion models. Techniques like DiffCSS demonstrate the potential of diffusion models to endow AI dialogue speech with greater expressiveness, contributing to more natural and engaging interactions [19]. Beyond vocal tone, incorporating non-verbal cues and social signals is vital. Research explores generating specific interaction behaviors like shared laughter in empathetic dialogue, highlighting how systems can participate in nuanced social exchanges crucial for human conversation [17].​  

Generating diverse and creative output is another facet of human-like interaction, particularly important in open-domain dialogue where the range of possible topics and responses is vast [15]. Developing effective strategies and proxy indicators for evaluating the quality of open-domain dialogues is an active area of research aimed at assessing how well systems mimic human conversational richness [15].  

Furthermore, human communication heavily relies on pragmatic reasoning – the ability to understand meaning in context, including implicit information, intent, and the role of non-verbal communication. In spoken dialogue, pragmatic meaning is conveyed not only through words but also through elements like gesture, gaze, and intonational meaning [10]. Integrating the understanding and generation of such non-verbal cues is essential for systems to engage in pragmatically-aware conversations [10].​  

Advancements in machine learning techniques are instrumental in pursuing these goals. As noted, diffusion models show promise for generating emotionally expressive speech [19]. More broadly, generative models are fundamental to producing diverse and creative textual and spoken outputs. While not explicitly detailed in the digests, advanced techniques like Reinforcement Learning (RL) are commonly employed in dialogue management to learn complex interaction strategies that could encompass emotional and pragmatic considerations [14]. Human-in-the-loop training frameworks also play a critical role by incorporating human feedback and expertise to refine model performance, offering a pathway to imbue systems with more human-like qualities based on direct human experience [14]. The synthesis of these technological approaches with a deeper understanding of human conversational dynamics is driving the field towards dialogue systems that are not merely functional but genuinely interactive and human-like.​  

# 8.4 Ethical Considerations  

Ethical considerations are paramount in the development and deployment of spoken dialogue models, encompassing a broad spectrum of concerns from potential biases to the implications of conversational agents in sensitive domains [3,5,29]. The significance of this topic is increasingly recognized within the research community, with major conferences explicitly highlighting ethical considerations for AI-based systems as a key area of focus [3]. For instance, the ACL 2023 conference included "Ethics and NLP" as a distinct research sub-direction, underscoring its centrality in natural language processing advancements [24].​  

Specific ethical challenges in dialogue generation are actively being investigated. One notable area concerns the potential for dialogue systems to produce offensive or harmful content. Research addressing this includes analyses of the stance and behavior of neural dialogue generation models in offensive contexts, exploring methods to mitigate the generation of  

undesirable outputs [15]. Ensuring dialogue models adhere to ethical boundaries and avoid generating inappropriate responses is a critical step towards responsible AI development.  

Beyond offensive content generation, the scope of ethical considerations extends to vital aspects such as fairness, transparency, and the potential for bias within conversational systems [3,5,29]. While the provided digests primarily highlight the recognition and importance of these ethical dimensions and point to specific challenges like offensive content, further detailed analysis is needed regarding the potential for bias in different contexts, such as healthcare or education, and the concrete steps required for mitigation. Establishing comprehensive guidelines for the ethical development and deployment of spoken dialogue models remains an ongoing imperative to ensure these technologies benefit society responsibly [3,5,29].​  

# 9. Conclusion  

This survey has provided a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in spoken dialogue systems (SDSs), which address the core problem of handling complex multi-turn interactions to facilitate efficient, natural, and intelligent humanmachine communication [1,2]. Significant progress has been made across various key task modules, driven largely by the application of deep learning and sophisticated neural models [18].​  

Major advancements include the successful application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for creating dialogue agents capable of assisting users in completing specific tasks [5] and enhancing response generation in open-domain conversations by combining sequence-to-sequence models with RL [4]. Hierarchical reinforcement learning, in particular, has demonstrated the potential to improve system performance in goal-oriented scenarios [5]. Furthermore, research into learning reward functions from expert evaluations and performance metrics has shown promise for optimizing online learning in SDSs, enabling the extraction of relevant information from performance feedback [6,7].​  

Improvements in dialogue management, a critical component for handling changes in user intent, slot values, and system actions, have focused on addressing challenges such as poor scalability, insufficient tagged data, and low training efficiency. Novel methods and frameworks, including human-in-the-loop training and advanced models, are being explored to enhance robustness and efficiency [14]. The evolution of dialogue management has also seen the introduction of statistical approaches like POMDPs, alongside discussions of their associated challenges [1,2].​  

Architectural innovations, such as the adoption of Transformer-based models, have shown advantages in terms of accuracy and speed, particularly for handling complex, multi-turn conversations, highlighting their potential to advance SDS capabilities [11]. The field has also seen significant strides in supporting multilingual and multimodal interaction, acknowledging the importance of integrating various communicative cues and modalities like audio and video. Transfer learning and hierarchical attention have proven effective in multimodal tasks such as Audio-Visual Scene-Aware Dialogue (AVSD), emphasizing the value of considering dialogue history as contextual knowledge [10,12,13].  

Beyond functional capabilities, recent work has explored incorporating emotional diversity and empathetic responses to create more realistic and engaging conversational AI. Systems for expressive speech synthesis, such as DiffCSS, represent advancements in this area [19]. Similarly, generating shared laughter has been shown to improve the perceived quality and empathetic nature of dialogues [17]. The growing focus on aspects like emotional support and customer assistance underscores the expanding practical applications and potential societal impact of SDSs [3]. The potential impact extends to revolutionary applications in areas like child development and education, leveraging NLP and AI to create personalized learning experiences [29].​  

Despite these considerable advancements, significant challenges remain. Issues related to dialogue interpretation, interaction complexity, system design robustness, data scarcity, scalability, and training efficiency persist [1,2,10,14]. The effective integration of ordering information from dialogue history and the expansion to incorporate a wider range of modalities also require further research [13]. Furthermore, as SDSs become more integrated into critical applications like emotional support and customer service, ethical considerations surrounding AI-driven conversational agents are gaining prominence [3].​  

Looking ahead, promising research directions include the continued exploration of large language models (LLMs) and advanced neural architectures, further enhancing multilingual and multimodal capabilities, improving the robustness and efficiency of dialogue management, and advancing the ability of systems to understand and generate emotionally intelligent and expressive communication [3,13,17,19]. Refined evaluation methodologies and techniques for leveraging human feedback will also be crucial for driving progress [6,7]. Realizing the full potential of spoken dialogue technology to enable truly natural, intelligent, and beneficial interactions necessitates continued, dedicated research efforts across these multifaceted challenges.
