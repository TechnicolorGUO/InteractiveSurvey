# 2 Introduction
Speech language models have witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, driven by the proliferation of large-scale datasets, the development of sophisticated neural architectures, and the integration of multimodal data. These models have revolutionized various applications, including speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and speech translation, by enabling more accurate, natural, and context-aware processing of speech and language [1]. The ability to handle complex and diverse speech data, coupled with the increasing demand for real-time and personalized speech services, has propelled the field into a new era of innovation and practical utility. However, despite these advances, several challenges remain, including the need for models that can effectively manage long-context and spontaneous speech, handle heterogeneous data sources, and ensure robust performance across different environments and tasks [2].

This survey paper focuses on the latest developments in speech language models, with a particular emphasis on multimodal and multitask models, optimization and evaluation techniques, robustness and synthetic data generation, and innovations in text-to-speech and speech translation. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field, highlighting key research contributions, emerging trends, and future directions. By synthesizing insights from a wide range of studies, this survey seeks to inform both researchers and practitioners about the most promising approaches and methodologies in the domain of speech language models.

The integration of large language models (LLMs) and speech codec technologies has emerged as a pivotal area of research, particularly in the context of long-context and spontaneous speech generation [3]. Curriculum learning, a technique that systematically increases the complexity of training data, has proven effective in enhancing the capabilities of LLMs to handle extended and dynamic speech. This approach involves training the model on progressively longer and more varied speech contexts, culminating in fine-tuning on spontaneous speech data [3]. The use of chunk-wise autoregressive speech detokenizers and context-aware fine-tuning modules further enriches the model's generative capabilities, ensuring smooth and coherent speech output [3]. Additionally, the paper explores context-aware fine-tuning, which leverages large language models to generate rich context embeddings, improving the model's understanding and performance in various speech processing tasks [4]. Data augmentation and standardization techniques are also discussed, highlighting their importance in handling the heterogeneity of data sources and enhancing model robustness.

Optimization and evaluation of multimodal models are critical for improving the performance and reliability of speech language models. The paper delves into model variants designed for performance optimization, such as parameter-efficient tuning methods and specialized architectures that enhance computational efficiency and reduce latency. Data-centric approaches, which focus on improving data quality and diversity, are also examined, emphasizing the role of auxiliary tasks and high-quality datasets in enhancing multimodal understanding. The evaluation of source-target alignment in speech translation is another key area covered, with a focus on methods for assessing the quality of alignment and the impact of various perturbations on the performance of speech translation systems [1].

The survey paper also addresses the challenges of robustness and synthetic data generation in speech processing. It discusses the use of synthetic data to enhance model performance, particularly in scenarios with limited or imbalanced real data. Real-time MRI for high-resolution speech synthesis and input perturbation for explainable speech classification are highlighted as innovative techniques that offer new avenues for improving the quality and interpretability of speech models. Furthermore, the paper explores the robustness evaluation of audio watermarking techniques and the use of synthetic data for privacy and data scarcity, underscoring the importance of these methods in ensuring the security and ethical use of speech data [5].

Finally, the paper reviews recent innovations in text-to-speech and speech translation, including prosody transfer, joint speech-text representation learning, and non-autoregressive TTS with hierarchical VAEs [6]. It also examines end-to-end unsupervised speech translation, the integration of DPPs for diverse prosodic features, and the use of VarianceFlow for enhanced TTS quality and controllability [7]. These advancements collectively contribute to the development of more versatile, high-quality, and context-aware speech language models.

The contributions of this survey paper lie in its comprehensive coverage of the latest research in speech language models, its synthesis of key findings and methodologies, and its identification of emerging trends and future directions [8]. By providing a detailed overview of the field, this paper serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, facilitating further advancements and innovations in the domain of speech language models [8].

# 3 Multimodal and Multitask Speech Models

## 3.1 Integration of Large Language Models and Speech Codec Technologies

### 3.1.1 Curriculum Learning for Long-Context and Spontaneous Speech Generation
Curriculum learning has emerged as a powerful technique to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in handling long-context and spontaneous speech generation tasks [3]. This approach involves systematically increasing the complexity of training data, allowing the model to gradually build up its understanding and generation capabilities. In the context of speech generation, this method is particularly useful for addressing the challenges posed by long-form and dynamic speech, which often require the model to maintain coherence over extended periods and adapt to spontaneous changes in the conversation.

The curriculum learning strategy for long-context and spontaneous speech generation typically consists of three stages [3]. Initially, the model is trained on short, well-structured speech segments to establish a solid foundation in basic speech generation. This stage focuses on ensuring that the model can accurately reproduce and understand the content of short utterances, laying the groundwork for more complex tasks. As the model progresses, it is exposed to increasingly longer and more varied speech contexts, which helps it develop the ability to maintain coherence and relevance over extended periods. This intermediate stage is crucial for building the model's capacity to handle longer conversations and narratives.

Finally, the model is fine-tuned on spontaneous speech data, which includes unscripted conversations, podcasts, and other forms of naturally occurring speech. This stage is designed to enhance the model's ability to generate speech that sounds natural and responsive, capturing the nuances of human conversation. By incorporating a chunk-wise autoregressive speech detokenizer, the model can effectively manage the transition between different segments of speech, ensuring smooth and coherent output [3]. Additionally, the use of context-aware fine-tuning modules allows the model to infer and incorporate contextual information from preceding utterances, further enriching its generative capabilities [4]. This comprehensive approach not only improves the model's performance in long-context scenarios but also enhances its spontaneity and adaptability in real-world applications.

### 3.1.2 Context-Aware Fine-Tuning for Enhanced Model Understanding
Context-aware fine-tuning has emerged as a critical technique to enhance the understanding and performance of large language models (LLMs) in various speech processing tasks. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods that operate on isolated utterances, context-aware fine-tuning leverages the broader conversational or document-level context to provide richer and more nuanced representations [4]. This approach is particularly important in tasks such as speech recognition, natural language understanding (NLU), and speech synthesis, where the context can significantly influence the interpretation and generation of speech.

One of the key strategies in context-aware fine-tuning is the use of large language models to generate context embeddings [4]. These embeddings capture the semantic and syntactic nuances of the preceding text, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the current input. By integrating these context embeddings into the speech model, the system can better handle complex and ambiguous inputs, leading to improved accuracy and coherence. For instance, in speech recognition tasks, context-aware models can disambiguate homophones and resolve referential ambiguities more effectively, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the transcriptions.

Moreover, the integration of context-aware fine-tuning with advanced model architectures, such as transformers, has further amplified the benefits. Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms, are inherently capable of capturing long-range dependencies, making them well-suited for context-aware tasks. By fine-tuning these models on large, context-rich datasets, researchers have observed significant improvements in tasks that require understanding of extended dialogues or documents. Additionally, the use of curriculum learning and chunk-wise autoregressive techniques ensures that the models can efficiently handle long-context scenarios, making them more robust and versatile in real-world applications.

### 3.1.3 Data Augmentation and Standardization for Heterogeneous Data Sources
Data augmentation and standardization are crucial for handling the heterogeneity of data sources in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Heterogeneous data sources, such as text, images, and audio, often come with varying formats, resolutions, and preprocessing protocols, which can lead to inconsistencies and suboptimal model performance. Data augmentation techniques, such as random cropping, flipping, and noise injection, are commonly applied to image and audio data to increase the diversity of the training set and improve the model's robustness to variations. For text data, techniques like synonyms replacement, sentence shuffling, and back-translation can be used to generate additional training examples. These methods help in reducing overfitting and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across different data distributions.

Standardization, on the other hand, involves normalizing the data to a common format and scale, ensuring that the model receives consistent input regardless of the source. This is particularly important for audio data, where different recording devices and environments can introduce significant variability. Techniques such as Mel-Spectrogram normalization, where the audio is converted into a standardized Mel-Spectrogram representation, and feature scaling, where features are normalized to a specific range, are widely used. For text data, tokenization and lemmatization are essential steps to standardize the input, making it easier for the model to process and understand the content. In the context of MLLMs, standardization also involves aligning the data across different modalities, such as synchronizing text and audio timestamps, to ensure that the model can effectively learn the relationships between different data types.

To further enhance the effectiveness of data augmentation and standardization, recent research has focused on developing more sophisticated techniques that can adapt to the specific characteristics of the data. For example, adaptive augmentation strategies that dynamically adjust the augmentation parameters based on the data distribution have shown promising results. Similarly, advanced normalization techniques, such as batch normalization and layer normalization, have been integrated into the model architectures to improve the stability and performance of training. These advancements not only help in handling the heterogeneity of data sources but also contribute to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of MLLMs in a wide range of applications.

## 3.2 Optimization and Evaluation of Multimodal Models

### 3.2.1 Model Variants for Performance Optimization
Model variants designed for performance optimization in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have become a focal point of recent research [9]. These variants aim to enhance computational efficiency, reduce latency, and improve overall model performance while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy. One prominent approach is the use of parameter-efficient tuning methods, such as adapters and low-rank adaptation, which allow for fine-tuning large models with minimal additional parameters. Adapters, for instance, insert small, trainable modules into pre-trained models, enabling them to learn task-specific representations without retraining the entire model. This approach significantly reduces the computational overhead and makes it feasible to deploy large models in resource-constrained environments.

Another key area of innovation is the development of specialized architectures that optimize specific aspects of model performance. For example, the Encoder-Adapter-LLM framework combines the strengths of large language models with task-specific adapters to create a modular and flexible architecture. This framework allows for efficient fine-tuning and adaptation to new tasks while retaining the general language understanding capabilities of the base model. Additionally, the introduction of dynamic and context-aware components, such as context modules that incorporate historical information, has shown promise in improving the coherence and context sensitivity of generated outputs. These modules enable models to maintain a consistent context over longer sequences, which is particularly beneficial for tasks like speech synthesis and dialogue systems.

Furthermore, the integration of advanced codec technologies and efficient inference techniques has played a crucial role in optimizing the performance of speech models [10]. For instance, the use of low-latency codecs that focus on reducing the number of audio frames processed per second has led to significant improvements in real-time speech processing [10]. This is especially important for applications requiring low-latency responses, such as live transcription and real-time translation. Additionally, the application of knowledge distillation techniques to compress large models into smaller, more efficient versions has enabled the deployment of high-performance models on edge devices, thereby broadening their applicability in various real-world scenarios.

### 3.2.2 Data-Centric Approaches for Multimodal Understanding
Data-centric approaches for multimodal understanding emphasize the importance of data quality, diversity, and the design of auxiliary tasks to enhance the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) [9]. Unlike traditional model-centric approaches that focus on optimizing the architecture and training algorithms, data-centric methods aim to improve the data itself, ensuring that it is more representative, balanced, and informative. This is particularly crucial in multimodal settings, where the interplay between different modalities (e.g., text, speech, and images) can significantly affect the model's ability to generalize and perform well on unseen tasks.

One key strategy in data-centric approaches is the creation of high-quality, diverse datasets that cover a wide range of scenarios and contexts. For instance, the development of datasets like DynamicSUPERB, which includes over 20 publicly available English datasets spanning six dimensions (content, speaker, semantics, degradation, paralinguistics, and audio), allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs. By designing tasks that involve text instructions, speech utterances, and text labels, these datasets enable the assessment of a model's zero-shot learning capabilities and its ability to handle unseen tasks [11]. This approach not only enhances the robustness of the models but also facilitates the identification of areas where further improvement is needed.

Another important aspect of data-centric approaches is the use of auxiliary tasks to augment the primary training objectives. These tasks are designed to leverage the inherent structure and relationships within the data, thereby improving the model's understanding of the underlying multimodal information. For example, in the context of speech processing, auxiliary tasks such as speaker identification, emotion recognition, and noise robustness can be integrated into the training pipeline. By doing so, the model learns to capture and utilize a richer set of features, leading to improved performance on primary tasks such as speech recognition and synthesis. Additionally, the use of data augmentation techniques, such as RepAugment, which is input-agnostic and can be applied universally to pretrained models, further enhances the model's ability to generalize and adapt to new scenarios.

### 3.2.3 Evaluation of Source-Target Alignment in Speech Translation
The evaluation of source-target alignment in speech translation (ST) is a critical aspect that significantly impacts the performance and reliability of speech translation systems [1]. Source-target alignment refers to the correspondence between the source speech and the target translation, which can be assessed at various levels, including word, phrase, and sentence. The alignment process involves identifying the temporal and semantic correspondences between the source speech segments and the target text, ensuring that the translated content accurately reflects the original speech. This alignment is particularly challenging due to the inherent differences in the structure and flow of spoken versus written language, as well as the variability in speech rates and accents.

Several methods have been proposed to evaluate the quality of source-target alignment in ST systems. One common approach is to use automatic alignment tools that leverage dynamic time warping (DTW) or hidden Markov models (HMMs) to align the source speech and target text. These tools can provide fine-grained alignment at the word level, allowing for the assessment of word-level accuracy and timing. Another method involves manual evaluation by human annotators, who can provide more nuanced feedback on the semantic and contextual alignment of the translation. However, manual evaluation is time-consuming and subjective, making it less scalable for large-scale assessments.

To address the limitations of these methods, recent research has focused on developing more robust and automated evaluation metrics that can capture the complexities of source-target alignment [1]. For instance, some studies have explored the use of neural network-based models to predict alignment scores, which can provide a more comprehensive and objective assessment of the alignment quality. These models are trained on large datasets of aligned speech and text pairs, learning to identify patterns and discrepancies in the alignment. Additionally, the integration of cross-lingual embeddings and contextualized representations has shown promise in improving the accuracy and robustness of alignment evaluation, particularly in low-resource scenarios where labeled data is limited.

# 4 Robustness and Synthetic Data in Speech Processing

## 4.1 Synthetic Data Generation and Utilization

### 4.1.1 Enhancing Model Performance with Curated Synthetic Data
Enhancing model performance in speech synthesis and related tasks has been significantly bolstered by the strategic use of curated synthetic data. This approach leverages advanced generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and transformers, to create synthetic datasets that can address issues of data scarcity and imbalance. For instance, the AudioMarkData dataset, which includes 20,000 meticulously sub-sampled audio samples from the Common Voice dataset, ensures balanced representation across biological sexes, languages, and age groups [5]. This balance is crucial for training models that perform consistently across diverse populations and contexts.

The use of synthetic data is particularly valuable in scenarios where real data is limited or subject to stringent privacy regulations. For example, in the development of an Edge-AI smart-toy platform, synthetic data generated using StyleGAN-2 has been used to create a gender-balanced dataset of synthetic children's faces [12]. This dataset not only ensures compliance with privacy laws but also provides nuanced control over attributes such as facial expressions, age variations, and synchronization with speech-driven movements. Such control is essential for training models that can generate realistic and contextually appropriate content, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.

Moreover, the integration of synthetic data into the training pipeline can improve the robustness and generalization capabilities of speech synthesis models [2]. For instance, the LUCY model, an end-to-end speech system, leverages a large corpus of synthetic conversations to enhance emotion control, naturalness, and informativeness [8]. By refining the training and decoding pipelines to handle the complexities of multi-round interactions and function-call data, LUCY demonstrates superior performance across various evaluation metrics. This approach not only augments the training data but also ensures that the model can effectively handle a wide range of conversational scenarios, making it more adaptable and reliable in real-world applications.

### 4.1.2 Real-Time MRI for High-Resolution Speech Synthesis
Real-time MRI for high-resolution speech synthesis represents a significant advancement in the field of speech processing, offering a unique approach to generating highly realistic and vivid speech. Unlike traditional methods that rely on acoustic models and signal processing techniques, MRI-based speech synthesis leverages the detailed and dynamic information captured from the articulatory movements of the vocal tract. This method captures the intricate movements of the tongue, lips, and jaw during speech production, providing a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the speech production process. The use of MRI data allows for the synthesis of speech that not only sounds natural but also closely mimics the speaker's unique articulatory patterns, leading to a more personalized and expressive speech output.

However, the application of MRI in speech synthesis is not without challenges. One of the primary issues is the reverberation effect introduced by the MRI machine's environment, which can significantly degrade the quality of the synthesized speech. To address this, recent research has focused on developing advanced signal processing techniques and machine learning models to enhance the quality of MRI data and mitigate the effects of reverberation. For instance, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been employed to directly synthesize high-quality speech waveforms from MRI data, bypassing the need for intermediate acoustic models [13]. These GAN-based approaches have shown promising results in improving the clarity and naturalness of the synthesized speech, even in the presence of environmental noise.

Moreover, the integration of MRI data with other modalities, such as electromagnetic articulography (EMA), has further enhanced the performance of speech synthesis systems [13]. By combining the strengths of MRI and EMA, researchers have been able to capture both the detailed articulatory movements and the temporal dynamics of speech production [13]. This multimodal approach not only improves the accuracy of the synthesized speech but also provides a more robust and versatile system capable of handling a wide range of speaking styles and conditions. The future of MRI-based speech synthesis lies in the development of more efficient and data-driven models that can operate in real-time, making this technology accessible for a broader range of applications, from assistive communication devices to advanced voice assistants.

### 4.1.3 Input Perturbation for Explainable Speech Classification
Input perturbation is a powerful technique in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) that has gained significant traction in the domain of speech classification. By systematically altering specific components of the input signal, this method aims to identify which elements of the audio data are most critical for the model's decision-making process. In the context of speech classification, input perturbation can provide valuable insights into the model's reliance on both linguistic and paralinguistic features. For instance, perturbing the pitch of an utterance can reveal how changes in prosody influence the model's predictions, while adding background noise can highlight the impact of environmental factors on classification accuracy.

The application of input perturbation in speech classification typically involves a two-step process: perturbation and evaluation. During the perturbation phase, various transformations are applied to the original audio signal, such as time-stretching, pitch-shifting, or introducing controlled levels of noise. These transformations are designed to mimic real-world variations that might occur in the audio environment. Following the perturbation, the modified signals are fed into the speech classification model, and the resulting changes in the model's output are analyzed. This evaluation step helps to quantify the sensitivity of the model to different types of perturbations, thereby shedding light on the model's internal mechanisms and potential vulnerabilities.

Moreover, input perturbation can be extended to generate fine-grained explanations at the phoneme or word level, which are particularly useful for tasks requiring high interpretability, such as emotion recognition or speaker verification. By isolating and perturbing individual phonemes or words, researchers can pinpoint the exact segments of speech that contribute most significantly to the model's decisions. This level of detail not only enhances the transparency of the model but also aids in the identification of biases or anomalies in the classification process. Overall, input perturbation serves as a versatile tool for improving the explainability and robustness of speech classification models, making it an essential component in the development of trustworthy and reliable speech processing systems.

## 4.2 Robustness Evaluation and Data Augmentation

### 4.2.1 Benchmarking Audio Watermarking Techniques
In the realm of digital media security, audio watermarking has emerged as a critical technique for copyright protection, content authentication, and data integrity verification [5]. AudioMarkBench, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the robustness of audio watermarking techniques, aims to provide a comprehensive assessment framework. This benchmark evaluates three state-of-the-art audio watermarking methods across 15 different perturbations, including both watermark-removal and watermark-forgery attacks [5]. The perturbations are designed to simulate real-world challenges that watermarked audio might face, such as common audio edits, compression, and adversarial attacks [5]. Twelve of these perturbations, termed "no-box" attacks, do not require any knowledge of the watermarking method, making them particularly challenging and realistic.

The benchmarking process involves two primary datasets, each containing a diverse set of audio samples to ensure a robust evaluation. The first dataset consists of natural, unaltered audio clips, while the second includes AI-generated audio, reflecting the growing concern over deepfake audio. Each watermarking method is subjected to the 15 perturbations, and the robustness is measured by the method's ability to detect the watermark accurately after the perturbation. The evaluation metrics include detection rate, false positive rate, and the integrity of the watermark. The results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each method, providing valuable insights for researchers and developers.

Our findings reveal that while all evaluated methods perform well in the absence of perturbations, their robustness varies significantly under different types of attacks. For instance, certain no-box perturbations, such as EnCodec, pose a substantial threat to the detectability of watermarks. These findings underscore the need for more resilient watermarking techniques that can withstand a wide range of adversarial attacks. Additionally, the benchmark highlights the importance of considering both natural and AI-generated audio in the evaluation process, as the latter presents unique challenges that are not adequately addressed by current methods. This comprehensive benchmark serves as a foundational tool for advancing the field of audio watermarking and enhancing the security of digital audio content.

### 4.2.2 Sequence Tagging for Audio Forgery Detection
Sequence tagging for audio forgery detection represents a novel approach to identifying and localizing manipulated segments within audio files. Unlike traditional binary classification methods that determine whether an audio clip is real or fake, sequence tagging involves assigning a label to each frame of the audio, thereby pinpointing the exact locations of potential forgeries. This granular approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where deepfake audio may be spliced into otherwise genuine recordings, making it crucial to identify the precise boundaries of the fabricated content. The TranssionADD system, for instance, employs a sequence tagging framework to predict the label of each audio frame, subsequently merging contiguous frames with the same label to delineate the segments of interest. This method not only enhances the accuracy of forgery detection but also provides actionable insights into the nature and extent of the manipulation.

The implementation of sequence tagging in audio forgery detection leverages advanced neural network architectures, such as Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) networks, to extract both spatial and temporal features from the audio frames. These models are adept at capturing the nuanced patterns and temporal dynamics that distinguish real audio from synthetic or tampered content. The RCNN-BLSTM architecture, in particular, excels in this task by combining the strengths of convolutional layers, which are effective at extracting local features, with the temporal modeling capabilities of BLSTM units. This hybrid approach ensures that the model can accurately tag each frame while maintaining a coherent understanding of the audio's temporal structure. The result is a robust system capable of detecting even subtle manipulations that might evade simpler detection methods.

To further enhance the performance of sequence tagging models, researchers have explored various techniques to improve the generalization and reliability of the detection process. One such technique involves the use of adversarial training, where the model is exposed to a diverse range of perturbations and forgeries during training. This exposure helps the model develop a more comprehensive understanding of the potential attack vectors and improves its ability to generalize to unseen data. Additionally, the integration of attention mechanisms allows the model to focus on the most salient features of the audio, thereby reducing the impact of noise and irrelevant information. These advancements in sequence tagging have significant implications for the field of audio forensics, offering a powerful tool for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of audio content in an era where deepfake technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated.

### 4.2.3 Synthetic Data for Privacy and Data Scarcity
Synthetic data generation has emerged as a critical solution to address privacy concerns and data scarcity in the field of speech processing. The use of synthetic data allows researchers and developers to bypass the ethical and legal hurdles associated with collecting and using real human data, particularly in sensitive domains such as healthcare or financial services. By leveraging advanced generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), synthetic datasets can be created that closely mimic the characteristics of real-world data, thereby enabling the training of robust machine learning models without compromising individual privacy.

One of the primary advantages of synthetic data is its ability to provide a controlled environment for experimentation and model training. This is especially valuable in scenarios where real data is limited or unavailable due to privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For instance, in the development of Edge-AI smart-toy platforms, synthetic speech data can be used to train models that interact with children, ensuring that the models are effective while adhering to strict data protection standards. Moreover, synthetic data can be tailored to include a diverse range of attributes, such as different accents, languages, and emotional states, which enhances the generalizability and robustness of the trained models.

Despite the benefits, the use of synthetic data also presents challenges, particularly in ensuring the quality and realism of the generated data. Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion technologies have significantly improved the fidelity and naturalness of synthetic speech, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish from real human speech [14]. However, this also raises new concerns, such as the potential for misuse in impersonation or the spread of disinformation. To mitigate these risks, researchers are developing sophisticated detection methods that can identify synthetic speech, including techniques based on frequency features, cepstral analysis, and deep learning models. Additionally, the integration of synthetic data into existing workflows requires careful validation to ensure that the synthetic data accurately represents the real-world scenarios it is intended to simulate.

# 5 Text-to-Speech and Speech Translation Innovations

## 5.1 Prosody Transfer and Joint Representation Learning

### 5.1.1 Corpus-Based Evaluation of Prosody Transfer
Corpus-based evaluation of prosody transfer in Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of prosodic control and the naturalness of synthesized speech [15]. This evaluation typically involves a corpus of sentences, each with multiple prosodically distinct natural renditions, serving as references. The TTS system is tasked with transferring the prosody from these references to the synthesized speech [16]. The primary challenge lies in accurately capturing and reproducing the subtle variations in intonation, stress, and rhythm that define the prosodic characteristics of the reference utterances. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, the corpus must be carefully curated to include a wide range of prosodic styles and contexts, reflecting the diversity of real-world speech.

One of the key aspects of corpus-based evaluation is the subjective assessment by human listeners. Subjective methods, such as the AXY discrimination task, involve presenting listeners with a reference utterance (A) and two synthesized samples (X and Y) and asking them to rate the similarity of X and Y to A. This method provides valuable insights into the perceptual quality of prosody transfer but can be resource-intensive and subject to listener variability [15]. Trained linguists are often preferred for such evaluations due to their expertise in identifying subtle prosodic differences. However, the use of trained evaluators can introduce biases and may not always be feasible for large-scale assessments. Therefore, developing robust and efficient subjective evaluation methods remains an ongoing area of research.

Objective metrics, while less nuanced, can complement subjective evaluations by providing quantitative measures of prosody transfer [15]. Commonly used metrics include spectral distance, fundamental frequency (F0) correlation, and duration accuracy. These metrics assess the fidelity of prosodic features in the synthesized speech relative to the reference. However, they often fail to capture the holistic perception of naturalness and expressiveness that human listeners can discern. Integrating both subjective and objective evaluations can offer a more comprehensive assessment of prosody transfer, helping researchers and developers to identify strengths and weaknesses in TTS systems and guide future improvements.

### 5.1.2 Joint Speech-Text Representation Learning
Joint speech-text representation learning has emerged as a critical component in advancing the capabilities of text-to-speech (TTS) systems, particularly in addressing the one-to-many (O2M) mapping problem inherent in speech synthesis [7]. This approach involves the integration of speech and text representations to create a unified feature space that can effectively capture the complex relationships between linguistic content and acoustic characteristics. By leveraging deep learning techniques, joint models can learn to map textual inputs to diverse and natural-sounding speech outputs, even for unseen speakers or dialects. The key to this approach lies in the design of the shared representation space, where both speech and text features are encoded and aligned to facilitate the synthesis process.

One of the primary methods for achieving joint speech-text representation learning is through the use of shared encoders that process both speech and text inputs [17]. These encoders are typically designed to extract high-level features that capture the semantic and phonetic content of the input. For instance, the speech encoder might extract mel-spectrogram features, while the text encoder processes the input text to generate linguistic embeddings. The outputs of these encoders are then passed through a common shared encoder, which learns to align the speech and text representations in a joint feature space [17]. This alignment is crucial for ensuring that the synthesized speech not only sounds natural but also accurately reflects the intended linguistic content. Techniques such as consistency loss and adversarial training are often employed to enhance the quality and robustness of the joint representations.

The effectiveness of joint speech-text representation learning has been demonstrated in various applications, including cross-lingual TTS, speaker adaptation, and emotion transfer. For example, in cross-lingual TTS, joint models can leverage large amounts of text data in one language to improve the synthesis of speech in another language, even when the target language has limited labeled data. Similarly, in speaker adaptation, joint models can use a small amount of speaker-specific data to fine-tune the shared representation space, enabling the synthesis of speech with the desired speaker characteristics. Overall, the ability to learn and leverage joint speech-text representations has significantly advanced the field of TTS, paving the way for more versatile and high-quality speech synthesis systems [16].

### 5.1.3 Non-Autoregressive TTS with Hierarchical VAEs
Non-Autoregressive (NAR) Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems have gained significant attention due to their ability to generate speech in parallel, thereby reducing synthesis latency [14]. Among various NAR TTS approaches, those incorporating Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) stand out for their capability to capture complex, multi-scale variations in speech [7]. Hierarchical VAEs decompose the latent space into multiple levels, each representing different aspects of the speech signal, such as global speaker characteristics, local prosodic variations, and fine-grained acoustic details. This hierarchical decomposition allows for more expressive and controllable speech synthesis, addressing the limitations of single-scale VAEs, which often struggle to capture the full range of prosodic nuances.

In the context of NAR TTS, hierarchical VAEs are typically integrated into the model architecture to enhance the representation of both text and speech [7]. For instance, a global VAE module can encode speaker-specific attributes, enabling the system to generalize across different speakers, including unseen ones. Meanwhile, a local VAE module captures the temporal dynamics and prosodic variations within the speech signal, ensuring that the synthesized speech retains natural intonation and rhythm. This dual-level VAE setup facilitates zero-shot TTS, where the model can adapt to new speakers without retraining, by leveraging the learned latent representations to infer the characteristics of the reference speech.

Furthermore, the use of hierarchical VAEs in NAR TTS models has led to significant improvements in the quality and diversity of synthesized speech [7]. By allowing for more flexible and nuanced control over the latent variables, these models can generate speech with richer prosodic patterns, making the output more natural and engaging. Experimental results have shown that hierarchical VAE-based NAR TTS systems outperform their single-scale counterparts in terms of both objective metrics (e.g., MOS scores) and subjective evaluations, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in advancing the state of the art in TTS technology.

## 5.2 Unsupervised and Adaptive Translation Systems

### 5.2.1 End-to-End Unsupervised Speech Translation
End-to-end unsupervised speech translation (UST) has emerged as a promising area in speech processing, aiming to translate speech from one language to another without the need for parallel text or speech data [18]. This approach leverages unsupervised techniques to transcribe speech in the source language, translate the transcription, and synthesize the translated text into speech in the target language [18]. The process typically involves three main stages: unsupervised speech recognition (ASR), unsupervised machine translation (MT), and unsupervised text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis [1]. Each stage is crucial and builds upon recent advancements in self-supervised learning and generative models.

In the first stage, unsupervised ASR models, such as those based on self-supervised audio representation learning (e.g., wav2vec 2.0), are used to transcribe speech into text [17]. These models are trained on large amounts of untranscribed speech data, learning robust representations that can be converted into discrete units or phoneme sequences. The transcribed text is then fed into an unsupervised MT system, which translates the text from the source language to the target language. Unsupervised MT models, such as those using back-translation and denoising autoencoders, have shown significant progress in generating accurate translations without parallel corpora. The translated text is subsequently synthesized into speech using unsupervised TTS models, which can generate natural-sounding speech from text without the need for aligned text-speech pairs [1].

Recent advancements in unsupervised TTS have focused on leveraging self-supervised speech representations and generative models to improve the quality and naturalness of synthesized speech [18]. Techniques such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and flow-based models have been particularly effective in handling the one-to-many mapping problem inherent in TTS, allowing for the generation of diverse and natural speech [7]. Additionally, the integration of prosody modeling and adversarial training has further enhanced the speech quality, making end-to-end UST systems more robust and versatile [7]. These advancements collectively contribute to the development of more efficient and high-fidelity speech translation systems, paving the way for real-world applications in multilingual communication and accessibility [1].

### 5.2.2 DPP Integration for Diverse Prosodic Features
In the realm of Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis, integrating Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) into prosody generation models has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the diversity and naturalness of synthesized speech [16]. DPPs are probabilistic models that capture the notion of diversity within a set of items, making them particularly suitable for generating prosodic features that vary in pitch, energy, and timing. By leveraging DPPs, TTS models can produce speech with a richer and more varied prosodic structure, which is essential for conveying different emotional states and speaker identities. This section explores the integration of DPPs in TTS, focusing on the technical challenges and solutions that have been proposed.

One of the primary challenges in integrating DPPs for prosodic feature generation is the variability in the length and structure of prosodic segments [14]. Unlike fixed-length features such as phonemes, prosodic features can vary significantly in duration and complexity, which complicates the direct application of DPPs. To address this, researchers have developed methods to segment the input text into more manageable units, such as phrases or clauses, and then apply DPPs to these segments. This approach ensures that the DPP can effectively model the diversity within each segment while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, the use of Prosodic Boundary Detectors (PBDs) has been instrumental in identifying key segments for DPP sampling, thereby improving the coherence and naturalness of the synthesized speech.

Another critical aspect of DPP integration is the incorporation of conditional information to guide the sampling process. Conditional DPPs (cDPPs) allow the model to generate prosodic features that are contextually relevant to the surrounding text and speech [14]. For instance, cDPPs can be used to sample prosodic features that are consistent with the emotional tone or speaking style of the speaker, leading to more expressive and natural-sounding speech. This is achieved by conditioning the DPP on features extracted from neighboring text segments or previously generated prosodic features [14]. The use of cDPPs not only enhances the diversity of the generated prosody but also ensures that the synthesized speech is coherent and contextually appropriate, making it a valuable tool for applications requiring high levels of expressiveness and naturalness [16].

### 5.2.3 VarianceFlow for Enhanced TTS Quality and Controllability
VarianceFlow represents a significant advancement in the field of Text-to-Speech (TTS) by addressing the limitations of traditional models in terms of both speech quality and controllability [6]. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on mean squared error (MSE) loss for variance modeling, VarianceFlow leverages normalizing flows (NFs) to capture the complex distributions of variance factors such as pitch, duration, and energy. This approach allows for more precise and flexible manipulation of these factors, leading to enhanced naturalness and expressiveness in synthesized speech. The use of NFs enables the model to learn a more accurate and robust mapping between the input text and the corresponding acoustic features, thereby improving the overall quality of the generated speech.

One of the key strengths of VarianceFlow is its ability to achieve high-quality speech synthesis while maintaining fine-grained control over various aspects of the speech signal [6]. By explicitly modeling the variance factors using NFs, the model can generate speech with specific characteristics, such as a desired pitch contour or speaking rate, which can be particularly useful in applications requiring personalized or context-specific speech synthesis. Experimental results have shown that VarianceFlow outperforms both autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (non-AR) state-of-the-art TTS models in terms of speech quality, as measured by metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS). Moreover, the model demonstrates superior controllability, as evidenced by its ability to accurately reproduce provided pitch values and generate diverse speech samples from a single text input.

In addition to its technical innovations, VarianceFlow addresses practical challenges in TTS, such as the need for efficient and scalable training. The model's architecture is designed to facilitate fast convergence during training, making it suitable for large-scale datasets and real-world deployment scenarios. The combination of high-quality speech synthesis, precise controllability, and efficient training makes VarianceFlow a promising approach for advancing the state of the art in TTS technology [6]. Future work may explore the integration of VarianceFlow with other advanced techniques, such as unsupervised learning and cross-lingual adaptation, to further enhance its capabilities and broaden its applicability across different domains and languages.

# 6 Future Directions


Despite the significant advancements in speech language models, several limitations and gaps remain. Current models struggle with managing long-context and spontaneous speech, handling heterogeneous data sources, and ensuring robust performance across different environments and tasks. While curriculum learning and context-aware fine-tuning have shown promise, there is still a need for more sophisticated techniques to maintain coherence and context over extended periods. Additionally, the integration of multimodal data and the handling of diverse and imbalanced datasets pose ongoing challenges. The robustness of models, particularly in the presence of noise and adversarial attacks, remains a critical issue. Furthermore, the ethical considerations and privacy concerns associated with synthetic data generation and usage need to be addressed more comprehensively.

To address these limitations, several directions for future research are proposed. First, the development of advanced curriculum learning frameworks that incorporate more dynamic and adaptive strategies could enhance the model's ability to handle long-context and spontaneous speech. These frameworks could include real-time feedback mechanisms and adaptive difficulty adjustments to better simulate real-world conversational scenarios. Second, the exploration of novel data augmentation techniques that specifically target the heterogeneity of multimodal data could improve the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. Techniques such as cross-modal augmentation, where data from one modality is used to augment another, could be particularly effective. Third, the integration of explainable AI (XAI) techniques into speech models could provide deeper insights into the decision-making processes, enhancing transparency and trust. This is especially important for applications in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance.
