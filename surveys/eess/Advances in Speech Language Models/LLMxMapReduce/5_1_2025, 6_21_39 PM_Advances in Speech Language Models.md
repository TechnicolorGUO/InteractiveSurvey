# 1. Introduction  

Speech Language Models (SLMs) represent a significant advancement at the intersection of speech processing and natural language understanding. Historically, speech processing technologies—particularly speech recognition (speech-to-text)— evolved from early rule-based methods to traditional statistical models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) [21,25]. Although these methods laid foundational principles, they possessed inherent limitations in modeling the complex variabilities in speech. A transformative shift occurred with the advent of deep learning and neural networks, which significantly enhanced the accuracy and efficiency of speech recognition systems [12,25].  

A pivotal architectural innovation in this trajectory has been the Transformer model, introduced in 2017, which has revolutionized various AI domains, including speech recognition [9,27]. The Transformer architecture, primarily through its self‐attention mechanism, effectively addresses limitations of prior neural architectures—such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)—that include issues with gradient vanishing, computational inefficiency, and difficulty in capturing long‐range dependencies [9]. Its capability to model relationships between distant elements in a sequence and facilitate parallel computation has proved instrumental in developing more powerful end‐to‐ end deep learning systems for speech processing [27].​  

The increasing sophistication of SLMs has led to their widespread integration into numerous applications, evolving from laboratory research to pervasive everyday technology [21]. These applications span diverse areas including virtual assistants, automated transcription services, and intelligent conference systems capable of converting speech to text and summarizing content [17], as well as advanced real‐time translation systems such as simultaneous interpreting [6]. Furthermore, these models are impacting related fields such as text‐to‐speech synthesis—where the focus is on faster and more natural audio generation [4,23].  

The development of advanced SLMs is motivated by the continuous need for more natural, efficient, and robust human– computer interaction through speech. A key driver is the ambition to achieve a unified understanding and processing of both speech and text modalities, mirroring the human brain's capabilities [1]. Researchers are actively working to reduce the performance gap often observed between speech and text translation by creating models capable of leveraging knowledge from both modalities [1]. Additionally, motivations include improving the speed and robustness of speech synthesis—addressing the limitations of cascaded systems prone to error accumulation and latency in tasks like speech-tospeech translation [4,6,20]—and enabling effective performance in resource-scarce scenarios, particularly for low-resource languages where labeled data is limited [3,20]. The pursuit of real-time, full-duplex spoken dialogue systems that can handle complex interactions, including overlapping speech and non-verbal cues, also drives innovation in integrated speech–text models [7,13].​  

This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in Speech Language Models, building upon the foundational shifts toward deep learning and the Transformer architecture. It synthesizes the current state of the field by examining key models, methodologies, and applications. The scope encompasses various aspects of SLMs, including advancements in speech recognition, synthesis, translation, and integrated multimodal systems. Despite remarkable progress, the field continues to face significant challenges such as achieving computational efficiency and low latency essential for real-time processing [6,11,21], effectively leveraging multimodality beyond text [7,18], addressing data scarcity challenges—particularly for low-resource languages and tasks [3,20], ensuring fairness and mitigating inherent model biases [19], and enhancing the interpretability and controllability of complex, data-driven architectures [2].

Finally, Section 5 concludes the survey by summarizing the key findings and outlining promising directions for future research in Speech Language Models.  

# 2. Foundations and Core Techniques  

Speech Language Models (SLMs) represent a convergence of acoustic processing and linguistic understanding, built upon foundational techniques in speech recognition, natural language processing, and sequence modeling. This section delves into the core methodologies underpinning SLMs, tracing the evolution of acoustic and language modeling and detailing the sequence-to-sequence paradigms essential for mapping diverse modalities.  

Acoustic modeling, the initial step in processing speech signals [12,25], focuses on converting raw audio waveforms into meaningful representations. Historically, this task relied heavily on statistical methods such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) often combined with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to model the probability distributions of acoustic features. These traditional approaches captured local dependencies but faced limitations in modeling complex speech variations and long-range temporal contexts [21]. The advent of deep learning marked a significant shift, with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) replacing GMMs within the HMM-DNN hybrid framework and eventually leading to end-to-end neural models. DNNbased acoustic models, including architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or LSTMs for temporal modeling, demonstrated a superior ability to learn complex, hierarchical features directly from data and better capture temporal dynamics [12]. Modern approaches further leverage advanced architectures such as HuBERT, utilizing self-supervised learning and Transformer encoders [20], or specialized encoders like the block-wise unidirectional acoustic encoder in NAST-S2X incorporating causal convolutions and standard Transformer layers for processing features like Mel-spectrograms [6]. Feature extraction itself has evolved from methods like MFCCs and Log-Fbank [12,17] to neural audio codecs that produce discrete or continuous representations [5]. While DNNs offer improved accuracy and representation learning, they often entail higher computational costs and model complexity compared to simpler statistical models [21]. Explicit, detailed comparisons across these models regarding computational cost and accuracy trade-offs, and comprehensive challenges like noise and speaker variability, are not extensively detailed in the provided digests.​  

Complementing acoustic modeling is language modeling, which predicts the probability of word sequences and provides linguistic context. The evolution here mirrors that of acoustic modeling, transitioning from statistical N-gram models to powerful neural networks [15]. N-gram models, while computationally inexpensive, struggle to capture dependencies beyond a limited window (n−1 words) and suffer from data sparsity issues, particularly with rare word sequences, often requiring smoothing techniques [15]. Neural language models, beginning with RNNs and significantly advanced by LSTMs, addressed these limitations by processing sequences iteratively and maintaining a hidden state that could, in principle, encode information from arbitrarily long past contexts, thereby improving the handling of long-range dependencies [12,15]. The Transformer architecture, with its parallelizable self-attention mechanism, revolutionized language modeling, becoming the foundation for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of capturing complex contextual relationships across vast sequences [15]. Pre-training objectives like Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Causal Language Modeling (CLM) are central to training these models, enabling them to understand bidirectional context or predict the next token based on preceding ones [8,16]. Vocabulary construction, involving text cleaning, word embedding $E m b e d d i n g = \operatorname { L o o k u p } ( w )$ , and indexing $I n d e x = \mathrm { L o o k u p } ^ { - 1 } ( E m b e d d i n g )$ , is a prerequisite for neural language modeling [25]. Despite the advancements, challenges remain in robustly handling out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and accurately capturing extremely long-range dependencies in complex linguistic structures. Quantitative performance comparisons between different neural language models using standard metrics were not found within the scope of the provided digests.

Finally, sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning provides a unified framework for tasks involving mapping one sequence to another, crucial for applications like speech translation and text-to-speech synthesis [18,23]. The core of Seq2Seq is the encoder-decoder architecture, where an encoder processes the input sequence (e.g., speech features or text) into a representation, and a decoder generates the output sequence (e.g., translated speech units or text) based on this representation [15,20]. Early Seq2Seq models often used RNNs or LSTMs/GRUs in the encoder and decoder. The  

introduction of attention mechanisms significantly enhanced Seq2Seq performance by allowing the decoder to dynamically weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence during output generation, thereby improving alignment and handling of long sequences [6]. Transformer networks, with their self-attention, have largely replaced recurrent networks in Seq2Seq architectures due to their efficiency and ability to model long-range dependencies effectively [15,20]. While autoregressive decoding is common, leading to potential error propagation and slow inference, alternative nonautoregressive architectures like FastSpeech, which uses a length regulator instead of attention [4], and NAST-S2X, with its block-wise non-autoregressive decoder [6], have been developed to improve speed and robustness by enabling parallel decoding. VALL-E also employs both autoregressive and non-autoregressive components for generating speech units [5]. These models aim to address the challenges of efficiently and accurately mapping variable-length input sequences to output sequences.

In summary, the foundational techniques in SLMs have evolved from traditional statistical methods to sophisticated deep neural network architectures, with a clear trend towards end-to-end learning and the increasing dominance of Transformerbased sequence-to-sequence models equipped with attention mechanisms. These advancements have significantly improved the ability to model complex acoustic features, capture long-range linguistic dependencies, and effectively translate between modalities, laying the groundwork for more advanced speech and language processing capabilities.  

# 2.1 Acoustic Modeling  

Acoustic modeling constitutes a foundational element within speech language models, focusing on the conversion of raw speech signals into meaningful representations that can be processed by subsequent linguistic components. Speech signals, inherently sound waves produced by humans, possess key characteristics including frequency (typically ranging from $1 0 \mathsf { H z }$ to $2 0 \mathsf { k H z }$ ), amplitude (representing sound strength), and time (denoting duration) [21]. Since raw audio time series are not directly amenable to processing by artificial intelligence models, a sequence of preprocessing steps is indispensable to derive suitable intermediate representations, often in the form of a two-dimensional spectrogram matrix [17].​  

The process of feature extraction is central to acoustic modeling, transforming continuous time-domain speech signals into digital feature sequences [12,25]. This typically commences with reading the audio data [17]. Subsequent steps involve preprocessing techniques such as sampling, which digitizes the continuous signal at a fixed rate (e.g., 16 kHz or 44.1 kHz), and filtering, which eliminates extraneous noise and interference through methods like low-pass, high-pass, or band-pass filtering to enhance recognition accuracy [12]. Signal normalization may also be applied, often followed by pre-emphasis to accentuate high-frequency components [17]. Data padding is frequently necessary to ensure consistent input dimensions for the models [17].  

Various types of acoustic features are commonly employed. Fundamental features include the Spectrum, which characterizes the frequency distribution of the signal and can be calculated as  

$$
{ \mathsf { S p e c t r u m } } = { \mathsf { F F T } } ( \times ( { \mathsf { t } } ) ) ,
$$  

the Waveform, describing signal changes over time via  

$$
\mathsf { W a v e f o r m } = ( \mathsf { d } / \mathsf { d } \mathsf { t } ) \times ( \mathsf { t } ) ,
$$  

and Energy, representing total signal intensity determined by  

$\mathsf { E n e r g y } = \int \bigstar \bigstar \bigstar \mathsf { x } ^ { 2 } ( \mathsf { t } )$ dt [25].  

More complex features are derived through transformations of the speech signal. The Log-Fbank method converts the audio from the time domain to the frequency domain to generate a spectrogram, and subsequently applies Mel filter banks to produce a Mel spectrogram [17]. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) decompose the speech signal into multiple frequency bands, calculating the energy within each band to form a time-domain feature vector [12]. Other feature types include Bitrate (BIT) and Autocorrelation Function (ACF), both yielding time-domain feature vectors [12]. Some modern approaches eschew traditional feature extraction in favor of neural audio codecs that convert speech into discrete representations via encoding and vector quantization [5], or by encoding waveforms into continuous representations which are then clustered to label hidden units [20]. Notably, certain models may implicitly handle acoustic modeling by directly synthesizing sound from text, without explicit mention of traditional feature extraction methods like MFCCs or spectrograms [23].​  

Neural networks play a crucial role in acoustic modeling, establishing the relationship between these extracted acoustic features and sub-word units [12]. Various neural network architectures have been adopted for this purpose. The HuBERT model, for instance, utilizes self-supervised learning with a structure comprising multiple one-dimensional convolutional layers and a Transformer encoder. It processes waveforms directly, mapping embeddings to cluster centers via k-means clustering [20]. The acoustic encoder within the NAST-S2X framework employs a block-wise unidirectional design featuring causal convolution layers and standard Transformer layers to encode Mel-spectrogram features [6]. FastSpeech utilizes a feed-forward Transformer network specifically to generate mel-spectrograms non-autoregressively as an intermediate step in text-to-speech synthesis [4]. Models based on Conformer and Transformer architectures have also been applied in tasks such as Chinese speech recognition [17].​  

While the objective is to compare and contrast these various acoustic modeling architectures concerning their computational complexity, accuracy, and ability to handle speech variability [21], the provided digests primarily focus on describing the architectures and their components rather than offering explicit comparative analyses across these specific dimensions. Similarly, a comprehensive summary of common challenges and limitations of current acoustic models, such as difficulties in handling noisy environments, speaker variability, and accents, is not explicitly detailed within the scope of the provided digests.​  

# 2.2 Language Modeling  

Language modeling is a fundamental component in many speech and natural language processing tasks, predicting the probability of a sequence of words or tokens [21]. Traditionally, this role was fulfilled by statistical language models, such as n-gram models. These models estimate the probability of the next word based on the preceding $n - 1$ words. While simple and effective for local dependencies, n-gram models suffer from a limited memory capacity, struggling to capture longrange dependencies and generate coherent text over extended sequences [15]. Techniques like smoothing are employed to mitigate the issue of zero probabilities for unseen n-grams, but the inherent limitation in context size persists.  

The advent of neural networks marked a significant evolution in language modeling [15]. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were introduced to process sequential data, offering improved capabilities for capturing temporal dependencies compared to statistical methods [12,15]. A notable advancement within this paradigm is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. LSTMs, equipped with gating mechanisms, effectively address the vanishing gradient problem inherent in standard RNNs, enabling them to better handle long sequence data and capture long-term dependencies, thereby enhancing performance in tasks like speech recognition [12,15].  

Further progress was achieved with the introduction of the Transformer architecture, which has become pivotal in the development of large language models (LLMs) [15]. The Transformer deviates from the sequential processing of RNNs and LSTMs, utilizing self-attention mechanisms that allow for parallel processing of input sequences [15]. This capability makes Transformers highly suitable for training on large datasets and scaling to models with billions of parameters [15]. Transformer-based models, such as BERT and GPT series [15], have demonstrated superior performance across various NLP tasks. Specific pre-training objectives, like Masked Language Modeling (MLM) which involves predicting masked tokens based on context, and Causal Language Modeling (CLM) which predicts the next word in a sequence  

$$
P ( w _ { t } \mid w _ { 1 } , \ldots , w _ { t - 1 } , \theta )
$$  

are commonly used to train these models [8,16]. The effectiveness of Transformers is also evident in hybrid architectures, such as the combination of Conformer and Transformer models used in modern Chinese speech recognition systems, where the Transformer component converts acoustically derived sequences (like Pinyin) into target text tokens [17]. Language models are also being integrated into other modalities, as seen in models like VALL-E, a Neural Codec Language Model that uses an autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) structure to generate audio based on text and speech prompts [5].  

Before being processed by neural language models, text typically undergoes vocabulary construction. This process involves cleaning text data to remove noise and unwanted information, potentially using metrics like a "beauty score" calculated as $B e a u t y = { \frac { \mathrm { L e n g t h } } { \mathrm { N u m b e r ~ o f ~ u n i q u e ~ c h a r a c t e r s } } }$  

[25]. Words are then converted into numerical representations through word embedding using  

$$
E m b e d d i n g = \operatorname { L o o k u p } ( w )
$$  

allowing neural networks to process them [25]. The inverse process, converting numerical representations back to words, is achieved through word indexing using  

$$
I n d e x = \mathrm { L o o k u p } ^ { - 1 } ( E m b e d d i n g )
$$  

[25].  

While significant strides have been made, current language models still face challenges. Handling extremely long-range dependencies, effectively processing rare words (out-of-vocabulary issues), and ensuring grammatical correctness and fluency in generated text remain areas of active research. The evolution from simpler statistical models to complex neural architectures, particularly Transformers, has substantially improved the ability to capture context and dependencies, but limitations persist, especially in highly nuanced or domain-specific language. The provided digests do not contain specific quantitative performance comparisons between different language models using metrics such as perplexity, BLEU score, or human evaluation.​  

# 2.3 Sequence-to-Sequence Learning  

Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) learning is a fundamental paradigm in modern deep learning, primarily used for tasks involving mapping an input sequence to an output sequence of potentially different lengths. This approach forms the basis for various applications, including machine translation, text summarization, and speech processing. In the domain of speech language models, Seq2Seq is inherently implemented in systems like Deep Voice, which converts a sequence of text characters into a sequence of corresponding speech phonemes [23]. Large Language Models (LLMs) are also described fundamentally as sequence-to-sequence models, predicting the subsequent word in a given sequence [18].  

The core architecture for Seq2Seq learning is the encoder-decoder framework [15]. The encoder processes the input sequence, compressing it into a fixed-length context vector or a sequence of hidden states that capture the essential information. The decoder then uses this representation to generate the output sequence element by element.  

In speech translation, Seq2Seq models are employed to map source speech to target linguistic units. For instance, speechto-unit translation (S2UT) models based on the Transformer architecture utilize an encoder-decoder structure to transform source speech into a sequence of target discrete units [20]. The encoder in such models typically processes input features like log-mel filterbanks, often incorporating downsampling layers, such as cascaded convolutional layers with strides, to reduce the temporal resolution while extracting relevant features [20]. The decoder subsequently generates the translated target unit sequence based on the semantic representations produced by the encoder [20].  

Attention mechanisms are crucial components in many Seq2Seq models, particularly for handling long input and output sequences and improving alignment. By allowing the decoder to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence at each decoding step, attention facilitates the alignment between source and target elements and helps in managing longrange dependencies that are challenging for traditional recurrent neural networks [6].  

Early Seq2Seq models frequently employed Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or LSTMs/GRUs in their encoder and decoder components. However, Transformer-based architectures have become dominant due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies more effectively and parallelize computation, leading to improvements in both accuracy and speed compared to recurrent models. Transformer models, incorporating self-attention and feed-forward layers, have demonstrated superior performance across various sequence generation tasks [15,20]. For example, mBART leverages sequence-to-sequence learning with a multilingual denoising pre-training approach for neural machine translation, extending concepts like Translation Language Modeling (TLM) which uses masking and prediction on parallel corpora to align language representations [16]. Similarly, models like XLM leverage techniques like Masked Language Modeling (MLM) to initialize translation models built upon Transformer architectures [8].  

While the standard encoder-attention-decoder framework is prevalent, alternative architectures have emerged to address some of its limitations, particularly error propagation inherent in autoregressive decoding and the computational cost or potential misalignments associated with attention mechanisms. For instance, FastSpeech deviates from the traditional framework by using a feed-forward Transformer with a length regulator to align phoneme and mel-spectrogram sequences, eliminating the need for attention and mitigating potential misalignments [4]. Similarly, NAST-S2X utilizes a block-wise nonautoregressive decoder that directly maps input speech features to target acoustic units end-to-end, thereby avoiding intermediate text and the associated error propagation. Its linguistic and acoustic components can directly attend to the encoder to incorporate broader input speech context [6]. VALL-E also employs a combination of autoregressive (AR) and nonautoregressive (NAR) models to generate speech codec units, where the NAR model predicts codes based on previous layers' embeddings without masking [5].​  

Common challenges and limitations of conventional autoregressive sequence-to-sequence models include slow inference speed due to sequential decoding, potential issues with error propagation where mistakes in generating early tokens affect subsequent predictions, and sometimes difficulties in capturing global sequence properties. Non-autoregressive models and alternative architectures like FastSpeech and NAST-S2X aim to alleviate these issues by enabling parallel decoding and avoiding error propagation, although they may face challenges related to ensuring output fluency and quality compared to their autoregressive counterparts.​  

# 3. Key Architectures: The Rise of Transformers  

The advent of the Transformer architecture marked a significant paradigm shift in sequence modeling, fundamentally altering the landscape of Speech Language Models (SLMs) [9,15]. Departing from traditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), which process information sequentially, the Transformer introduced a purely attention-based mechanism [27]. This innovation directly addressed key limitations of previous architectures, notably their difficulty in effectively capturing long-range dependencies and inherent sequential nature hindering parallel computation [9,15,27].​  

The core of the Transformer lies in its self-attention and multi-head attention mechanisms [8,9,16]. Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different elements in the input sequence when processing any single element, regardless of their distance. This global connectivity is crucial for understanding speech, which involves dependencies spanning considerable time durations [2,27]. Multi-head attention further enhances this capability by performing multiple attention computations in parallel, allowing the model to attend to information from different representational subspaces and capture diverse features simultaneously [9]. This parallelism, coupled with attention, enables significantly faster training and inference compared to recurrent models, especially on long sequences [9,15,27].  

![](images/f76c975c03654e4715cf23bc1f2422394f1c4abc8c1d4f805f9c940e4ac320d4.jpg)  

Structurally, the original Transformer employs an encoder-decoder framework, a versatile design widely adopted for sequence-to-sequence tasks prevalent in speech processing [9,15,20,27]. The encoder processes the input sequence (e.g., acoustic features) into a context-rich representation, which the decoder then uses to generate the target sequence (e.g., text transcript, translated speech units) [6,9,10,20,27]. This framework forms the basis for various SLMs, including those designed for speech recognition, speech translation, and speech synthesis [4,5,6,10,20].  

Beyond the original architecture, numerous Transformer variants have been developed and adapted specifically for speech data, accounting for its unique characteristics such as sequential structure, varying lengths, and combined acoustic and linguistic information [17]. The Conformer model, for instance, integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the Transformer framework [17]. This combination leverages the CNN's effectiveness in capturing local acoustic features with the Transformer's capacity for modeling global dependencies, proving highly effective for speech recognition [17]. Other adaptations include feed-forward Transformer variants like FastSpeech for text-to-speech, which streamline the decoding process [4], or hierarchical architectures like the Depth Transformer in Moshi for real-time dialogue processing [13]. Nonautoregressive decoding strategies in models like NAST-S2X further optimize the Transformer decoder for accelerated inference in tasks like speech-to-speech translation [6].​  

The adoption of Transformer-based architectures has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art across numerous speech tasks [27]. Their ability to handle complex dependencies and process data in parallel has enabled the training of much larger and more powerful models, leading to improvements in accuracy, robustness, and efficiency in speech recognition, translation, and synthesis [4,5,6,10,20,27]. Furthermore, their success has paved the way for large-scale, multilingual models like Whisper and the application of Transformer-based LLMs to speech-related tasks, demonstrating strong zeroshot and cross-lingual transfer capabilities [5,10,16,26].  

# 3.1 Self-Attention and Multi-Head Attention in Speech  

Self-attention and multi-head attention are fundamental mechanisms underlying the success of Transformer-based Speech Language Models (SLMs). The self-attention mechanism allows a model to dynamically focus on different parts of an input sequence, thereby better capturing contextual information across varying distances within the sequence [9].   
Mathematically, the core of scaled dot-product self-attention involves computing attention scores based on queries (\(Q\)), $\mathsf { k e y s } ( \mathsf { \backslash ( K ) } )$ , and values $( \backslash ( \mathsf { V } ) )$ derived from the input representation. The score for attending to position $\backslash ( \mathfrak { j } \backslash )$ from position \ $( \mathsf { i } \backslash )$ is calculated as the dot product of the query vector at position $\langle ( \mathsf { i } \backslash )$ and the key vector at position $\backslash ( \mathfrak { j } \backslash )$ . These scores are then scaled by the square root of the dimension of the keys $( \backslash ( \backslash \mathsf { s q r t } \{ \mathsf { d \_ k } \} \backslash ) )$ and passed through a softmax function to obtain attention weights, which are used to compute a weighted sum of the value vectors. The output for a given position is then the sum of value vectors weighted by these attention scores. This process can be represented in matrix form as:   
$\mathrm { A t t e n t i o n } ( Q , K , V ) = \mathrm { s o f t m a x } \left( { \frac { Q K ^ { T } } { \sqrt { d _ { k } } } } \right) V$   
While [9] describes the functional benefits of this mechanism, the above formula represents its standard mathematical structure within the Transformer architecture.  

Building upon self-attention, multi-head attention enhances the model's capacity by performing the attention function multiple times in parallel [9]. Each "head" learns different linear projections of the queries, keys, and values, allowing the model to jointly attend to information from different representational subspaces at different positions [8,9]. The outputs from these multiple heads are then concatenated and linearly transformed to produce the final result. This parallel processing enables the model to capture diverse features from different perspectives within the sequence, increasing its expressive power [9].​  

A key contribution of attention mechanisms in Transformer-based SLMs is their ability to model long-range dependencies, which is crucial for understanding speech that unfolds over time [27]. Unlike traditional recurrent or convolutional neural networks that process sequences sequentially or within limited local windows, the attention mechanism allows direct interaction between any two positions in the input sequence, regardless of their distance [27]. This global connectivity is particularly effective for capturing relationships between distant speech segments, mirroring how the human brain integrates contextual information over time [2]. For instance, in cross-lingual speech understanding, self-attention enables capturing relationships between different parts of the input speech sequence, helping to map different languages into a similar semantic space [10].​  

Furthermore, research indicates that the attention weights learned by these models can align with linguistic structures. A study analyzing self-attention weights in Transformer networks demonstrated that these weights, representing the model's focus, exhibit increasing alignment with long-range contextual structures defined at phonemic and syllabic levels as the network depth increases [2]. This alignment was observed even in self-supervised models trained without explicit linguistic labels, suggesting that the attention mechanism implicitly learns representations sensitive to speech's hierarchical structure [2]. The degree of this alignment was found to correlate with the model's ability to predict brain activity in the auditory cortex, providing an interesting parallel between artificial and biological speech processing [2].​  

While the core attention mechanism is standard, specific applications in speech processing leverage or adapt attention in unique ways. In models like NAST-S2X, attention mechanisms allow linguistic and acoustic components to directly attend to the encoder output, enabling the incorporation of broader input speech information such as rhythm, pitch, and energy beyond basic spectral features [6]. Similarly, the feed-forward transformer block (FFT block) in FastSpeech utilizes selfattention to model relationships within phoneme and mel-spectrogram sequences [4].  

# 3.2 Encoder-Decoder Architectures for Speech Tasks  

The encoder-decoder architecture constitutes a fundamental framework in sequence-to-sequence modeling, widely applied across various speech-related tasks. In this structure, the encoder is designed to process the input sequence, transforming it into a compressed feature representation or hidden state [9,27]. Subsequently, the decoder utilizes this representation to generate the target output sequence [9,27].​  

This architectural paradigm is particularly prevalent in tasks such as speech translation and speech recognition. For instance, in speech translation, the encoder processes the input speech signal, and the decoder generates the corresponding translated text [10]. Similarly, end-to-end speech-to-speech translation systems employ a speech encoder to process source speech and a decoder to generate the translated target speech signal or discrete units [20]. The Transformer architecture itself, comprising an encoder and a decoder, has been extensively adopted for machine translation, a task structurally similar to text-based sequence generation common after speech recognition or as an intermediate step in speech translation [8]. Models like mBART also utilize this structure for text tasks involving language understanding and generation, where an encoder processes masked input and a decoder reconstructs the original sequence, using elements like language ID tokens to guide generation [16]. While models like FastSpeech represent deviations by adopting feedforward structures without the distinct encoder-decoder pairing of attention-based sequence-to-sequence models [4], the core encoder-decoder design remains a cornerstone for many generative speech applications.​  

The information flow within this architecture typically involves the encoder processing the entire input sequence (e.g., speech frames) to produce a context-rich encoding. This encoding is then passed to the decoder, which generates the output sequence (e.g., text tokens, discrete speech units) element by element or as a whole. The decoder leverages the encoded representation to condition its generation process, ensuring that the output sequence is semantically consistent with the input and follows the desired structure or language [9,10,20,27]. For example, in Whisper's application to speech translation, the interaction between the encoder and decoder facilitates zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, improving performance across various language pairs based on shared representations [10].​  

Specific model implementations demonstrate variations in encoder and decoder design and decoding strategies. NAST-S2X, designed for speech-to-speech translation, employs an acoustic encoder based on causal convolutions and Transformer layers to process the input speech [6]. Its decoder, composed of stacked linguistic and acoustic components, generates the target speech [6]. Crucially, NAST-S2X utilizes non-autoregressive decoding, a departure from traditional autoregressive methods that generate output tokens sequentially [6]. Non-autoregressive decoding aims to generate the entire output sequence simultaneously or in parallel segments, significantly accelerating inference compared to sequential generation. In contrast, some speech-to-speech models utilize discrete unit decoders that generate sequences of discrete units based on semantic representations derived from the speech encoder [20]. These variations highlight the flexibility of the encoderdecoder paradigm and the ongoing research into optimizing decoder mechanisms for efficiency and output quality across diverse speech tasks.​

This section surveys advanced models and learning paradigms that are driving progress in Speech Language Models (SLMs). It begins by examining bio-inspired approaches, such as models that unify speech and text processing by drawing insights from human cognitive architectures [1] and investigations into the parallels between AI model representations and the biological auditory pathway [2]. A significant focus is placed on cross-lingual models, detailing various architectures, multilingual pre-training objectives like Masked Language Modeling and denoising autoencoding [8,16], strategies for handling multilingual datasets, and unsupervised cross-lingual techniques for tasks like offensive speech detection [3]. The discussion then shifts to the advantages and techniques employed in end-to-end models, including their application in realtime processing [6,11,13], direct speech-to-text translation [24], and speech-to-speech translation [5,6,10,20]. The section also explores the growing field of multimodal SLMs, which integrate speech with other data types to enable richer  

interactions [5,7,18]. Finally, advanced learning strategies pertinent to SLMs are discussed, including few-shot learning techniques crucial for low-resource settings and cross-task generalization [29], and the development of reasoning capabilities in large language models through prompting [28].  

# 4.1 Bio-inspired Speech Language Models  

Drawing inspiration from biological systems, particularly the human brain, has emerged as a valuable avenue for advancing speech language models. One notable approach, exemplified by the Chimera model, posits that unified processing of speech and text modalities can mirror human cognitive functions. The Chimera model is designed to extract core semantic information from both audio and text inputs without requiring explicit differentiation between these modalities. In addition, its design aligns with neurological theories suggesting that while the initial processing of speech and text occurs separately, their understanding ultimately converges in brain regions such as Wernicke’s area. [1]​  

Beyond specific architectural designs like Chimera, research also investigates the extent to which existing artificial intelligence models—particularly deep neural networks for speech processing—exhibit internal representations analogous to neural activity in the human auditory pathway. Such studies propose that understanding the similarities between AI models and the auditory pathway could inform the development of computational models for language-related cognitive functions. A key focus involves analyzing the hierarchical structure of end-to-end speech pre-training networks and comparing it to the known organization of the biological auditory pathway, which spans from the auditory nerve (AN) to the inferior colliculus (IC) and the superior temporal gyrus (STG). [2]​  

Findings from this research indicate that the self-attention mechanism, commonly employed in modern deep learning architectures, plays a significant role in explaining the representational similarity observed between self-supervised deep speech models and the brain’s auditory pathway. The dynamic extraction of speech context information facilitated by selfattention appears to capture aspects of how the brain processes sequential auditory input. While the extent to which current AI models fully capture the complexity of biological neural computation—including non-linear processing and a complete hierarchical organization across all levels—remains an active area of research, the demonstrated similarities in representational spaces and the proposed functional correspondence of mechanisms like self-attention suggest that bioinspiration offers valuable insights both for designing more human-like AI models and for using AI models as tools to understand neural processes. Neural encoding models are often employed in this context to quantitatively compare neural activity or fMRI signals with the internal activations of deep learning models, thereby assessing the degree of correspondence and predicting brain responses to speech stimuli. [2]  

# 4.2 Cross-Lingual Speech Language Models  

Cross-lingual models represent a significant advancement in enabling language technologies to function across multiple languages, often leveraging knowledge from resource-rich languages to support those with fewer available data. Different approaches have been developed for cross-lingual processing [8,16]. Prominent among these are transformer-based architectures pre-trained on massive multilingual corpora.  

Models like XLM, XLM-R, and mBART exemplify different strategies for achieving cross-lingual capabilities through multilingual pre-training [16]. XLM, built upon the BERT architecture, incorporates a shared sub-word vocabulary constructed using Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to enhance the alignment of embeddings across languages [8,16]. It is trained using a combination of Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Translation Language Modeling (TLM) objectives; while MLM is an unsupervised task, TLM utilizes parallel corpora for supervised learning [16]. To mitigate the imbalance between resource-rich and low-resource languages during training, XLM employs a sampling probability mechanism where the frequency of sampling languages with fewer examples is increased. This probability $q _ { i } = \frac { \bar { p } _ { i } ^ { \alpha } } { \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { N } p _ { j } ^ { \alpha } }$ with pi​ = $p _ { i } = \frac { n _ { i } } { \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { N } n _ { k } }$ ​ where $\mathsf { \backslash } ( \mathsf { n } _ { - } \mathsf { i } \backslash )$ is the number of sentences in language $\mathsf { \backslash } ( \mathsf { C } _ { - } \mathsf { i } \backslash )$ , and \(\alpha\) is a smoothing factor, typically set to $ { \lvert { ( 0 . 5 \backslash ) } \rvert }$ for XLM [16].​  

XLM-R represents an evolution of XLM, scaling up the approach by increasing the number of supported languages and the volume of training data to over 2TB of pre-processed CommonCrawl data [16]. Unlike XLM, XLM-R primarily relies on a multilingual MLM objective and uses a different smoothing factor, setting $\backslash ( \backslash a \vert \mathsf { p h a } = 0 . 3 \backslash )$ ) for language sampling [16]. mBART, on the other hand, adapts the BART architecture for multilingual contexts, utilizing a denoising autoencoding objective during pre-training, which involves masking tokens and permuting sentences for reconstruction [16].  

The efficacy of these cross-lingual models is often evaluated on standard benchmarks. For instance, XLM achieved state-ofthe-art performance on the XNLI dataset for cross-lingual classification across 15 languages, demonstrating its ability to transfer knowledge effectively [8].  

Training on diverse datasets, particularly those containing low-resource languages, presents significant challenges. Beyond the sampling strategies used in models like XLM and XLM-R to balance data representation, other techniques are explored for cross-lingual adaptation, especially in unsupervised settings. For tasks like cross-lingual offensive speech detection without labeled data for low-resource languages, unsupervised methods are employed to align embeddings [3]. These methods may involve initializing word representations using models like BERT, followed by techniques such as adversarial training and Procrustes analysis to map monolingual embeddings into a unified shared space [3]. Furthermore, strategies like agreement regularized training and sample regeneration can be utilized for low-resource data augmentation, considering both low-resource and rich-resource languages to improve model performance [3].​  

Cross-lingual models also find application in initializing models for downstream tasks such as machine translation. Models like XLM can be used to initialize machine translation models, which has shown a positive impact on performance metrics like BLEU scores [8].  

Beyond general language understanding, cross-lingual approaches are applied in various speech-specific domains. VALL-E X, an extension of VALL-E, incorporates a language ID to enable zero-shot cross-lingual Text-to-Speech (TTS) and speech-tospeech translation, specifically addressing challenges like foreign accents in cross-lingual TTS [5]. Similarly, models like Whisper have been studied for their zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capabilities in speech translation, demonstrating generalization to low-resource languages not seen during pre-training through fine-tuning strategies [10]. Investigations into the language specificity learned by deep neural networks using cross-lingual comparisons suggest that while low-level acoustic processing is largely cross-lingual, higher-level language-specific contextual information is acquired by selfsupervised models, exhibiting correlation with human brain activity in the auditory cortex [2]. These diverse applications highlight the versatility and ongoing development of cross-lingual techniques in speech and language modeling.  

# 4.3 End-to-End Models and Their Advancements  

End-to-end architectures have revolutionized speech language models by simplifying traditional multi-stage pipelines and mitigating issues such as error propagation and processing delays inherent in cascaded systems [6,20]. This approach consolidates multiple components into a single model, streamlining training and reducing the need for manual feature engineering or intermediate representations [5,21,23]. For instance, end-to-end deep learning systems for speech recognition directly map speech signals to text, improving accuracy, speed, and real-time performance [21]. Similarly, endto-end text-to-speech models, like Baidu's Deep Voice, simplify synthesis by utilizing deep learning across all components, enabling real-time speech generation with reduced training complexity [23].​  

A significant focus within end-to-end model development is achieving efficient real-time processing. Techniques are being explored to balance accuracy, latency, and computational cost for live speech applications. Moshi, an end-to-end model designed for real-time dialogue and full-duplex communication, achieves an actual latency of $2 0 0 \mathsf { m } \mathsf { s }$ by modeling user and system speech as separate audio token streams and incorporating an "Inner Monologue" mechanism for improved language quality [13]. Whispy demonstrates how existing models like Whisper can be adapted for real-time conditions through architectural optimizations. This adaptation maintains low computational costs while delivering high-quality, coherent transcriptions from live audio streams, exhibiting strong performance in terms of robustness, promptness, and accuracy [11].​  

End-to-end models also facilitate direct speech-to-text translation and speech-to-speech translation, bypassing the traditional intermediate steps of automatic speech recognition (ASR) followed by machine translation (MT), or ASR, MT, and text-to-speech (TTS). Direct neural network models translate speech directly into text, simplifying the pipeline by eliminating intermediate stages like phoneme recognition [24]. End-to-end speech-to-speech translation models, such as NAST-S2X [6] and a Transformer-based Tibetan–Chinese S2UT model [20], directly map input speech to target speech, effectively mitigating the error propagation issues common in cascaded systems. Whisper exemplifies an end-to-end model capable of direct speech translation, demonstrating generalization capabilities for languages not explicitly seen during pretraining [10]. Furthermore, unified multitask models like VioLA integrate ASR, MT, TTS, and speech translation within a single end-to-end decoder language model framework, simplifying the pipeline across multiple speech-related tasks [5].  

Multimodal end-to-end models represent another advancement, enabling integrated speech interaction capabilities. MiniOmni is presented as an end-to-end speech dialogue model that supports direct speech input and streaming speech output without relying on separate ASR or TTS modules [7]. It employs a text-speech co-generation approach, where text tokens guide speech token generation, simplifying speech reasoning learning and facilitating real-time voice interaction [7]. The model utilizes a multi-stage training strategy to transfer speech interaction capabilities to existing language models with minimal additional parameters [7]. Interestingly, research has also explored the structural similarities between end-to-end speech pre-training networks, such as HuBERT, and the hierarchical organization found in the human auditory pathway [2].  

While the provided digests highlight significant progress in end-to-end model architectures, real-time performance, direct translation, and multimodal capabilities, detailed analysis of few-shot learning techniques like meta-learning for limited data scenarios or adaptation techniques such as meta-modulation for cross-task adaptation [28,29] is not available within the scope of the provided materials.​  

# 4.4 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)  

Text-only Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in processing and generating linguistic content; however, their limitation to a single modality restricts their ability to comprehend and interact with the world in a holistic manner [18]. To overcome this constraint and advance towards more generalizable artificial intelligence, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a significant area of research [18]. MLLMs integrate LLMs with encoders designed to process diverse data types, including images, audio, and video, thereby enabling cross-modal understanding and generation [18].​  

The construction of MLLMs typically involves converting various modalities into a format consumable by the language model. Encoders play a crucial role in this process, transforming raw multimodal data into vector embeddings. For instance, in the context of image processing, an image is often divided into patches, which are then processed by an image encoder to produce patch embeddings [18]. Similarly, other modalities like audio and video require specialized encoders. A key challenge is achieving semantic consistency across these different modalities within a mixed embedding space [18]. Some approaches explore mapping modalities into a unified discrete space to facilitate training a single large model [5]. Following the encoding, an adapter layer may be employed to transform the modality-specific embeddings into a format compatible with the LLM's embedding space, allowing the language model to integrate information from various sources alongside text inputs [18]. The LLM then processes this combined input to generate relevant outputs, which can include text or even other modalities.​  

Various architectural approaches exist for building MLLMs [18]:  

1. Tool-Augmented LLMs: This approach involves connecting LLMs with external, modality-specific systems. While enabling processing of different data types, these are often not considered true MLLMs because the LLM itself does not directly interpret the non-textual data. An example would be using separate speech-to-text and text-to-speech models in conjunction with an LLM to handle spoken dialogue [18].​  

2. Grafting: This popular method connects pre-trained encoders for various modalities with pre-trained LLMs. An adapter or projection layer is commonly used to align the embedding spaces of the encoder and the LLM. This approach is costeffective as it leverages existing powerful models and is prevalent in the open-source community [18].  

3. Native MLLMs (Generalist Systems): Representing the state-of-the-art, these models involve training both the encoders and the core language model jointly from scratch. This end-to-end training optimizes the interaction between modalities and the language processing unit, leading to optimal performance. However, this approach demands significant computational resources for training. Prominent examples include proprietary models like GPT-4V, Grok 1.5V, Claude 3, and Gemini [18].  

Advances in MLLMs have led to impressive capabilities across various domains. In the realm of vision-language models, models like DALL-E, CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney have shown significant progress in generating images from textual descriptions [15]. Furthermore, video synthesis has seen advancements with models such as Gen-2 and Pika, including state-of-the-art high-definition generation capabilities demonstrated by I2VGen-XL [15]. Beyond visual modalities, MLLMs are extending to speech. Mini-Omni, for example, is a multimodal model designed to handle both text and speech input and output in an end-to-end manner [7]. It leverages the language model to concurrently generate text and audio tokens, with text tokens guiding the audio generation process [7]. This architecture allows for direct reasoning on speech inputs and facilitates more natural, real-time conversational interactions, addressing key limitations of unimodal systems  

[7]. Such developments highlight the growing importance of cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities in advancing artificial intelligence [15].  

# 5. Applications of Speech Language Models  

Speech Language Models (SLMs) have emerged as transformative technologies enabling a wide array of applications that bridge the gap between human language and computing systems. These models, leveraging advancements in deep learning and large-scale neural architectures, extend beyond traditional AI by incorporating generative capabilities, allowing them to create novel speech and textual content [15]. This section provides an overview of the primary applications of SLMs, synthesizing insights from advancements in core speech processing tasks and their deployment in diverse domains.  

Significant progress has been observed in Speech Recognition (ASR), where SLMs have driven substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness. Early applications utilized Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, along with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to process acoustic features for transcription [12,25]. More recently, Transformer-based models like Whisper have demonstrated superior performance, particularly in handling long-range dependencies [27]. Adapting these powerful models for real-time environments remains an active area of research, leading to developments such as Whispy for real-time Whisper adaptation and models like Moshi designed for real-time conversational systems [11,13]. ASR is foundational for various applications, including voice assistants, smart devices, automotive systems, and specialized fields like healthcare and education [21,25].  

In Speech Translation, SLMs have facilitated advancements in achieving real-time and cross-lingual capabilities. Models like Whisper have shown remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual transfer abilities, enabling translation for languages not explicitly seen during training, which is particularly valuable for low-resource languages [10]. The field is moving towards direct Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) methods to improve efficiency and naturalness, bypassing traditional cascaded systems [20]. Specialized architectures like NAST-S2X are being developed for simultaneous speech translation, prioritizing speed and quality for applications like live interpreting [6]. Unified large speech models, including VALL-E X and VioLA, are emerging, integrating speech translation alongside other tasks within a single framework [5]. Pre-training strategies using multilingual models further enhance translation quality [8,16].​  

SLMs are central to the functionality of Voice Assistants (such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant) and other voice-enabled devices. These systems rely on the integration of NLU, dialogue management, and advanced speech generation components [23]. Improved Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis technologies, exemplified by models like Deep Voice, have significantly enhanced the naturalness and emotional expressiveness of voice assistant responses, contributing to a better user experience [23]. Models enabling real-time, full-duplex conversation and the ability to handle multimodal inputs are pushing the boundaries of interactive voice interfaces [13,18].  

The advancements in ASR directly support sophisticated Transcription Services, converting spoken audio into text [25]. Adaptation techniques, such as implementing real-time capabilities for powerful models like Whisper, are crucial for applications requiring immediate transcription, despite ongoing challenges related to noisy environments and multiple speakers [11,25].​  

Speech Synthesis (TTS) represents another core application area, focusing on generating natural and controllable humanlike speech from text. Models like FastSpeech and Baidu's Deep Voice have been instrumental in advancing TTS technology, improving attributes such as synthesis speed, robustness, controllability, naturalness, and the ability to convey emotion [4,23]. Recent large models like VALL-E X further extend capabilities to zero-shot cross-lingual TTS and personalized voice cloning [5].  

Beyond these core functionalities, SLMs find applications in Specific Domains, leveraging their generative and analytical capabilities [15]. In education, SLMs support language learning, assessment, curriculum development, and teacher professional development, while also enabling personalized tutoring and enhancing accessibility through TTS [15,22,23]. The media and entertainment industries utilize SLMs for content creation, such as generating audiobooks, aiding news reporting, and supporting film production processes [5,15]. TTS technology is particularly critical for improving accessibility for individuals with visual or reading impairments [23]. Applications also extend to healthcare (e.g., medical transcription), finance (e.g., fraud detection), and other technical and creative fields like code generation and advertising content creation [15,21].​  

While significant progress has been made across these applications, challenges persist. These include ensuring high accuracy and robustness in real-world conditions (e.g., noise, diverse accents), achieving truly low-latency and high-quality real-time interactions, supporting a vast array of languages including those with limited data, managing the computational demands of large models, addressing ethical considerations (e.g., fairness, privacy, bias), and developing frameworks for multimodal understanding and interaction [13,18,21,22,23]. Future research directions include further improving the efficiency and scalability of models, enhancing controllability and personalization in generative tasks, expanding support for under-resourced languages, and developing robust evaluation methodologies for complex, real-time, and cross-modal applications. The generative nature of SLMs, positioning them within the AIGC paradigm, offers substantial opportunities for innovation and broad societal impact.​  

# 5.1 Speech Recognition  

Speech Recognition (ASR) has seen significant advancements, largely driven by the application of deep learning models, which have substantially improved accuracy and robustness [12,25]. Early deep learning approaches utilized models such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks [12,25]. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have also been employed in ASR systems [25]. These models process acoustic features to predict sequences of phonemes or characters, with outputs often calculated through a softmax layer, such as  

$$
D N N \mathrm { O u t p u t } = \mathrm { S o f t m a x } ( D N N ( x ) )
$$  

or  

$$
L S T M \mathrm { O u t p u t } = \mathrm { S o f t m a x } ( L S T M ( x ) )
$$  

[25].  

More recently, the Transformer architecture has demonstrated notable success in speech recognition, offering advantages in capturing long-range dependencies compared to traditional RNNs and LSTMs [27]. Models based on the Transformer architecture, such as Whisper, have become prominent in the field [11]. The success of such models can be attributed to their ability to process sequences efficiently and scale with large datasets. Adapting these powerful models for practical applications, such as real-time environments, remains an active area, as exemplified by models like Whispy, which adapts the Transformer-based Whisper model for real-time speech processing [11]. Other models incorporate streaming ASR capabilities, such as Moshi [13], or integrate ASR as a specific task, as seen in VioLA which predicts ASR results from speech input and language ID [5]. ASR is also utilized as an auxiliary task within multi-task learning frameworks to enhance performance in related areas, such as improving Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) models [20].  

Performance in ASR systems is typically evaluated using various metrics. Common metrics include Accuracy, calculated as  

$$
A c c u r a c y = \frac { \mathrm { N u m b e r ~ o f ~ c o r r e c t ~ p r e d i c t i o n s } } { \mathrm { T o t a l ~ n u m b e r ~ o f ~ p r e d i c t i o n s } } ,
$$  

Recall, given by  

$$
R e c a l l = \frac { \mathrm { N u m b e r ~ o f ~ c o r r e c t ~ p o s i t i v e ~ p r e d i c t i o n s } } { \mathrm { T o t a l ~ n u m b e r ~ o f ~ p o s i t i v e ~ s a m p l e s } } ,
$$  

and the F1 Score, defined as  

$$
F 1 { \mathrm { S c o r e } } = 2 \times { \frac { { \mathrm { P r e c i s i o n } } \times { \mathrm { R e c a l l } } } { { \mathrm { P r e c i s i o n } } + { \mathrm { R e c a l l } } } }
$$  

[25]. These metrics help quantify the model's effectiveness in correctly transcribing speech.  

The widespread improvement in ASR technology has led to its extensive application across various domains. These include voice assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple Siri), smart home devices (e.g., smart speakers, smart lights), and automotive systems (e.g., voice control, navigation) [21]. Furthermore, ASR is increasingly deployed in specialized fields like healthcare for medical record dictation and diagnosis assistance, in education for online learning and tutoring, and in customer service for chatbots and voice support [21]. While significant progress has been made, enabling diverse applications, the explicit discussion of common challenges and proposed solutions based solely on the provided digest content is limited to specific model adaptations like streaming ASR and real-time processing [11,13].  

# 5.2 Speech Translation  

Speech translation, aiming to convert spoken language in a source language into either text or speech in a target language, has seen significant advancements, particularly in enabling real‐time and cross‐lingual capabilities. A key development in this domain is the move towards models capable of handling multiple languages, including low‐resource scenarios, and achieving zero‐shot performance [10]. For instance, studies utilizing the Whisper model have demonstrated zero‐shot cross‐lingual transfer for speech translation. Fine‐tuning on a specific language pair, such as English‐to‐Chinese, has been shown to yield performance improvements across other languages, highlighting the model’s capacity for generalization. This zero‐shot capability extends to performing speech translation for languages not encountered during pre‐training, underscoring its practical utility, especially in low‐resource settings where parallel speech data is scarce [10].  

Advancements also include the development of models that bypass traditional cascade systems, which typically involve sequential stages of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Machine Translation (MT), and Text‐to‐Speech (TTS). Direct speech‐to‐speech translation (S2ST) approaches are being explored to improve efficiency and naturalness. One such method involves converting source speech into discrete units using a speech‐to‐unit translation (S2UT) model, which are then translated into the target language [20]. This direct approach has been applied to specific language pairs, such as Tibetan‐to‐Chinese S2ST, demonstrating its potential to streamline the translation process compared to multi‐ component cascade systems [20].​  

Simultaneous speech translation, crucial for applications like live interpreting, presents unique challenges related to latency and quality. Specialized models are being developed to address these issues. NAST‐S2X is one such model specifically engineered for simultaneous speech translation, prioritizing high‐quality output with minimal delay [6]. This architecture is adaptable for both simultaneous interpreting scenarios and offline translation tasks, indicating its versatility [6].  

Furthermore, progress in large speech models has led to unified architectures supporting multiple speech processing tasks, including speech translation. Models like VALL-E X support zero‐shot cross‐lingual TTS and zero‐shot speech‐to‐ speech translation [5]. Similarly, VioLA is presented as a unified model that includes speech translation among its capabilities [5]. These unified models aim to provide versatile solutions across various speech‐related tasks within a single framework. Research also explores neural models inspired by cognitive processes, such as the Chimera model, for translating source language audio directly into target language text with the objective of surpassing the quality of existing translation models [1].  

Underpinning some of these advancements are foundational language models and pre‐training strategies. For example, multilingual models like mBART—pre‐trained using objectives such as token masking and sentence permutation to reconstruct the original input—are applied and fine‐tuned for downstream multilingual tasks like sentence and document translation [16]. Masked Language Model (MLM) pre‐training, similar to that used in models like BERT and XLM, has been shown to improve translation quality, reportedly by as much as 3 BLEU points when used for initializing translation models [8]. While challenges remain in achieving truly seamless, high‐quality, and low‐latency simultaneous translation across all language pairs and conditions, the development of specialized simultaneous translation models, direct S2ST methods, and models leveraging large‐scale pre‐training signifies substantial progress. The emphasis on zero‐shot and cross‐ lingual capabilities directly addresses the challenge of supporting a wide array of languages, including those with limited data resources.​  

# 5.3 Voice Assistants and Voice-Enabled Devices  

Speech language models (SLMs) play a pivotal role in enabling the functionality of modern voice assistants and voiceenabled devices. The core capabilities of these systems are fundamentally reliant on the integration and performance of natural language understanding (NLU), dialogue management, and speech generation components [23]. NLU allows the system to interpret user commands and queries, while dialogue management handles the conversational flow, enabling complex interactions beyond simple command recognition. Speech generation, specifically text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, provides the voice interface through which the system responds.  

Advances in speech generation technology, such as Deep Voice, have significantly contributed to enhancing the user experience by producing more realistic and emotionally expressive speech [23]. This improved naturalness is crucial for user engagement and satisfaction with voice interfaces. Functionality is further extended by sophisticated NLU and dialogue capabilities that allow voice assistants to handle diverse and complex tasks, such as identifying and providing information about multimodal input (e.g., describing a new dish encountered while traveling) [18]. Systems designed for real-time interaction, like Moshi, demonstrate the potential for voice assistants to handle full-duplex conversations with low latency, offering a more fluid and natural interactive experience suitable for seamless integration into various voice-enabled devices [13].​  

Comparing the performance of different voice assistants involves assessing metrics such as accuracy, naturalness, and task handling capability [21,23]. While advancements in synthesis contribute to perceived naturalness [23], overall performance heavily depends on the accuracy of upstream speech recognition and the robustness of NLU and dialogue systems in interpreting and executing user requests. The effectiveness of task handling relies on the model's ability to accurately understand context and intent across various domains [18,21].  

Despite significant progress, building robust and accurate SLMs for voice assistants presents several challenges [21]. Achieving high accuracy in speech recognition remains difficult, particularly in noisy environments or with diverse accents and speaking styles [21]. Advanced synthesis technologies like Deep Voice, while improving naturalness, may impose substantial processing requirements that current devices are not fully equipped to handle efficiently [23]. Furthermore, ensuring low latency for real-time, full-duplex conversation is a critical challenge for enabling natural and instantaneous interactions [13]. Developing models that can seamlessly integrate multimodal inputs and handle the breadth of potential user queries and tasks in real-world scenarios also requires continuous effort [18].  

# 5.4 Transcription Services  

Automatic transcription, the process of converting spoken language into text, represents a fundamental application domain for Speech Language Models (SLMs). These models leverage sophisticated neural architectures to process audio inputs and generate corresponding textual outputs, forming the core technology behind various transcription services [25]. A significant area of advancement within this field involves adapting foundational SLMs for practical, real-time applications. For instance, Whispy demonstrates an approach to bringing live capabilities to the Whisper model, thereby enhancing its applicability in scenarios requiring immediate transcription outputs [11]. This adaptation exemplifies the ongoing optimization efforts aimed at improving the performance and utility of SLMs for transcription, which also encompass addressing challenges such as noisy environments and the presence of multiple speakers [25].  

# 5.5 SLMs in Specific Domains  

Speech Language Models (SLMs), as a specialized form of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), are increasingly being applied across diverse domains, fundamentally changing how humans interact with and create content [15]. Unlike traditional AI systems that primarily focus on predicting outputs based on existing data, AIGC, and by extension generative SLMs, are designed to create novel data instances, such as new speech, text, or multimodal content [15]. This generative capability unlocks significant opportunities for automating, enhancing, and personalizing applications in various fields.  

In the realm of education, SLMs and related AI technologies offer transformative potential [15,22,23]. Applications include assisting in course design and generating content for student reports [15]. Text-to-speech (TTS) technology, a core component of SLMs, is integral for creating accessible educational materials and facilitating the development of convenience-designed learning devices [23]. Furthermore, AI is poised to impact English language education comprehensively, influencing pedagogy, assessment methodologies, teacher professional development, and curriculum design, including specific areas like English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI) and Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) [22]. The potential for personalized tutoring through AIGC highlights an opportunity to tailor learning experiences to individual student needs [15].​  

The media and entertainment industries are also leveraging SLMs for enhanced content creation and delivery. AIGC applications in media include aiding in news reporting and enabling virtual host broadcasting [15]. In the film industry, SLMs can support script processing, while in music and painting, they facilitate automated content generation [15]. A notable application in entertainment is the creation of audiobooks, exemplified by the use of models like VALL-E to generate narration for publications [5]. This demonstrates the ability of SLMs to produce long-form audio content efficiently.  

SLMs significantly contribute to improving accessibility [23]. TTS technology is a foundational tool for providing auditory access to text-based information for individuals with visual impairments or reading difficulties [23]. Advanced SLM capabilities, such as Microsoft's personal voice cloning technology supporting Cross-Lingual Zero-shot TTS generation across 100 languages, represent a significant step towards breaking down language barriers and providing personalized, multilingual accessibility solutions [5].​  

Beyond these core areas, AIGC, encompassing generative text and speech capabilities, finds applications in diverse technica and creative fields [15]. This includes code generation in computer science and the automated creation of advertising  

content and logos [15]. The potential extends to niche areas like game customization and even exploring concepts such as digital immortality through synthesized voices and personalities [15].  

Opportunities for deploying SLMs in these domains stem from their ability to generate diverse and novel content, enabling greater automation, personalization, and reach. However, challenges exist, including ethical considerations, particularly highlighted in the context of AI-driven education regarding fairness, privacy, and the role of human educators [22]. While the provided digests focus primarily on applications, broader deployment challenges often include ensuring accuracy, robustness, controlling bias in generated content, and developing appropriate regulatory frameworks. Nonetheless, the generative nature of SLMs presents a powerful opportunity to innovate and enhance human endeavors across a wide spectrum of applications.​

The advancement of speech language models (SLMs) has been significant, yet numerous fundamental challenges persist, driving the need for ongoing research and innovation. A prominent issue is data scarcity, which disproportionately affects the development of models for low-resource languages. The limited availability of high-quality speech data, particularly parallel corpora essential for tasks like speech translation, impedes performance and generalization capabilities [1,20,25]. For instance, the development of Tibetan–Chinese speech translation systems is constrained by this lack of resources [20]. While collecting large, high-quality labeled datasets is a direct remedy, it is often prohibitive [15]. Current strategies to mitigate data scarcity include leveraging cross-lingual transfer through models like XLM and XLM-R, utilizing shared vocabularies and sampling techniques [8,16], exploring zero-shot capabilities [10], and employing data-efficient learning paradigms such as unsupervised learning (e.g., for offensive speech detection) [3], self-supervised learning [20], and multitask learning [20].​  

Another critical challenge is the substantial computational complexity inherent in large SLMs [26]. The intensive computational demands create a high research barrier and limit deployment on devices with constrained resources [15,23,25]. Addressing this necessitates improving efficiency in both training and inference [21]. Research explores nonautoregressive architectures to enhance parallelism, leading to significant speedups in tasks like speech synthesis and simultaneous translation [4,6]. Hierarchical modeling and specialized architectures are also investigated to efficiently handle long audio sequences required for real-time dialogue systems [13]. Further efforts involve optimizing existing architectures [11], applying model compression techniques [28,29], and developing models viable in "three medium" environments (medium parameters, data, and computing resources) [15]. A key challenge in real-time scenarios remains the trade-off between minimizing latency and maintaining high output quality, as reducing block sizes can introduce artifacts [6].​  

Robustness to noise and variability in acoustic input remains a significant hurdle [12,21,25]. SLMs need to perform reliably despite background sounds, reverberation, and diverse speaking styles, accents, or dialects [21,25]. Approaches to improve robustness include signal processing techniques like noise cancellation and audio enhancement [21], architectural designs that prevent error propagation [4], applying regularization to models [28], and developing multi-language models to handle linguistic diversity [21]. Achieving high robustness is recognized as a key performance indicator for modern systems [11].  

Ethical considerations are increasingly paramount in SLM development and deployment [15,19]. Concerns include data privacy, intellectual property, the potential for generating harmful content, and, significantly, technical bias [15]. Bias, including gender bias, is a critical area of focus [19]. Researchers employ metrics such as Equalized odds and Error Rate Equality Difference to quantify bias [19]. The SUM-ED metric, calculated as the sum of False Positive Equality Difference (FPED) and False Negative Equality Difference (FNED), serves to summarize error rate differences across groups:​  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { F P E D = \displaystyle \sum _ { g \in G } \vert F P R _ { d } - F P R \vert } } \\ { { { } } } \\ { { F N E D = \displaystyle \sum _ { t \in T } \vert F N R - F N R _ { t } \vert } } \end{array}
$$  

where $G$ denotes gender categories, $d$ a specific gender group, and $t$ a target group type [19]. Studies using these metrics suggest some models may exhibit relatively low gender bias, potentially due to inherent mechanisms or explicit feature provision [19]. Responsible development necessitates analyzing bias sources, developing mitigation techniques, ensuring data privacy, and preventing misuse of generative capabilities [15].​  

Achieving naturalness and expressiveness, particularly emotional nuances, in synthesized speech remains challenging [23]. While systems like Deep Voice can manipulate features to express emotions [23], fully replicating human emotional complexity is difficult. Some high-fidelity zero-shot generation systems may lack the strong expressiveness of human voices [5], and controlling prosody often still relies on explicit prompts [5]. Enhancing the ability to intrinsically model and generate spontaneous emotional prosody is an ongoing research area [13,23]. Beyond these, general challenges include factual and logical errors, limited reasoning, inadequate world understanding, difficulty with common sense and planning [26], lack of control over generated content, unstable performance [15], the need for robust content detection/evaluation [15], integrating explicit linguistic knowledge, and improving domain-specific adaptation [20].​  

Promising future research directions aim to address these open challenges. Exploring bio-inspired architectures and parallels with human brain processing may offer insights into building more capable models [1,2,26]. A key direction is the integration of SLMs with other modalities to move beyond text limitations and enable models to interact more comprehensively with the world [18]. This includes unifying speech and text processing, potentially in shared representation spaces [1], integrating video with speech [5,12], enhancing robustness through multimodal data [19], enriching conversational experiences [13], and developing cross-modal recognition systems [21,25]. Advancing data-efficient paradigms such as unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot learning remains crucial to reduce reliance on extensive labeled data and improve adaptability to new tasks and languages [5,21,25,28,29]. Efforts continue to develop more efficient algorithms and push towards purely end-to-end solutions, optimizing parallel processing for low latency [4,6,13]. Improving semantic understanding [12,21], ensuring security and interpretability [21], exploring combinations of different language models [8], investigating Codec-based models [5], incorporating real-time feedback [19], and conducting targeted research for specific domains [15,22] also represent promising avenues. Proactive bias detection and mitigation are vital future steps for responsible AI development [19]. Collectively, these challenges and prospective directions define the frontier of research in speech language models, emphasizing the need for innovations spanning data efficiency, model architecture, robustness, ethical governance, and multimodal integration.  

# 6.1 Data Scarcity and Low-Resource Languages  

A significant challenge in the development of advanced speech language models, particularly for languages with limited digital resources, is data scarcity [1]. Compared to text data, the availability of high-quality speech data, especially parallel corpora required for tasks like speech translation, is considerably lower [1]. This challenge is particularly acute for lowresource languages, where existing datasets are minimal or non-existent [20]. For instance, Tibetan–Chinese speech translation is hampered by the limited parallel data resources available for Tibetan [20]. The scarcity of data directly impacts model performance, leading to degraded accuracy and generalization capabilities.​  

To address the detrimental effects of data scarcity, particularly for low-resource languages, various techniques have been explored. One prominent approach involves leveraging cross-lingual capabilities. Cross-lingual models can utilize data from resource-rich languages to improve performance on low-resource languages, especially when the languages are related [8]. Techniques like shared sub-word vocabularies (e.g., Byte Pair Encoding – BPE) [8] and sampling strategies that increase the frequency of languages with fewer training examples are employed to facilitate cross-lingual transfer during pre-training [16]. Models like XLM and XLM-R have demonstrated the efficacy of such strategies by scaling up the number of languages and the size of the training dataset to enhance multilingual representation [16]. Furthermore, studies have shown that models like Whisper can perform speech translation for languages unseen during pre-training, highlighting the potential of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer as a mitigation strategy for data scarcity in low-resource settings [10].​  

Beyond leveraging data from other languages, methods that reduce reliance on large quantities of labeled data are crucial. Unsupervised learning techniques offer a pathway by not requiring labeled examples [3]. Specific methods such as adversarial learning, Procrustes analysis, agreement regularized training, and sample regeneration have been utilized within unsupervised frameworks to mitigate the impact of data scarcity in tasks like cross-lingual offensive speech detection [3]. Another effective strategy is self-supervised learning (SSL), which allows models to learn useful representations from abundant unlabeled data [20]. For instance, SSL has been employed in Tibetan–Chinese speech translation to make better use of limited resources [20]. Multi-task learning can also enhance model performance with limited data by enabling the model to learn shared representations across related tasks [20].  

Collectively, these techniques—including cross-lingual training, unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning, and multitask learning—represent efforts to achieve reasonable model performance while reducing the substantial data cost associated with collecting and annotating large-scale parallel corpora for every low-resource language. While acquiring highquality labeled data remains a direct method to reduce the need for super-large datasets and parameters [15], the aforementioned methods offer practical avenues to build capable models despite data scarcity by strategically leveraging existing resources or learning from unlabeled data. The trade-off involves balancing the performance achievable with these data-efficient methods against the potentially higher performance attainable with vast amounts of high-quality labeled data, the latter often being economically and logistically prohibitive for low-resource languages.​  

# 6.2 Computational Complexity and Model Efficiency  

A significant challenge in the advancement and deployment of large speech language models (SLMs) lies in their substantial computational complexity [26]. The high demand for computational resources poses a considerable research threshold [15], making it difficult for current devices to process the requirements of complex models [23]. Addressing this limitation is crucial for enabling wider accessibility and real-time applications.​  

Various techniques are being explored to improve the efficiency of SLMs for both training and deployment. A prominent approach involves moving away from purely autoregressive architectures, which process data sequentially, towards models that allow for increased parallelism. For instance, FastSpeech employs a feed-forward architecture that enables parallel computation, yielding substantial speedups compared to autoregressive Transformer TTS, specifically reporting a 270x speedup in mel-spectrogram generation and a 38x speedup in end-to-end audio synthesis [4]. Similarly, NAST-S2X tackles computational complexity by utilizing a non-autoregressive decoder. This architectural choice results in significant speed improvements in offline scenarios, demonstrating a 28.3x speedup over the S2UT baseline and a $1 7 . 7 \times$ speedup compared to UnitY [6].​  

Efficiency is also critical for handling long sequences, especially in conversational AI where maintaining context over several minutes is necessary. Moshi addresses this by employing a hierarchical autoregressive modeling approach combined with an RQ-Transformer. This method effectively reduces the computational cost associated with modeling extensive audio sequences, allowing the model to handle up to 5 minutes of audio context, which is vital for facilitating coherent real-time dialogue [13].​  

Beyond architectural redesigns, other strategies contribute to improving model efficiency. Efforts are underway to optimize existing model architectures specifically for real-time processing requirements [11]. Model compression techniques, such as  

Compressing Deep Neural Networks with Sparse Matrix Factorization, are also relevant for reducing the computational footprint of SLMs [28,29]. Furthermore, there is an advocacy for developing methods that achieve excellent performance in "three medium" environments—medium-sized parameters, medium-sized data, and medium-sized computing resources— to lower the overall research and deployment threshold [15]. These combined strategies are essential for making advanced speech language models practical and accessible for a wider range of applications, particularly those requiring low-latency real-time processing.​  

# 6.3 Robustness and Variability  

Speech language models face significant challenges from noise and variability in acoustic input, which can severely impact performance [12,21]. Addressing these issues is crucial for developing robust and generalizable systems. Various techniques have been explored to enhance the resilience of models against adverse conditions and diverse speaking characteristics.  

One primary approach involves mitigating the effects of environmental noise and audio distortions. This includes the application of noise cancellation algorithms and audio enhancement algorithms, which preprocess the speech signal to improve its quality before it is fed into the model [21]. These methods aim to isolate the target speech from interfering sounds, thereby reducing the variability introduced by the recording environment.  

Beyond signal processing, architectural and training-based methods are also critical for improving robustness. Regularization techniques for deep neural networks (DNNs) have been investigated to enhance their robustness [28]. Such regularization methods often aim to make the model less sensitive to small perturbations in the input data, which can stem from noise or variations in speech. Furthermore, designing models that inherently avoid issues like error propagation can contribute to robustness. For instance, in text-to-speech synthesis, FastSpeech enhances robustness by preventing the error accumulation and attention misalignment typical of autoregressive models, leading to improved intelligibility and reduced artifacts like word skipping or repeating [4].​  

Handling variability arising from different accents, speaking styles, and languages is another key aspect of robustness. The development of multi-language models is a strategy employed to address linguistic diversity [21]. These models are trained on data encompassing multiple languages and accents, enabling them to generalize better across different user populations. While the digests primarily mention multi-language models, techniques like data augmentation (generating variations of existing data by adding noise, reverberation, speed perturbation, etc.), adversarial training (training the model on adversarially perturbed examples), and domain adaptation (adapting a model trained on one domain to perform well on another) are standard practices in the field to improve generalization across various acoustic conditions and speaker characteristics, although specific details of their application were not provided in the included digests.  

Ultimately, achieving high levels of robustness is a key performance indicator for modern speech systems, with some models specifically noted for their robustness capabilities [11]. The ongoing research in noise reduction, signal enhancement, model regularization, and architecture design, coupled with strategies for handling linguistic variability, continues to drive advancements in building more reliable speech language models [4,21,28].  

# 6.4 Ethical Considerations  

The rapid advancement of speech language models (SLMs) necessitates a thorough examination of associated ethical considerations, encompassing issues of bias, fairness, and privacy [15,19]. Beyond technical performance, the potential for these models to generate discriminatory, violent, or illegal content poses significant ethical challenges, alongside concerns related to data privacy, intellectual property rights, and the responsible development and moral use of the technology [15]. Technical bias itself is a critical area of concern [15].​  

Addressing bias is crucial for ensuring fairness in SLM applications. Research has specifically investigated gender bias in the behavior detection capabilities of models like ChatGPT [19]. To quantify bias and fairness, studies employ prominent metrics such as "Equalized odds" and "Error Rate Equality Difference" [19]. A specific metric used to summarize error rate differences across groups is denoted as "SUM-ED", which is the sum of false positive equality difference (FPED) and false negative equality difference (FNED) scores [19]. These components are defined as  

$$
F P E D = \sum _ { g \in G } | F P R _ { d } - F P R |
$$  

and  

$$
F N E D = \sum _ { t \in T } | F N R - F N R _ { t } |
$$  

where G represents gender categories and d is a specific gender group (e.g., female) [19]. Analysis using these metrics suggests that some models, such as ChatGPT, exhibit a relatively low degree of gender bias, particularly when demographic attribute feature labels are explicitly provided during evaluation [19]. This finding leads to the hypothesis that models may incorporate inherent mechanisms, potentially a "built-in resistance" to sensitive information like gender, which contributes to mitigating the influence of such biases [19].  

Beyond specific biases like gender, the broad challenge of technical bias necessitates ongoing analysis of its sources and the development of techniques to mitigate its effects [15]. The responsible development of SLMs also requires diligent consideration of data privacy concerns, ensuring that the vast datasets used for training do not compromise individual privacy [15]. Furthermore, ensuring the moral use of these powerful generative models to prevent the creation and dissemination of harmful content is paramount [15]. These multifaceted ethical considerations underscore the need for continuous research and proactive measures in the development and deployment of SLMs.  

# 6.5 Emotional and Expressive Speech  

Achieving naturalness and expressiveness in synthesized speech necessitates the accurate capture and conveyance of human emotions. Significant strides have been made in this domain. For instance, systems like Deep Voice have demonstrated capabilities in expressing distinct emotions by manipulating acoustic features through techniques such as combining and switching phonemes and altering syllables [23]. This indicates progress in developing methods to imbue synthetic voices with emotional variance.  

Despite these advancements, fully replicating the intricate spectrum of human emotional nuances remains a challenge. Some zero-shot speech generation systems, while achieving high fidelity, have been noted to lack the strong expressiveness present in genuine human voice recordings, highlighting a current limitation in capturing subtle emotional qualities [5]. Furthermore, the control over prosody, which is crucial for conveying emotion, still often relies significantly on explicit prompts [5]. The ability to intrinsically model and generate spontaneous, natural-sounding emotional prosody remains an active area of research.​  

# 6.6 Open Challenges and Promising Future Research  

Despite significant advancements in speech language models (SLMs), several open challenges persist, necessitating continued research effort. A primary challenge lies in enhancing the robustness of SLMs, particularly in handling noisy environments and variability in speech patterns, which remains critical for real‐world deployment [13]. Reducing computational costs associated with training and inference, as well as improving the efficiency of algorithms, is also a crucial area for development, especially as models scale. Furthermore, challenges remain in effectively incorporating explicit linguistic knowledge into data‐driven models and in addressing issues related to data quality and adaptation, such as improving the adaptation of domain‐specific corpora [20]. Achieving low latency performance while maintaining high quality, specifically minimizing ASR-BLEU score degradation influenced by output speech waveform fragment playback timing, presents another significant challenge [6]. The need for robust content detection and evaluation methods [15], along with addressing biases related to sensitive attributes like gender or race [19], also represents important challenges for ensuring fairness and responsible AI development. Finally, equipping machines with a deeper understanding of the world, including capabilities for planning and reasoning akin to human intelligence, and tackling tasks that remain difficult for AI (Moravec’s paradox) are fundamental challenges for future progress [26].​  

Promising avenues for future research aim to address these challenges and expand the capabilities of SLMs. Exploring bioinspired architectures and drawing parallels with human brain processes are suggested to reveal underlying mechanisms and potentially lead to more capable models [1,2,26]. Mimicking the human brain’s unified understanding of speech and text could lead to models like Chimera, capable of simultaneously learning from both modalities to improve versatility in tasks like speech translation [1]. Integrating with other modalities is seen as crucial for achieving more general artificial intelligence, enabling models to observe, perceive, and listen to interact with the physical world [18]. Future work includes exploring multimodal data integration to enhance robustness [19], integrating additional modalities to enrich conversational experiences [13], and developing cross-modal speech recognition systems [21]. A potential approach involves mapping different modalities, such as speech and video, into a unified discrete space for training integrated models [5]. Advancing unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot learning paradigms is critical for reducing reliance on large labeled  

datasets and enabling models to adapt quickly to new tasks and languages [28,29]. This includes research into autonomous learning speech recognition [21] and exploring zero-shot speech generation and translation [5]. Developing more efficient algorithms and pursuing purely end-to-end solutions, such as optimizing parallel vocoders with models like FastSpeech [4], can help reduce latency further and improve real-time performance [6,13]. Future efforts also focus on enhancing the realism, emotional expressiveness, and accessibility of synthesized voices [13,23]. Other important directions include improving semantic understanding [21], ensuring the security and interpretability of speech recognition systems [21], exploring combinations of different language models [8], investigating Codec-based large language models [5], integrating real-time feedback mechanisms [19], and conducting targeted research in specific domains to improve applicability [15,22]. Addressing bias proactively through detection and mitigation strategies remains a vital research area [19].​  

# 7. Conclusion  

The field of Speech Language Models (SLMs) has undergone transformative advancements, fundamentally shifting from traditional statistical methods to deep learning paradigms. A pivotal milestone in this evolution is the advent and widespread adoption of the Transformer architecture, which revolutionized AI by enabling efficient parallel computation and superior handling of long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms, thereby overcoming limitations of prior models like RNNs and CNNs [9,27]. This architectural shift has become a cornerstone technology across numerous AI tasks [9].  

Significant progress has been achieved across various specialized domains within SLM research. Bio-inspired models, drawing parallels with human cognitive processes, have shown promise, such as studies demonstrating computational and representational similarities between AI speech networks and the human auditory pathway [2]. These studies indicate that hierarchical structures in end-to-end speech pre-training align with auditory processing hierarchies and that self-supervised models can capture brain-relevant language context [2]. Furthermore, bio-inspired approaches like the Chimera model have demonstrated the potential to unify speech and text processing, leading to enhanced performance and versatility in speech translation [1].​  

In the realm of cross-lingual understanding, models like XLM-R and XLM, building upon foundations such as BERT, have achieved state-of-the-art performance on cross-lingual classification and machine translation tasks, highlighting the power of language models and transfer learning [8,16]. Analysis of models like mBART further revealed the benefits of fine-tuning on related languages, suggesting shared characteristics within language families [16]. Multilingual foundation models like Whisper have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual transfer capabilities in speech translation, generalizing to languages unseen during pre-training and emphasizing the importance of continued research in this area [10]. Even for lowresource languages, self-supervised learning and multi-task frameworks have proven feasible for tasks like Speech-toSpeech Translation (S2ST), demonstrating promising quality despite limited data [20]. Unsupervised approaches leveraging techniques like agreement regularized training have also shown effectiveness in overcoming data scarcity for tasks such as cross-lingual offensive speech detection, achieving performance comparable to supervised methods [3].  

The pursuit of end-to-end systems has yielded notable results. In Text-to-Speech (TTS), models like FastSpeech have advanced beyond autoregressive limitations, achieving faster generation, improved robustness, and enhanced controllability through novel architectures, moving closer to purely end-to-end solutions [4]. Baidu's Deep Voice also marked a significant step with faster synthesis and reduced human interaction, albeit requiring further development for greater realism and accessibility [23]. More recently, foundation models like VALL-E and its extensions VioLA have demonstrated strong zero-shot performance in tasks spanning speech generation, translation, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) [5]. For real-time interactive applications, models such as Moshi, a speech-text foundation model, address challenges like latency and information bottlenecks, paving the way for more natural and sophisticated conversational agents [13]. Furthermore, non-autoregressive models like NAST-S2X have achieved substantial speedups in S2ST while maintaining quality comparable to state-of-the-art autoregressive counterparts, highlighting efforts to balance quality with computational efficiency for both simultaneous and offline translation scenarios [6]. Adaptation techniques, as seen with Whispy for real-time Whisper transcription, further enhance promptness and accuracy through architectural optimizations [11].​  

Multimodality is increasingly recognized as crucial for bringing machines closer to human-level understanding and enabling their interaction with the physical world [18]. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are emerging as key components of advanced generative AI, capable of processing diverse data types within a unified framework [18].​  

Despite these significant strides, the field faces persistent challenges. Data scarcity remains a hurdle, particularly for lowresource languages and specialized domains, necessitating innovative unsupervised or self-supervised learning approaches [3,20]. Computational complexity and latency are critical issues, especially for real-time applications like simultaneous interpreting, where maintaining quality at minimal latency is challenging [6,21]. Ensuring robustness against diverse acoustic conditions and variations is also vital [4]. Furthermore, ethical concerns surrounding bias, particularly in large models like ChatGPT, highlight the need for improved bias detection, mitigation strategies, and external regulatory audits to ensure fair and responsible deployment [19]. The broader societal impact of AIGC technologies, while potentially gamechanging, necessitates careful consideration of associated risks and challenges, calling for collaborative efforts among academia, industry, and policymakers to develop appropriate regulations, legal frameworks, and ethical guidelines [15]. Fundamentally, current AI technology, including SLMs, remains significantly distant from achieving human-level intelligence, particularly in common sense, real-world understanding, and flexible planning [26].  

The potential impact of advanced SLMs across various industries and society is immense, from enabling more natural human-computer interaction and enhancing accessibility to transforming communication, education, and entertainment [13,15,23]. Looking forward, sustained research is imperative to tackle the remaining technical challenges, such as improving real-time performance, enhancing robustness, reducing data dependency, and developing more sophisticated multimodal and bio-inspired architectures. Simultaneously, addressing the ethical dimensions, including bias mitigation and responsible deployment, will be critical for harnessing the full potential of SLMs for positive societal impact and progressing towards more capable, ethical, and human-like AI communication systems.
