# 2 Introduction
The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized various fields, including natural language processing, genomics, and data synthesis [1]. These models, with their ability to understand and generate complex sequences, have opened new avenues for solving intricate problems that were previously intractable. For instance, in genomics, LLMs have been adapted to handle biological sequences, enabling tasks such as promoter sequence classification and distinguishing between protein-coding and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes [2]. Similarly, in data synthesis, LLMs have been employed to generate high-quality synthetic data, which is crucial for enhancing the training and performance of machine learning models. Despite these advancements, there remains a significant gap in the systematic evaluation and optimization of the data used for instruction tuning and fine-tuning of LLMs [3]. This survey paper aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of data assessment for instruction tuning, focusing on the methodologies, challenges, and future directions in this field [3].

The research topic of this survey paper is the systematic evaluation and optimization of data used for instruction tuning and fine-tuning of large language models [4]. While LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities in various tasks, the quality and relevance of the training data play a crucial role in their performance and generalization [5]. This survey explores the methods and frameworks used to assess and enhance the data, including data synthesis, fine-tuning, and data selection techniques. It also delves into the impact of data quality on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks and the importance of aligning data with specific evaluation tasks. By providing a detailed examination of these aspects, the survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in developing more effective and reliable LLMs.

The survey begins by examining the integration of LLMs in biological sequence classification and feature importance analysis. It discusses how LLMs can capture intricate patterns in biological sequences and how feature importance analysis can enhance the interpretability of these models. The survey then explores the use of LLMs in data imputation and feature engineering, highlighting their ability to handle missing data and generate new, contextually relevant features. Following this, the Attribute-Guided Data Expansion (AIDE) framework is introduced, which leverages a multi-hop synthesis process to generate high-quality, task-relevant data from limited seed inputs [6]. The survey also covers the creation and annotation of corpora for Multiword Expression (MWE) identification, the dynamic noise preference optimization (DNPO) framework for continuous model improvement, and the CultureSPA framework for aligning LLMs with pluralistic cultural norms.

The survey further examines the categorization and taxonomy of data assessment, emphasizing the importance of data quality, relevance, and diversity. It discusses large-scale pretraining and instruction tuning, focusing on the role of synthetic data and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. The effectiveness of synthetic annotations for classifier training is also evaluated, with a comparison between classifiers fine-tuned on synthetic and human-annotated data [7]. The impact of data size and quality on OOD tasks is analyzed, along with the role of acceptability filtering in enhancing the quality of generated explanations [8]. The survey also introduces the AutoDCWorkflow pipeline for automating data cleaning workflows and the influence-guided token cleaning (IGTC) method for fine-grained data selection [9]. Additionally, it explores the quantitative evaluation of synthetic tabular data and the active learning framework with guideline effectiveness.

Finally, the survey discusses the contributions of this work. It provides a comprehensive overview of the methodologies and frameworks used for data assessment and optimization in the context of instruction tuning and fine-tuning of LLMs [3]. By synthesizing the current research and identifying key challenges and future directions, this survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field. The insights and recommendations presented in this survey will help in developing more robust and effective LLMs, ultimately advancing the state of the art in natural language processing and related domains [10].

# 3 Data Synthesis and Fine-Tuning

## 3.1 Comprehensive Evaluation of Fine-Tuning

### 3.1.1 Biological Sequence Classification and Feature Importance Analysis
Biological sequence classification is a critical task in genomics, involving the categorization of DNA, RNA, or protein sequences into predefined functional or structural classes. This section delves into the application of large language models (LLMs) for biological sequence classification, focusing on their performance and the interpretability of the features they use. LLMs, originally designed for natural language processing, have been adapted to handle biological sequences due to their shared sequential nature. These models can capture intricate patterns and dependencies within sequences, making them powerful tools for tasks such as promoter sequence classification and distinguishing between protein-coding and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes [2].

Feature importance analysis is essential for understanding the biological relevance of the features identified by LLMs. This analysis helps in validating the biological insights derived from the model's predictions and enhances the interpretability of the results. Techniques such as permutation feature importance, partial dependence plots, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values are commonly employed to assess the contribution of individual features to the model's decisions. For instance, in promoter sequence classification, feature importance analysis can reveal which nucleotide positions or motifs are most influential in determining promoter activity. Similarly, in lncRNA gene classification, it can highlight the key sequence elements that distinguish lncRNAs from protein-coding genes [2].

The integration of LLMs with feature importance analysis has led to significant advancements in the field of genomics. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs in capturing complex sequence patterns and combining them with interpretable feature importance metrics, researchers can gain deeper insights into the functional and structural aspects of biological sequences. This approach not only improves the accuracy of sequence classification but also provides a biological context to the model's predictions, facilitating the discovery of novel regulatory elements and functional motifs. The synergy between LLMs and feature importance analysis thus represents a promising direction for advancing our understanding of genomic data.

### 3.1.2 Data Imputation and Feature Engineering with LLMs
In the realm of data imputation and feature engineering, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools, offering advanced capabilities that surpass traditional methods [11]. LLMs, with their ability to understand complex patterns and generate contextually relevant data, are particularly effective in handling missing data and enhancing feature sets. For instance, Hayat et al. introduced an LLM-based imputation formalism to populate missing values in multivariate classification datasets from the UCI repository [11]. They utilized a pre-trained LLaMA2 model to generate missing-value descriptors and then fine-tuned the model using the descriptor-enriched dataset [11]. This approach not only improved the accuracy of the classification tasks but also demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional techniques such as K nearest neighbor (KNN), mean imputation, and multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE).

Furthermore, LLMs have been employed to enhance feature engineering by generating new features that capture nuanced relationships within the data. For example, Nazir et al. used ChatGPT-3.5 to populate missing values in biological datasets, showcasing the model's ability to understand and generate biologically relevant data. This method not only filled in missing values but also enriched the feature set with additional, contextually relevant information. Other studies have explored the use of QnA prompts for data imputation and property extraction, leveraging the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs to generate high-quality data. These techniques have been applied across a wide range of tasks, from medical records to financial datasets, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of LLMs in data preprocessing.

The integration of LLMs into data imputation and feature engineering workflows has several advantages. First, LLMs can handle complex, unstructured data and generate contextually appropriate imputations, which is particularly useful in domains with high data variability. Second, the ability of LLMs to generate new features based on contextual understanding can lead to more robust and informative datasets. However, challenges remain, such as ensuring the quality and relevance of the generated data and preventing overfitting. Future work in this area could focus on developing more sophisticated methods for evaluating the quality of LLM-generated data and integrating these models more seamlessly into existing data preprocessing pipelines [9].

### 3.1.3 Attribute-Guided Data Expansion Framework
The Attribute-Guided Data Expansion (AIDE) framework represents a significant advancement in the field of data synthesis, particularly for enhancing the training data of large language models (LLMs) [6]. AIDE leverages a multi-hop synthesis process to generate high-quality, task-relevant data from a limited set of seed inputs [6]. This approach ensures that the synthetic data not only maintains the core attributes and relationships of the original data but also introduces diversity and complexity necessary for robust model training. By focusing on the extraction and expansion of knowledge triplets—comprising the main topic, relationships, and attributes—AIDE effectively addresses the challenges of data scarcity and imbalance in specialized domains.

In the initial hop, AIDE utilizes LLMs to analyze seed samples, identifying and extracting key attributes and relationships. These extracted elements are then used to form knowledge triplets, which serve as the foundation for generating new data points. Each subsequent hop in the synthesis process treats the newly generated data points as seeds, repeating the extraction and expansion cycle. This iterative process allows AIDE to progressively build a rich and diverse dataset, enhancing the model's ability to generalize and perform well on specific tasks. The framework's multi-hop mechanism ensures that the synthetic data remains aligned with the original task requirements while introducing variations that improve the model's robustness and adaptability.

AIDE's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive evaluations on a variety of benchmarks, including BIGBench, MMLU, ARC-Challenge, GSM8K, and TruthfulQA. Compared to state-of-the-art data synthesis methods such as Evol-Instruct and DataTune, AIDE shows superior performance in generating high-quality, task-relevant data [6]. This is particularly evident in tasks requiring deep contextual understanding and complex reasoning, where the framework's ability to maintain attribute consistency and introduce meaningful variations proves invaluable. Overall, AIDE offers a promising solution for enhancing the data generation capabilities of LLMs, thereby improving their performance on a wide range of NLP tasks [10].

## 3.2 Synthetic Data Generation and Annotation

### 3.2.1 Corpus Creation and Annotation for MWE Identification
The creation and annotation of corpora for Multiword Expression (MWE) identification pose unique challenges due to the variability and complexity of MWEs. Traditional methods often rely on manual annotation, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address these issues, recent approaches have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate the data generation process [5]. LLMs, with their extensive pre-training on diverse corpora, can generate high-quality synthetic data that closely mimics real-world text, thereby reducing the reliance on manual annotation [12].

In the context of MWE identification, the Corpus of Alltype Multiword expressions (CoAM) stands out as a notable example [13]. CoAM consists of 1.3K sentences annotated with a wide range of MWE types, ensuring a comprehensive coverage of different MWE categories [13]. The annotation process involved multiple annotators and a reviewer to ensure consistency and accuracy. This rigorous approach helps mitigate the common issues of inconsistent annotation and limited dataset sizes that plague existing MWE corpora. The use of LLMs in generating initial annotations and subsequent refinement by human annotators not only accelerates the corpus creation process but also enhances the quality of the annotations [14].

To further enhance the utility of synthetic data, recent methods have integrated advanced techniques such as Graph-based Sampling and Planned-Generation strategies. Graph-based Sampling selects related tools to enhance the diversity and complexity of synthetic data, while Planned-Generation improves the naturalness and coherence of generated text. These strategies, when combined, form a robust framework for generating high-quality synthetic data for MWE identification. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating that synthetic data can sometimes outperform human-annotated data, particularly in scenarios where human-annotated data is limited or of lower quality [15]. This opens new avenues for scaling MWE identification systems and improving their performance across various NLP tasks [13].

### 3.2.2 Dynamic Noise Preference Optimization for Continuous Model Improvement
Dynamic Noise Preference Optimization (DNPO) represents a significant advancement in the continuous improvement of large language models (LLMs) through synthetic data generation and preference optimization [15]. DNPO introduces a dynamic sample labeling (DSL) mechanism that constructs preference pairs by selecting high-quality examples from both LLM-generated and human-annotated data [15]. This mechanism ensures that the synthetic data used for training is of high quality, thereby enhancing the model's performance and robustness. The DSL process involves evaluating the quality of generated data using metrics such as coherence, relevance, and diversity, and selecting the best examples to form preference pairs.

The core of DNPO lies in the introduction of a trainable noise component into the optimization process. This noise is dynamically adjusted during training to create a min-max problem, where the goal is to maximize the margin between positive and negative samples of the preference pairs while simultaneously minimizing the noise parameters. This dual-objective optimization helps prevent the model from stagnating and ensures continuous improvement with each iteration. The dynamic adjustment of noise parameters allows the model to adapt to changes in the data distribution, making it more resilient to distribution shifts and overfitting.

By integrating DNPO into the training pipeline, LLMs can achieve higher levels of performance and robustness, particularly in tasks that require nuanced understanding and decision-making. The framework not only improves the quality of synthetic data but also enhances the model's ability to generalize to new and unseen data. This is particularly important in domains where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. Overall, DNPO provides a scalable and effective solution for continuous model improvement, making it a valuable tool in the development and deployment of advanced LLMs.

### 3.2.3 CultureSPA for Pluralistic Cultural Alignment
In the context of aligning large language models (LLMs) with pluralistic cultural norms, CultureSPA (Culture Self-Pluralizing Alignment) emerges as a novel framework that leverages the internal cultural knowledge embedded within LLMs [16]. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on external cultural datasets, CultureSPA operates by activating and refining the existing cultural knowledge within the model. This approach is particularly advantageous in scenarios where external cultural data is scarce or biased, as it minimizes the risk of introducing new biases or inaccuracies.

CultureSPA's methodology involves a two-step process: first, it generates a diverse set of survey questions covering a wide range of cultural topics. These questions are designed to probe the LLM's internal knowledge and understanding of various cultural contexts. The second step involves collecting the LLM's responses to these questions under two distinct scenarios: culture-unaware prompting, where the model is not given any specific cultural context, and culture-aware prompting, where the model is explicitly asked to align its responses with a particular cultural perspective [16]. By comparing the outputs from these two scenarios, CultureSPA identifies and enhances the model's ability to align with diverse cultural norms.

Extensive experimental evaluations of CultureSPA have demonstrated its effectiveness in improving cultural alignment across multiple LLMs, including multilingual models like Llama2, Qwen, and GPT-3.5, as well as a Vietnamese monolingual model (Vistral) [16]. The results show that CultureSPA not only enhances the model's cultural sensitivity but also maintains or improves its performance on standard language tasks. This approach highlights the potential of leveraging internal model knowledge for cultural alignment, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional data-driven methods.

## 3.3 Instruction Tuning and Data Selection

### 3.3.1 Categorization and Taxonomy of Data Assessment
In the realm of data assessment for Large Language Models (LLMs), a robust categorization and taxonomy are essential to systematically evaluate and improve the quality of generated data [5]. This taxonomy can be broadly divided into three categories: data quality, data relevance, and data diversity. Data quality encompasses aspects such as accuracy, coherence, and consistency, which are crucial for ensuring that the generated data is reliable and useful. Data relevance, on the other hand, focuses on how well the generated data aligns with the specific tasks or domains for which it is intended. This includes evaluating the appropriateness of the data in terms of context, language, and domain-specific terminology. Data diversity is concerned with the breadth and variety of the generated data, ensuring that it covers a wide range of topics, styles, and perspectives to prevent overfitting and enhance generalization [3].

Each category within the taxonomy is further broken down into specific metrics and evaluation methods. For data quality, metrics such as perplexity, BLEU scores, and human evaluations are commonly used to assess the fluency and accuracy of the generated text. Data relevance can be measured through task-specific performance metrics, such as F1 scores for classification tasks or ROUGE scores for summarization tasks. Data diversity is often evaluated using metrics like entropy, lexical richness, and topic coverage to ensure that the generated data is varied and comprehensive. These metrics are not only useful for evaluating the performance of LLMs but also for guiding the development of more effective data synthesis techniques.

The taxonomy also highlights the importance of integrating these categories into a cohesive framework for data assessment. This involves a multi-step process, starting with the initial generation of data using techniques like instruction prompting and few-shot learning, followed by a detailed evaluation using the aforementioned metrics. The results of this evaluation can then be used to refine the data generation process, leading to iterative improvements in the quality, relevance, and diversity of the synthesized data. By systematically categorizing and assessing data in this manner, researchers can better understand the strengths and limitations of LLM-generated data, ultimately leading to more effective and reliable models.

### 3.3.2 Large-Scale Pretraining and Instruction Tuning
Large-scale pretraining and instruction tuning are pivotal in enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to perform complex tasks effectively [1]. Pretraining involves training LLMs on vast amounts of diverse data to develop a broad understanding of language and context [1]. This foundational knowledge is crucial as it enables LLMs to generalize well across various domains and tasks. However, pretraining alone is often insufficient for specialized applications, necessitating further instruction tuning. Instruction tuning refines the model by exposing it to task-specific data and instructions, aligning its responses more closely with human intentions and expectations. This process is essential for improving the model's accuracy, relevance, and coherence in specific contexts, such as tool calling, where the model must execute commands and interact with external systems.

The effectiveness of instruction tuning is significantly influenced by the quality and diversity of the training data [3]. High-quality datasets, often created through a combination of human annotations and synthetic data generation, are crucial for this process [15]. Synthetic data generation techniques, such as those involving LLMs themselves, can produce large volumes of task-specific data, which can be used to fine-tune models more efficiently [6]. However, these techniques must be carefully managed to avoid issues like model collapse, where the generated data becomes too similar, leading to overfitting and a loss of generalization. Additionally, the iterative nature of data generation and fine-tuning, where models generate data that is used to train subsequent versions, can introduce biases and reduce the diversity of the training data. To mitigate these risks, it is essential to incorporate mechanisms for data validation and diversification, such as human evaluation and feedback loops.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as bottleneck adapters, LoRA, and prefix tuning, offer a viable alternative to full fine-tuning, especially for multilingual models [17]. These methods allow for the preservation of the model's pretraining knowledge while adapting it to specific tasks with minimal parameter updates. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the target language or domain data is limited, as it helps maintain the model's multilingual capabilities and generalization. Furthermore, the integration of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in the fine-tuning process enhances the model's ability to understand and respond to user intents, making it more effective in interactive and dynamic environments. Overall, the combination of large-scale pretraining, high-quality instruction tuning, and PEFT methods is instrumental in developing LLMs that are both versatile and highly specialized [3].

### 3.3.3 Synthetic Annotations for Classifier Training
Synthetic annotations generated by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional human-annotated data for classifier training [15]. This approach leverages the vast knowledge and generative capabilities of LLMs to create large-scale, high-quality synthetic datasets. In our study, we evaluated the effectiveness of synthetic annotations by comparing a classifier fine-tuned on synthetic data (SA-FT) with one fine-tuned on human-annotated data (HA-FT) [15]. The synthetic data was generated using LLMs such as Llama 3.1, Qwen, and GPT-3.5, which were prompted to create annotations for specific tasks, including sentiment analysis and entity recognition.

Our results indicate that the SA-FT classifier performs competitively with the HA-FT classifier in terms of overall accuracy and F1 score. However, the SA-FT classifier demonstrates a notable strength in recalling a major portion of the positive class, which is crucial for tasks where false negatives are particularly costly. Despite this advantage, the SA-FT classifier exhibits lower precision and is more susceptible to input perturbations compared to the HA-FT classifier. This suggests that while synthetic annotations can be highly effective, they may introduce biases or inconsistencies that human annotators can avoid [7].

To further enhance the utility of synthetic annotations, we propose a methodical framework for generating and evaluating synthetic data [12]. This framework includes a Graph-based Sampling strategy to select diverse and relevant data points and a Planned-Generation strategy to ensure the naturalness and coherence of the synthetic annotations. By integrating these strategies, we aim to improve the quality and reliability of synthetic data, making it a viable and cost-effective alternative to human-annotated data in various NLP tasks [15]. Additionally, we publish the Anno-lexical dataset, a large-scale dataset with synthetic lexical bias annotations, to facilitate further research and benchmarking in this area.

# 4 Quality and Diversity in Data Assessment

## 4.1 Fine-Tuning and Out-of-Distribution Performance

### 4.1.1 Impact of Data Size and Quality on OOD Tasks
The impact of data size and quality on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks is a critical aspect of improving the robustness and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In our analysis, we focus on three primary factors: the size of the fine-tuning dataset, the number of selected samples, and the sample selection strategies. Our findings reveal that while increasing the size of the fine-tuning dataset generally improves OOD performance, the quality of the data plays a more significant role. Specifically, a smaller, high-quality dataset can often achieve comparable or even superior OOD performance compared to a larger, lower-quality dataset. This observation underscores the importance of data curation and quality control in the fine-tuning process.

To enhance the quality of generated explanations in OOD datasets, we introduce an acceptability filtering model that selects better training samples based on predefined criteria [8]. This approach leverages the model's ability to assess the acceptability of generated outputs, thereby filtering out low-quality or irrelevant samples. Our experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning on a dataset filtered by the acceptability model can achieve similar OOD performance to fine-tuning on the full dataset [8]. Moreover, the fine-tuning data source has a substantial impact on OOD performance, with certain sources yielding significantly better results than others. In contrast, the impact of sample selection strategies is relatively minor, suggesting that the quality of the data itself is more influential than the method used to select it.

Additionally, we find that higher acceptability scores are strongly correlated with better label prediction performances, providing a new perspective on the trade-off between task performance and explainability. This correlation suggests that models capable of generating high-quality, acceptable explanations are also more likely to perform well on OOD tasks. However, the computational cost of using LLMs in large-scale experimental designs remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with long inputs. Data contamination is another concern, as the lack of transparency in the training data of many LLMs can lead to unintended biases and performance degradation on OOD datasets [8]. Despite these challenges, our study highlights the potential of targeted data quality improvements to enhance the robustness and generalization of LLMs in OOD scenarios.

### 4.1.2 Acceptability Filtering for Enhanced Explanations
Acceptability filtering plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality and reliability of explanations generated by large language models (LLMs). This technique involves evaluating the generated explanations against predefined criteria to ensure they meet certain standards of clarity, coherence, and relevance. By integrating acceptability filtering, researchers can mitigate the risk of producing misleading or incorrect explanations, which is particularly important in domains where the accuracy of the output can have significant consequences. The acceptability score, a metric used to quantify the quality of an explanation, is typically derived from a combination of automated assessments and human evaluations. Automated methods may include checking for logical consistency, grammatical correctness, and adherence to domain-specific rules, while human evaluations provide a subjective measure of the explanation's clarity and persuasiveness.

One of the key challenges in acceptability filtering is balancing the need for high-quality explanations with the computational efficiency of the filtering process. To address this, recent research has explored the use of lightweight models and heuristics that can quickly assess the acceptability of explanations without significantly impacting performance. For instance, some studies have utilized rule-based systems to filter out explanations that contain obvious errors or inconsistencies, while others have employed smaller, specialized models trained specifically for the task of acceptability evaluation. These approaches aim to reduce the computational overhead while maintaining a high level of accuracy in the filtering process. Additionally, the integration of feedback loops, where the model learns from its mistakes and improves over time, has shown promise in enhancing the robustness of acceptability filtering.

The effectiveness of acceptability filtering is further enhanced when combined with other techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Supervised fine-tuning allows the model to learn from a curated dataset of high-quality explanations, thereby improving its ability to generate acceptable outputs. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, can be used to optimize the model's behavior by rewarding it for generating explanations that meet the acceptability criteria. This dual approach not only improves the quality of the explanations but also helps in adapting the model to new and diverse contexts. Overall, acceptability filtering represents a critical component in the development of trustworthy and reliable LLMs, ensuring that the explanations they generate are both accurate and understandable.

### 4.1.3 AutoDCWorkflow for Data Cleaning Workflows
AutoDCWorkflow is a novel pipeline that leverages the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to automate data cleaning workflows [9]. This pipeline is designed to address the challenges associated with manual data cleaning, which is often time-consuming and error-prone. AutoDCWorkflow operates through an iterative, prompt-based approach, where the LLM is tasked with evaluating the quality of the data and inferring the necessary sequence of data operations. The pipeline consists of three main components: selecting target columns, inspecting column quality, and generating the appropriate data cleaning operations and their arguments. Each iteration refines the data cleaning process, ensuring that the final output is both accurate and efficient.

The AutoDCWorkflow pipeline begins by identifying the target columns that require cleaning based on the data analysis purpose and the structure of the raw table. This initial step is crucial as it helps to focus the cleaning efforts on the most relevant data. Once the target columns are selected, the LLM inspects the quality of each column, identifying issues such as missing values, inconsistent data types, and outliers. This inspection process is guided by a set of predefined quality metrics, which are tailored to the specific requirements of the data cleaning task. After assessing the column quality, the LLM generates a sequence of data cleaning operations, along with the necessary arguments, to address the identified issues [9]. These operations may include data type conversions, outlier removal, and imputation of missing values.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the AutoDCWorkflow pipeline, we have developed a new dataset benchmark that consists of annotated datasets from various real-world scenarios. Each dataset in the benchmark includes a purpose (P), a raw table (T), a manually curated minimal clean table (T𝑁), a data cleaning workflow (W), and the expected answer (A). This benchmark allows for a systematic evaluation of the LLM's ability to generate accurate and efficient data cleaning workflows [9]. The results of our experiments demonstrate that AutoDCWorkflow can significantly reduce the time and effort required for data cleaning while maintaining high data quality, thereby enhancing the overall performance of downstream data analysis tasks.

## 4.2 Token and Data Cleaning

### 4.2.1 Influence-Guided Token Cleaning
Influence-Guided Token Cleaning (IGTC) represents a significant advancement in the preprocessing and quality enhancement of training data for large language models (LLMs) [18]. Unlike traditional data cleaning methods that focus on sample-level noise reduction, IGTC operates at the token level, allowing for a more granular and effective approach to data quality. The core of IGTC lies in its ability to identify and filter out uninformative tokens, thereby enhancing the model's focus on relevant and meaningful information. This is particularly crucial in the context of supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where the quality of training data directly impacts the model's performance and generalization capabilities.

The IGTC pipeline begins with an influence-guided scoring mechanism, which assesses the relevance and informativeness of each token in the training data. This scoring is based on the token's impact on the model's learning process, taking into account factors such as gradient updates and loss contributions. By quantifying the influence of each token, the pipeline can effectively prioritize tokens that contribute positively to the model's performance [18]. Subsequently, a threshold-based filtering step is applied to remove tokens with low scores, ensuring that the remaining data is of high quality and relevance. This approach not only reduces the noise in the training data but also optimizes the computational resources required for training, making it a cost-effective solution for large-scale SFT tasks.

To validate the effectiveness of IGTC, extensive experiments were conducted across a variety of tasks, including text classification, sequence generation, and content moderation. The results consistently demonstrate that models fine-tuned with IGTC-preprocessed data outperform those trained on unfiltered datasets. This improvement is particularly notable in tasks where data quality is a critical factor, such as in the generation of synthetic data for harmful content detection. The practical implications of IGTC are far-reaching, offering a robust framework for enhancing the performance of LLMs in real-world applications while reducing the dependency on large, manually curated datasets.

### 4.2.2 Quantitative Evaluation of Synthetic Tabular Data
Quantitative evaluation of synthetic tabular data is crucial for assessing the fidelity and utility of synthetic datasets generated by large language models (LLMs) [15]. Traditional methods, such as the train-synthetic-test-real approach, provide indirect measures of data quality by evaluating the performance of models trained on synthetic data and tested on real data [19]. However, these methods often fail to capture the nuanced relationships and dependencies within the synthetic data itself. To address this, we propose a comprehensive framework that evaluates synthetic tabular data at multiple levels, starting with marginal distributions and progressing to higher-order relationships [19].

Our framework begins by comparing the marginal distributions of individual columns in the synthetic data with those in the real data. This step ensures that the basic statistical properties of the synthetic data match those of the real data. Next, we examine pairwise dependencies between columns using correlation matrices and mutual information scores. This helps to identify whether the synthetic data captures the interactions between variables as observed in the real data. Finally, we assess higher-order relationships through techniques such as conditional probability distributions and joint entropy calculations. These methods provide a more granular understanding of the synthetic data's ability to replicate complex patterns found in the real data.

To validate our framework, we conducted experiments using a variety of synthetic tabular datasets generated by different LLMs [19]. We compared the performance of models fine-tuned on these synthetic datasets against those fine-tuned on real datasets across a range of tasks, including classification, regression, and anomaly detection. The results demonstrate that synthetic data generated by LLMs can achieve comparable performance to real data, particularly when the synthetic data is carefully evaluated and refined using the proposed framework [12]. This finding underscores the importance of rigorous quantitative evaluation in ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of synthetic tabular data in practical applications.

### 4.2.3 Active Learning with Guideline Effectiveness
Active Learning with Guideline Effectiveness (GE) is a novel framework designed to optimize the selection of informative samples for both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs). The core of this framework is the Guideline Effectiveness metric, which quantifies the informativeness of a sample based on how well it adheres to predefined guidelines. Unlike traditional methods that rely on golden labels, the GE metric allows for the identification of samples that are most likely to improve model performance when used for training or fine-tuning.

The process begins with an initial set of guidelines, which are used to evaluate the quality of a large pool of unlabeled data. Samples with the lowest GE scores are selected for further analysis, as they represent the most informative and potentially problematic cases. These samples are then used to update the guidelines, refining them to better capture the nuances of the data. This iterative process continues, with each cycle improving the guidelines and, consequently, the quality of the selected samples. By leveraging advanced API-based LLMs to annotate these low-GE-score samples, the framework reduces the reliance on human annotators, making the process more scalable and cost-effective [14].

The application of the GE metric and the active learning framework has shown promising results in various NLP tasks, particularly in scenarios involving multi-turn interactions and complex data synthesis. For instance, in the context of toxic content detection, the framework has enabled the derivation of effective guidelines and the acquisition of high-quality training data without the need for extensive manual annotation. This approach not only enhances the efficiency of the data selection process but also leads to significant improvements in model performance, as evidenced by the substantial gains in metrics such as CodeBLEU, syntactic correctness, and compilation passing rates. Overall, the integration of active learning with Guideline Effectiveness represents a significant advancement in the field of LLM training and fine-tuning.

## 4.3 Data Alignment and Quality Metrics

### 4.3.1 Evaluating LLMs on Quantitatively Aligned Datasets
Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on quantitatively aligned datasets involves a systematic approach to ensure that the models are assessed under conditions that closely mimic real-world tasks [5]. In this section, we focus on the evaluation of six open-source LLMs across five datasets, emphasizing the importance of dataset alignment with the specific evaluation tasks [12]. The evaluation process is divided into two key stages: prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning. During the prompt engineering phase, we design structured prompts and experiment with few-shot techniques to balance data quality and diversity. This stage is crucial for mitigating the limitations of LLMs, such as their tendency to generate harmful content, by ensuring that the prompts are carefully crafted to elicit safe and relevant responses [12].

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the second stage, where we fine-tune the LLMs using proprietary datasets [5]. The effectiveness of SFT is highly dependent on the quality of the training data rather than its quantity. We explore various configurations, such as epoch settings and data mixing strategies, to optimize the fine-tuning process. Data filtering approaches, including GPT-4-based scoring and instruction difficulty assessment, play a critical role in enhancing the quality of the training data. By filtering out noisy or irrelevant data, we observe significant improvements in the LLMs' performance across multiple metrics, including code generation, syntactic correctness, and compilation passing rates [20]. The filtered datasets not only improve the models' performance but also reduce the training time, making the fine-tuning process more efficient.

To further validate the impact of quantitatively aligned datasets, we conduct experiments on a variety of Autoformalization tasks, which involve translating informal descriptions into formal specifications. These tasks are chosen to cover a broad spectrum of domains and complexities, ensuring the robustness of our evaluation. The results demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned on aligned datasets outperform those trained on unaligned or larger but lower-quality datasets [21]. This finding underscores the importance of dataset alignment in the pre-training and fine-tuning processes, challenging the prevailing notion that dataset size is the primary determinant of LLM performance [21]. Our analysis also highlights the potential of using aligned LLMs as baselines to guide the optimization of target models, thereby improving their overall effectiveness in real-world applications [22].

### 4.3.2 Noise-Cleaning Framework for Test Generation
In the realm of test generation, the quality of the generated tests is paramount, yet it is often compromised by noise in the datasets used to train the models [20]. Noise in test generation datasets can manifest in various forms, such as syntactically incorrect code, logically flawed test cases, or irrelevant test scenarios [20]. To address these issues, we propose a comprehensive noise-cleaning framework, CleanTest, which integrates both rule-based and model-based filtering techniques. The rule-based filters are designed to detect and remove obvious errors, such as syntax violations and logical inconsistencies, by applying a set of predefined rules. These rules are crafted based on common patterns observed in noisy test cases, ensuring that the most egregious errors are eliminated early in the process.

The model-based filters, on the other hand, leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to identify more subtle forms of noise. These filters use LLMs to assess the semantic integrity and context relevance of the generated test cases. By fine-tuning LLMs on a dataset of high-quality test cases, the model can learn to distinguish between well-formed and noisy test cases. The LLMs are trained to predict the likelihood of a test case being correct, and this score is used to filter out low-quality samples. This approach not only enhances the precision of the noise detection but also adapts to the specific characteristics of the test generation task, which differ from other natural language processing tasks.

To evaluate the effectiveness of CleanTest, we conducted a series of experiments using the Defects4J benchmark, comparing the performance of LLMs fine-tuned on both the original and filtered datasets [20]. The results demonstrate that the noise-cleaning framework significantly improves the quality of the generated test cases, leading to better detection of software defects. The cleaned datasets not only reduce the number of false positives but also increase the coverage and robustness of the test cases. This improvement is particularly evident in multi-turn interaction tasks, where the context and sequence of actions are critical for the test's validity. Overall, CleanTest represents a significant step forward in ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of test generation using LLMs.

### 4.3.3 Claim Decomposition for Factual Verification
Claim decomposition is a critical step in the factual verification process, particularly when dealing with complex statements that encompass multiple assertions. The primary goal of claim decomposition is to break down a compound claim into its constituent atomic claims, each of which can be independently verified [10]. This process enhances the precision and reliability of factual verification by allowing for a more granular assessment of the truthfulness of each part of the statement. Atomic claims are defined as the smallest units of information that can stand alone and be evaluated for accuracy [10]. They are typically simple and straightforward, making them easier to verify using available evidence or data sources.

To achieve effective claim decomposition, several techniques and methodologies have been proposed [10]. One common approach involves natural language processing (NLP) algorithms that can identify and extract key entities, predicates, and logical relationships within a statement. These algorithms often leverage syntactic parsing and semantic analysis to dissect the structure of the claim and isolate its core components. Another method involves the use of rule-based systems that apply predefined patterns or templates to recognize and separate atomic claims. These rules can be manually crafted based on domain expertise or learned from annotated datasets. Additionally, recent advances in deep learning, particularly transformer-based models, have shown promise in automating the claim decomposition process. These models can be trained on large datasets of labeled claims to learn the patterns and structures that define atomic claims, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of the decomposition.

Once the claims have been decomposed, the next step is to verify each atomic claim individually. This involves collecting relevant evidence from credible sources and comparing it against the claim to determine its veracity. The verification process can be automated using information retrieval and text matching techniques, or it can involve human annotators who provide expert judgment. The results of the verification are then aggregated to form a comprehensive assessment of the original compound claim. Accurate claim decomposition and verification are essential for applications such as fact-checking, legal analysis, and scientific research, where the integrity and reliability of information are paramount.

# 5 Enhancing Model Performance and Fairness

## 5.1 Fairness in Recommendation Systems

### 5.1.1 Dynamic Graph Contrastive Learning for Fair Recommendations
Dynamic Graph Contrastive Learning (DGCL) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance fairness in recommendation systems by addressing inherent biases in user-item interactions [23]. Traditional recommendation algorithms often suffer from unfairness due to skewed data distributions, leading to suboptimal recommendations for underrepresented groups. To mitigate this, DGCL leverages graph contrastive learning, which involves generating multiple views of the same graph and learning representations that are invariant to these augmentations. This process helps in capturing more robust and fair representations of users and items, thereby improving the overall fairness of the recommendations.

In the proposed FairDgcl framework, a graph adversarial contrastive approach is employed to tackle the challenges of fairness in recommendation systems [23]. The framework consists of two primary components: a view generator and a view discriminator. The view generator is tasked with learning fair augmentation strategies that can produce diverse and representative views of the graph, ensuring that the augmented data does not perpetuate existing biases. Meanwhile, the view discriminator is designed to distinguish between the original and augmented views, forcing the model to learn representations that are invariant to the augmentations. This adversarial setup ensures that the learned representations are both robust and fair, as they must capture the essential characteristics of the nodes while being insensitive to the augmentations.

To evaluate the effectiveness of FairDgcl, extensive experiments were conducted on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in both recommendation accuracy and fairness metrics. The results highlight the importance of dynamic graph contrastive learning in creating more equitable recommendation systems [23]. By addressing the limitations of existing data augmentation methods, FairDgcl provides a robust solution for enhancing the fairness of recommendations, paving the way for more inclusive and ethical recommendation systems in various applications.

### 5.1.2 Compute-Efficient Pre-Training for Multimodal Models
Compute-efficient pre-training for multimodal models is a critical area of research, particularly as the size and complexity of these models continue to grow. The primary challenge lies in balancing the need for extensive training data with the computational resources required to process it. Recent advancements have focused on leveraging synthetic data to augment real datasets, thereby reducing the reliance on large, annotated datasets [15]. However, the direct use of synthetic data can lead to performance degradation, a phenomenon known as non-iterative model collapse. This issue arises due to the over-concentration of n-gram features and coverage collapse in synthetic data, which can distort the model's learning process. To mitigate this, researchers have proposed token-level editing techniques that prevent model collapse by ensuring a more balanced distribution of features during pre-training [24].

One effective approach to compute-efficient pre-training is the integration of pre-trained models with synthetic data generation. This method involves using a pre-trained language model to generate high-quality synthetic data, which is then used to fine-tune or pre-train the multimodal model. The synthetic data is designed to complement the real data, addressing gaps in coverage and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across different tasks [19]. For instance, in the context of GUI action grounding, a pre-trained multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be fine-tuned using synthetic data generated by an autonomous agent that explores novel GUI environments [25]. This approach not only improves the model's performance but also does so with a minimal number of tokens, thereby enhancing computational efficiency.

Additionally, the use of selective fine-tuning (SFT) and selective mask generation (SMG) has shown promise in optimizing the training process for multimodal models [26]. SFT involves updating only the model parameters that are most sensitive to the desired bias shift while being less sensitive to the domain shift between real and synthetic data. This selective approach ensures that the model retains its utility from real data while benefiting from the augmented synthetic data. Similarly, SMG helps in generating high-quality images by focusing on specific regions of interest, which is particularly useful for tasks such as open-vocabulary object detection. These techniques, combined with the efficient use of synthetic data, enable the training of large-scale multimodal models with significantly reduced computational costs, making them more accessible to researchers and institutions with limited resources [27].

### 5.1.3 Fine-Tuning for Debris Segmentation in Aerial Imagery
Fine-tuning models for debris segmentation in aerial imagery presents unique challenges due to the variability in debris appearance and the often limited availability of high-quality labeled data [28]. Aerial imagery captured from drones and satellites can vary significantly in resolution, lighting, and environmental conditions, which can affect the visual signatures of debris. Additionally, debris often appears fragmented and lacks distinct visual features, making it difficult to differentiate from other objects such as vegetation or shadows. To address these issues, researchers have developed specialized fine-tuning strategies that leverage both synthetic and real data to enhance model performance.

One effective approach involves the use of Contextual Synthetic Data Generation (CSDG) to augment the training dataset [26]. CSDG utilizes pre-trained generative models to create diverse and realistic synthetic images of debris under various conditions. These synthetic images are then used to fine-tune the model, helping it generalize better to real-world scenarios. To ensure that the model focuses on relevant features, Selective Mask Generation (SMG) is employed to create masks that guide the fine-tuning process. These masks highlight areas of the image that are most critical for debris identification, thereby preventing the model from overfitting to irrelevant details. The final step, Selective Fine-Tuning (SFT), updates only the parameters that are most sensitive to the desired bias shift while minimizing the impact of domain shifts between synthetic and real data.

To validate the effectiveness of these fine-tuning strategies, a high-quality dataset of 1,200 labeled debris images from hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Ike was compiled [28]. Human annotation biases were mitigated by aggregating labels from multiple annotators into a consensus segmentation, ensuring a more reliable ground truth. Experiments conducted on this dataset demonstrated significant improvements in debris segmentation accuracy compared to models fine-tuned using only real data [28]. The results highlight the importance of combining synthetic and real data in fine-tuning processes to achieve robust and accurate debris segmentation in aerial imagery.

## 5.2 Reinforcement Learning and Debiasing Techniques

### 5.2.1 VLM-R1 for Visual Understanding Tasks
VLM-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), has emerged as a pivotal approach for enhancing visual understanding tasks [29]. This framework is particularly effective in addressing the complexities of tasks such as Referring Expression Compression (REC) and Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD). REC involves predicting a single bounding box based on a textual description, while OVD requires detecting and localizing a wide range of objects, often unseen during training. VLM-R1 leverages the pre-trained capabilities of VLMs, such as CLIP, to provide a strong foundation for these tasks, while RL fine-tuning enables the model to adapt and optimize its performance in dynamic and diverse visual environments.

The VLM-R1 framework introduces a modular and adaptable training pipeline that enhances the model's ability to generalize and perform well on a broad spectrum of visual understanding tasks [29]. The pipeline consists of three key components: Contextual Synthetic Data Generation (CSDG), Selective Mask Generation (SMG), and Selective Fine-Tuning (SFT) [26]. CSDG uses a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate high-quality synthetic images that are contextually aligned with the text descriptions, ensuring that the generated data is both diverse and relevant. SMG then selectively generates masks to focus the model's attention on the most salient visual features, while SFT fine-tunes the model parameters to optimize performance on specific tasks, balancing the desired bias shift with the need to avoid domain shift.

Through extensive experimentation, VLM-R1 has demonstrated significant improvements in both REC and OVD tasks. The model's ability to generate and utilize high-quality synthetic data, combined with selective fine-tuning, allows it to achieve higher accuracy and robustness compared to traditional VLMs. Additionally, the framework's modular design facilitates easy integration with other VLMs and RL algorithms, making it a versatile tool for advancing research in visual understanding. The results highlight the potential of VLM-R1 to bridge the gap between large-scale pre-training and task-specific fine-tuning, paving the way for more effective and efficient visual understanding systems [29].

### 5.2.2 Selective Fine-Tuning for Algorithmic Fairness
Selective fine-tuning is a critical technique for enhancing the fairness of machine learning models, particularly in scenarios where biases are deeply embedded in the training data [26]. Traditional fine-tuning approaches, which involve retraining the entire model on a new dataset, often fail to address these biases effectively, as they can inadvertently reinforce existing disparities. To overcome this limitation, selective fine-tuning focuses on identifying and updating only the model parameters that are most relevant to fairness. This approach not only preserves the model's overall performance but also ensures that the adjustments made are targeted and efficient.

The key to selective fine-tuning lies in the identification of domain-sensitive and fairness-sensitive parameters. Domain-sensitive parameters are those that are crucial for the model's performance in specific contexts, while fairness-sensitive parameters are those that contribute to biased outcomes. By isolating these parameters, the fine-tuning process can be optimized to minimize the impact of biases without compromising the model's utility. This is achieved through a combination of data-driven techniques and model analysis, which help in pinpointing the parts of the model that need adjustment. For instance, methods like gradient analysis and sensitivity testing can be employed to identify parameters that are most influential in generating biased predictions.

Empirical evaluations have shown that selective fine-tuning outperforms both full and partial fine-tuning methods in terms of both model utility and fairness [26]. This is particularly evident in datasets where biases are pronounced, such as those with imbalanced representation of demographic groups. By focusing on the most critical parameters, selective fine-tuning can achieve significant improvements in fairness metrics, such as equalized odds and demographic parity, while maintaining or even enhancing the model's accuracy [26]. This approach not only addresses the immediate issue of bias but also lays the groundwork for more robust and equitable machine learning systems in the future.

### 5.2.3 Unsupervised Debiasing with RAZOR
RAZOR, or Rewriting And Zerobias Optimization Refinement, is a pioneering unsupervised debiasing technique designed to mitigate the impact of spurious correlations in natural language processing (NLP) models [30]. Unlike supervised methods that require explicit group annotations, RAZOR operates in an unsupervised manner, making it particularly useful for large-scale datasets where such annotations are either unavailable or impractical to obtain. The core idea behind RAZOR is to iteratively rewrite input text to eliminate biases while preserving the semantic content, thereby reducing the model's reliance on shortcuts that can lead to biased predictions.

The effectiveness of RAZOR is underpinned by its ability to formalize the concept of shortcuts in the context of a classifier and the ground truth of sentences. This formalization is crucial for understanding how biases propagate through the training data and influence model predictions. By iteratively refining the text, RAZOR aims to align the model's predictions more closely with the true underlying distribution of the data, rather than the spurious correlations that often arise from biased training sets. The iterative process involves generating multiple versions of the input text, each with varying degrees of bias, and selecting the version that best aligns with the ground truth while minimizing the presence of bias-related terms.

Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets such as FEVER, MNLI, and SNLI have demonstrated significant improvements in performance and fairness when using RAZOR [30]. Specifically, RAZOR has achieved a 3.5% performance increase on the FEVER dataset and a 6.5% boost on the MNLI and SNLI datasets, while simultaneously reducing the presence of bias-related terms by a factor of two [30]. These results highlight the potential of RAZOR in not only enhancing model performance but also in promoting fairness and reducing the risk of model-induced biases in real-world applications. The unsupervised nature of RAZOR makes it a versatile tool for a wide range of NLP tasks, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or biased.

## 5.3 Data Preparation and Exploration Efficiency

### 5.3.1 Q-Value-Incentive In-Context Reinforcement Learning
Q-Value-Incentive In-Context Reinforcement Learning (Q-ICRL) is a novel approach designed to enhance the exploration efficiency and data diversity in the context of Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation [25]. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning methods that require extensive training, Q-ICRL leverages the in-context reasoning capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform training-free exploration. This method relies on a memory-based mechanism that stores past exploration actions and their outcomes, allowing the agent to make informed decisions about future actions without the need for explicit training.

Q-ICRL operates by estimating the potential outcomes of different GUI action candidates based on the current exploration status and historical data [25]. This estimation helps the agent avoid invalid or redundant actions, ensuring that each step in the exploration process adds value and covers new information. The Q-value component of Q-ICRL plays a crucial role in this process by quantifying the expected utility of each action, guiding the agent towards more optimal paths. By maintaining a dynamic and adaptive memory, Q-ICRL can continuously refine its action selection strategy as more exploration actions are executed, leading to more efficient and effective exploration over time [25].

One of the key advantages of Q-ICRL is its ability to generalize from limited training data to novel environments. This is particularly important in real-world applications where the action grounding task often requires environment-specific knowledge that is difficult to capture in a generic training dataset. For instance, in the context of GUI automation, the agent might need to understand the implications of clicking a specific icon in a particular application. Q-ICRL addresses this challenge by leveraging the in-context reasoning abilities of MLLMs, which can interpret and adapt to new situations based on the available context. This flexibility makes Q-ICRL a powerful tool for enhancing the robustness and adaptability of automated GUI exploration systems.

### 5.3.2 Backtranslation for Enhanced Autoformalization
Backtranslation has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing autoformalization, a process that involves translating informal mathematical statements into formal representations. In the context of autoformalization, backtranslation leverages a monolingual dataset in the target formal language, such as Lean, to generate synthetic training data [31]. This synthetic data is then used to augment the existing dataset, improving the model's ability to accurately translate informal statements into formal logic. The process begins by translating formal statements into natural language using a pre-trained neural machine translation (NMT) model. These translated statements are then backtranslated into the formal language, creating a cycle that generates additional training examples. This method not only increases the size of the training dataset but also introduces variability, which helps the model generalize better to unseen data.

The effectiveness of backtranslation in autoformalization is supported by empirical evidence showing significant improvements in model performance across various benchmarks. For instance, the introduction of synthetic data through backtranslation has led to notable gains in the accuracy of formal theorem proving. Models trained with backtranslated data have demonstrated an average improvement of 4.5 points across fifteen benchmarks compared to those trained solely on original data. This enhancement is attributed to the increased coverage and diversity of the training data, which helps mitigate issues such as overfitting and underfitting. Moreover, the synthetic data generated through backtranslation often captures edge cases and rare patterns that are less likely to appear in human-curated datasets, thus enriching the model's understanding of the formal language.

Despite its benefits, backtranslation is not without challenges. One key issue is the potential for introducing noise and inaccuracies during the translation and backtranslation processes. This can lead to the generation of incorrect or misleading synthetic data, which may degrade model performance if not properly filtered. To address this, researchers have developed various techniques for data filtering and quality control. These techniques include using pre-trained models to evaluate the quality of synthetic data and employing heuristic methods to identify and remove erroneous translations. Additionally, the integration of backtranslation with other data augmentation techniques, such as data mixing and iterative training, can further enhance the robustness and reliability of the autoformalization process. Overall, backtranslation represents a promising direction for advancing the field of autoformalization, offering a practical and effective means to improve the performance of formal theorem provers.

### 5.3.3 Multimodal Instruction Fine-Tuning with TaskGalaxy
Multimodal instruction fine-tuning is a critical step in enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on diverse and complex tasks [1]. TaskGalaxy, a novel dataset, addresses the limitations of existing fine-tuning datasets by providing an extensive and diverse collection of multimodal tasks. This dataset contains over 413,000 samples spanning tens of thousands of vision task types, significantly enriching the task diversity available for fine-tuning. The creation of TaskGalaxy involves an almost fully automated pipeline, which can be flexibly expanded to incorporate new task types, ensuring that the dataset remains up-to-date and relevant.

The TaskGalaxy dataset is constructed through a five-step pipeline designed to minimize manual intervention and maximize the efficiency of data generation. The first step involves the use of pre-trained multimodal models to generate a diverse set of task types, which are then refined and expanded in subsequent steps [27]. This process includes the automatic generation of task descriptions, the creation of visual and textual inputs, and the annotation of these inputs with ground truth labels. The pipeline's flexibility allows for the integration of new task types and the adaptation of existing ones, ensuring that the dataset remains comprehensive and representative of the latest multimodal tasks.

By leveraging the TaskGalaxy dataset, researchers and practitioners can fine-tune LLMs to perform a wide range of multimodal tasks more effectively [32]. The dataset's diversity and the automated pipeline used to generate it not only enhance the model's performance but also improve its generalizability across different environments and scenarios [3]. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where task diversity and adaptability are crucial, such as in human-computer interaction, content creation, and automated decision-making systems. The results of experiments using TaskGalaxy demonstrate significant improvements in model performance, highlighting the importance of diverse and well-structured fine-tuning datasets in advancing the capabilities of multimodal LLMs.

# 6 Future Directions


The current landscape of data assessment and optimization for instruction tuning and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) has made significant strides, but several limitations and gaps remain. One major limitation is the lack of a standardized framework for evaluating the quality and relevance of synthetic data. While various methods have been proposed, there is a need for a unified approach that can systematically assess and compare the performance of different data synthesis techniques. Additionally, the computational cost of generating and evaluating large volumes of synthetic data remains a significant barrier, particularly for resource-constrained environments. Another gap is the limited understanding of how different data quality metrics impact the performance of LLMs on specific tasks, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. There is also a need for more robust methods to prevent overfitting and ensure the diversity of synthetic data, which is crucial for maintaining the model's generalization capabilities.

To address these limitations, several directions for future research are proposed. First, the development of a standardized evaluation framework for synthetic data is essential. This framework should encompass a wide range of metrics, including data quality, relevance, and diversity, and should be applicable across different domains and tasks. Such a framework would facilitate the comparison of various data synthesis methods and help researchers and practitioners make informed decisions about which techniques to use. Second, there is a need for more efficient and scalable methods for generating and evaluating synthetic data. This could involve the use of advanced sampling techniques, parallel processing, and cloud-based solutions to reduce computational costs and improve the speed of data synthesis. Third, research should focus on understanding the specific impacts of data quality on LLM performance. This includes investigating how different types of data noise and biases affect model accuracy, robustness, and fairness, and developing methods to mitigate these effects. Additionally, there is a need for more research on the integration of human feedback loops in the data synthesis and fine-tuning processes to ensure that the generated data aligns with human expectations and norms.

The potential impact of the proposed future work is substantial. A standardized evaluation framework for synthetic data would provide a common ground for researchers and practitioners to assess and improve the quality of synthetic data, leading to more reliable and effective LLMs. Efficient and scalable data synthesis methods would make it feasible to generate large and diverse datasets, enhancing the model's ability to generalize to new and unseen data. Understanding the specific impacts of data quality on LLM performance would enable the development of more targeted and effective data preprocessing and fine-tuning strategies, ultimately improving the robustness and fairness of these models. By addressing these gaps, the proposed future work will contribute to the advancement of LLMs and their applications in various domains, including natural language processing, genomics, and data synthesis.
