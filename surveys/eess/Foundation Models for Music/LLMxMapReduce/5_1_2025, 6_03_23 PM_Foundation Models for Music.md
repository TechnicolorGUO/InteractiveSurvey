# 0. Foundation Models for Music  

# 1. Introduction  

Foundation models represent a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, characterized by their large scale, pre-training on vast datasets, and ability to be adapted for a wide range of downstream tasks. This approach has proven transformative across various domains, and its application to the realm of music is rapidly gaining prominence [5,7].  

In the music domain, foundation models are typically adapted architectures, such as pre-trained language models (PLMs), large language models (LLMs), and latent diffusion models (LDMs), specifically trained on massive musical datasets [5,7,14,16,29].  

![](images/236324604b00c7a6f6b31a849ba270f84cd001cb114fdca3be79f4dcffbc87d8.jpg)  

These models learn complex musical patterns, structures, rhythm, and melody through core technologies like Deep Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Transformer models, and Diffusion Models [11,19,26]. By integrating musical data with modalities like language, these models aim to capture sophisticated musical features and produce outputs that align more closely with human perception [14]. For instance, models like YuE, built upon the LLaMA2 architecture, are specifically designed for complex tasks such as long-form music generation, addressing problems like lyrics-to-song with capabilities to generate music up to five minutes long while maintaining lyrical alignment and musical coherence [12]. Similarly, models like MERT focus on audio-based music understanding, demonstrating the breadth of tasks addressed by these foundation models [16].​  

The advent of foundation models for music, particularly within the broader context of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), holds the potential to revolutionize numerous aspects of the music lifecycle [2,19,26]. They empower systems to achieve end-to-end music generation, from single tracks to multi-track mixing [19], automate and personalize music creation through data-driven approaches [2], and assist human musicians by presenting novel ideas for refinement [20]. This technological shift is transforming music production, making creative tools more accessible to both novices and experienced artists, lowering the barrier to entry for intelligent music creation, and enabling the exploration of new musical styles and possibilities [8,9,26,27]. The market for AI in music is projected for substantial growth, underscoring the increasing significance and adoption of these technologies [8]. Beyond generation, foundation models are being explored for their potential in music understanding, analysis, and even unconventional applications such as medical uses [5,7]. The core motivation is to expand creative boundaries and facilitate the production of emotionally resonant work [28].  

Despite the significant progress and potential, the field of foundation models for music faces several open questions and challenges. These include the need for improved music comprehension abilities [14], addressing the limitations of current models [14], and navigating complex ethical considerations [5,21,28]. Issues such as interpretability, transparency, human responsibility, artistic compensation, authorship, and copyright are critical areas requiring careful consideration as AI's role in creative enterprise expands [5,21]. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of music foundation models, examining state-of-the-art pre-trained and foundation models [5,29]. We will explore key topics including architectures, training methods, representation learning, generative learning, multimodal learning, and practical application cases [5,29]. Furthermore, we will highlight future challenges and trends, aiming to offer insights that can shape the trajectory of research and human-AI collaboration in the music domain [5,14].  

# 2. Background and Evolution of AI in Music  

![](images/749767e91d91650195a6d0f6d17bee0ebdd73f2abe91cc824d8d792d6416cfee.jpg)  

The integration of artificial intelligence into music creation and processing represents a significant evolution, tracing its roots back several decades. Early efforts in music AI were characterized by rule‐based systems, with algorithmic composition emerging in the 1950s, exemplified by works like “Illiac Suite for String Quartet” [9,24]. These methods relied on predefined rules derived from musical theory to generate compositions [11]. While foundational, rule‐based systems often faced limitations in terms of creativity and expressiveness, struggling to produce diverse or novel musical content beyond the scope of their explicit programming [11]. Although AI and machine learning have gained considerable attention more recently, it is noteworthy that the controllability and quality achieved by some earlier algorithmic methods sometimes surpassed those of subsequent AI techniques in specific contexts [22].​  

Following the rule‐based era, the field transitioned towards statistical models and early machine learning techniques [28], marking a shift towards systems capable of learning from data rather than solely relying on explicit rules. This period saw the intersection of AI and music begin to gain traction [20], contributing to the evolution of the musical landscape alongside technological advancements [20]. The notion of an “AI composer” began to seem warranted as these techniques achieved initial successes [20].  

The rise of deep learning marked a pivotal moment in music AI. Deep learning methods, utilizing neural networks, learn patterns and structures from large music datasets, offering the potential for superior generation quality and diversity compared to earlier approaches [11,23]. Architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and more recently, Transformer models, have been successfully applied to various music tasks, including generation [9]. Modern models like Meta's MusicGen, based on the Transformer architecture, predict music segments akin to language models predicting text, and utilize techniques like audio tokenization (e.g., EnCodec) for processing [9,18]. Other examples include OpenAI's MuseNet [9]. Despite these advancements, deep learning methods present challenges, including complex training processes and potential issues like mode collapse, where the model fails to capture the full diversity of the training data [11]. Furthermore, previous methods have been noted for insufficient flexibility in various music applications [7] and have often not fully explored the myriad methods of musical expression [7]. A notable limitation highlighted in recent work is the primary focus on generating pure melodies, leaving a gap in simultaneously generating elements like lyrics [4].​  

Foundation models are positioned as the next significant step in this evolutionary trajectory [5]. By leveraging vast datasets and scalable architectures, these models aim to overcome the limitations of previous methods, particularly the lack of versatility and flexibility across diverse music applications [5,7]. Their development signifies a new transformation in the field, potentially enabling more comprehensive and adaptable music creation and analysis tools [15].​  

# 3. Fundamentals of Foundation Models for Music  

Foundation models for music represent a significant advancement in the field, leveraging large-scale data and sophisticated deep learning architectures to understand, process, and generate musical content [1,2,5]. Understanding these models necessitates an analysis of their core components: the data modalities and representations they utilize, the diverse model architectures employed, and the training paradigms that enable their capabilities.  

Foundation models for music operate on various data modalities, reflecting the multifaceted nature of musical information. These primarily include audio (waveforms), symbolic (e.g., MIDI), and text (e.g., lyrics, descriptions) [1,2,5]. Audio provides a rich, complete representation but is computationally demanding [2], while symbolic formats offer structured, interpretable data efficient for tasks like composition but lack expressive nuance [1,2,20]. Text serves as a crucial interface for incorporating lyrics or controlling generation [1]. Visual representations are also used, particularly for analysis or as multimodal inputs [2,18,31]. Effective representation learning is critical, with specific techniques like SongComposer's tuple design and logarithmic encoding for durations in symbolic data  

$$
b = \lfloor \frac { \log ( x + \epsilon ) } { \log ( \rho ) } \rfloor
$$  

and  

$$
x = \rho ^ { b } - \epsilon
$$  

demonstrating efforts to capture complex musical structures efficiently [3,4,13,25]. Multimodal approaches, integrating different data types, present both opportunities for more versatile models and significant challenges in learning shared representations and ensuring temporal and semantic alignment [5]. Underexplored areas include highly nuanced performance expressions, detailed timbral control, and rich annotations of musical structure [5].  

The architectural landscape of music foundation models is diverse, drawing from advancements in deep learning [1,5,19,23]. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) excel at capturing temporal dependencies essential for sequential music data [2,9]. Transformers, leveraging self-attention, are widely adopted for their ability to model long-range dependencies and global structures, overcoming limitations of traditional RNNs [2,11,19]. Many recent models, including those based on Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA and InternLM, utilize Transformer backbones [4,6,16,26]. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are effective for generating high-quality audio and style transfer through an adversarial process [2], while Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) learn structured latent spaces enabling manipulations like style mixing [2]. Diffusion Models, notably DiffWave, Riffusion, and Stable Audio, represent a prominent emerging paradigm for high-fidelity audio synthesis, often exhibiting stable training and superior quality compared to GANs [11,19]. Hybrid architectures, such as Jukebox combining diffusion with a Transformer, are explored for complex tasks like multi-track generation [11]. The choice of architecture impacts a model's strengths, with RNN/LSTMs strong in local temporal dynamics, Transformers in global structure, GANs in perceptual realism, and VAEs in latent space control.​  

The training paradigms employed are crucial for developing the capabilities of these models [1,5]. A common and effective approach involves pre-training on extensive datasets, such as SongComposer's pre-training on SongCompose-PT, to learn fundamental musical structures and language patterns [3,4,13,25]. Objectives include next-token prediction, often paired with data augmentation like pitch transposition [3,4]. This is typically followed by supervised fine-tuning on instructionfollowing data to adapt the pre-trained model for diverse downstream tasks like lyric-to-melody or text-to-song generation [3,4,25]. Other specialized paradigms include contrastive learning for robust representation (e.g., COLA, CLAP) and adversarial or reinforcement learning for style transfer or preference correction [1,6,19]. The nature and diversity of the training data significantly influence the stylistic output and generalization ability of the model [10]. While not always explicitly leveraging traditional music theory, these models learn musical structures and patterns implicitly through the  

design of their representations, architectures, and training objectives, enabling them to generate coherent and musically plausible outputs.  

In summary, the fundamentals of music foundation models lie in the strategic integration of appropriate data modalities and representations, the selection and adaptation of powerful deep learning architectures suited to sequential and complex data, and the implementation of effective training paradigms, predominantly large-scale pre-training followed by finetuning [1,5]. The interplay of these elements dictates the models' ability to capture musical structures, generate novel content, and address specific music generation tasks, while ongoing research continues to explore multimodal challenges and refine representation and training techniques.​  

# 3.1 Modalities and Representations  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Modality</td><td>Description& FormatStrengths</td><td></td><td>Weaknesses / Challenges</td></tr><tr><td>Audio</td><td>Waveforms (MP3, WAV)</td><td>Rich,complete (timbre,dynamics, nuances)</td><td>Computationally intensive, signal processing</td></tr><tr><td>Symbolic</td><td>Discrete events (MIDI, ABC notation)</td><td>Structured, interpretable, efficient</td><td>Lacks performance nuance</td></tr><tr><td>Text</td><td>Lyrics,descriptions</td><td>Intuitive for human control</td><td>Alignment with musical structure</td></tr><tr><td>Visual</td><td>Chromagrams, scores (OMR), images</td><td>Analytical views, specific inputs</td><td>Can obscure details (e.g., chromagrams)</td></tr><tr><td>Multimodal</td><td>Combinations (e.g., Audio + Text)</td><td>Versatile,aligns with real world inputs</td><td>Learning shared reps, temporal/semantic alignment</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Foundation models for music leverage various data modalities, primarily including audio, symbolic, and text, to capture the multifaceted nature of musical information [1,2,5]. Visual representations also play a role, particularly for analysis or specific inputs [2,18,23,31].​  

Audio data, typically in waveform files like MP3, offers a rich and complete representation of music, encompassing timbre, dynamics, and performance nuances [2,19]. However, processing raw audio waveforms is computationally intensive and requires sophisticated signal processing techniques to extract relevant features [2]. Audio-based models, such as MERT, focus on learning representations directly from audio [16]. Approaches like semantic-enhanced audio tokenizers aim to improve the model's understanding of musical content within the audio signal, particularly when linked with other modalities like lyrics [6].​  

Symbolic representations, such as MIDI or ABC notation, abstract music into discrete events like note pitch, duration, and velocity [1,2,20]. This structured format is highly interpretable and efficient for tasks like composition, arrangement, and editing [9,20,25]. Large datasets of MIDI files are readily available for training AI models [20]. Common encoding schemes for symbolic data include piano rolls, one-hot encoding, and representations incorporating chords and silences [23]. A key limitation of symbolic data is its inability to fully capture expressive performance details inherent in audio [25]. Despite this, conversion from audio formats like MP3 to symbolic formats like MIDI is a common preprocessing step for some models [9].  

Text modality is frequently used for incorporating lyrics, generating music from textual descriptions, or controlling generation parameters [1]. While text provides an intuitive interface for human interaction, aligning textual concepts with musical structures remains a challenge.  

Visual representations can provide analytical views or serve as specific input types. Chromagrams, for instance, visualize prominent notes over time, aiding in melody visualization, although they have limitations in capturing melodic direction and octave information and can be obscured by percussive or bass elements [18]. Images of musical instruments like violins can serve as visual inputs in multimodal contexts [31]. Optical Music Recognition (OMR) converts musical score images into digital symbolic representations [2].​  

Different foundation models leverage these modalities in various ways. Some models are designed for single modalities, while others integrate multiple inputs [1]. Multimodal models, such as those integrating audio and symbolic representations, are being explored [16]. The combination of textual lyrics and musical elements (often symbolic) is a common multimodal application in music generation.​  

SongComposer, for instance, distinguishes itself by focusing on symbolic representations of both lyrics and melody, contrasting with models that process music as quantized audio signals [25]. This symbolic approach is deemed more efficient and flexible for music creation, particularly for aligning lyrics and melody in a human-understandable format [4,25].  

<figure-link title $= ^ { \prime }$ SongComposer's Tuple Design Representation' type $\mathrel { \mathop : } \mathbf { \Gamma }$ mermaid' content='graph LR\n    A["Musical Unit"] -- > B("Tuple { ... }");\n    B --> C1["Lyric Word Token"];\n    B - $\phantom { 0 } . . >$ C2["Melody Pitch"];\n    B -- $. >$ C3["Note Duration"];\n    B --> C4["Rest Duration"];\n    B -- Can be $\phantom { 0 } { - } \mathrm { > }$ D1["Lyric-only Tuple"];\n    B -- Can be $\phantom { 0 } { - } \to$ D2["Melody-only Tuple"];\n    B -- Can be --> D3["Lyric-Melody Pair Tuple"]; $^ { 1 } > < ,$ /figure-link>​  

SongComposer employs a novel tuple design to structure input data [3,13,17]. Each tuple represents a musical unit, which can be a lyric word, a melody element (pitch, note duration, rest duration), or a lyric-melody pair, facilitating precise alignment [3,4,13,17].  

To handle the continuous nature of duration in symbolic representation, SongComposer utilizes a logarithmic encoding scheme to discretize durations into a predefined number of bins [3,4,17]. The encoding process for a duration x is defined as  

$$
b = \lfloor \frac { \log ( x + \epsilon ) } { \log ( \rho ) } \rfloor
$$  

where $\rho = 1 . 0 0 2$ , the number of bins is 512, and $\epsilon = 1$ , enabling durations up to 6.3 seconds to be mapped to 512 discrete integers [3]. The inverse decoding formula is  

$$
x = \rho ^ { b } - \epsilon
$$  

[3]. This discretization allows the model to capture temporal variations effectively [17]. Furthermore, SongComposer expands its vocabulary with auxiliary tokens for these discrete time units and note values. This includes 512 unique tokens for time discretization and 120 distinct tokens representing 12 pitch classes across ten octaves, totaling 120 tokens for pitches [3,4,17].  

While audio, symbolic, text, and basic visual representations are explored, certain aspects of music representation remain less deeply integrated into current FM development. Highly nuanced performance expressions (e.g., microtiming deviations, complex vibrato), detailed timbral control beyond instrument class, or rich annotations of musical structure (e.g., harmonic analysis, formal structure) could be considered relatively underexplored compared to basic note/duration/text representations.  

Developing foundation models for multimodal music data presents significant challenges and opportunities [5]. Challenges include learning shared representations across disparate data types, ensuring temporal and semantic alignment between modalities (e.g., aligning lyrics with specific notes or audio events), and designing scalable model architectures capable of processing and generating coherent multimodal outputs [5]. Opportunities lie in creating models that are more versatile, capable of understanding and generating music in response to complex, real-world inputs spanning different modalities, thereby enabling richer forms of human-computer interaction and creative expression in music [5].​

Foundation models for music generation employ a diverse array of deep learning architectures to capture the complex structures and temporal dynamics inherent in musical data [1,5,19,23]. Popular architectures include Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), Transformers, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), sometimes combined with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or integrated within frameworks like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models [1,2,11,19,27].​  

RNNs and LSTMs are particularly well-suited for processing sequential data, making them advantageous for capturing temporal dependencies in music [2,9,11,20]. The recurrent nature of these networks allows them to maintain an internal state that encodes information about preceding elements in a sequence, which is crucial for generating coherent melodies and chord progressions where musical events are intrinsically linked over time [2,9,10]. For instance, a music generation model employing two LSTM layers with 256 units demonstrates this capability, leveraging LSTM's suitability for data with inherent temporal characteristics [9]. LSTM's "memory" aspect explicitly helps in accounting for time when encoding dynamic objects like musical scores [20].​  

Transformers, built upon the self-attention mechanism, have revolutionized sequential modeling by enabling the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence regardless of their distance [2,11,19]. This mechanism allows Transformers to effectively capture long-range dependencies and global structures in music, which is a limitation for traditional RNNs [2,11]. Consequently, Transformers are widely used for tasks requiring modeling complex structures and multi-instrument orchestration [2,15]. Many recent music foundation models are based on Transformer architectures, including LLMs adapted for music generation, which inherit the Transformer's ability to handle complex relationships [16,26]. Specific examples include models based on LLaMA/LLaMA2, such as YuE [6,12], and models based on InternLM-7B, such as SongComposer [4,13]. OpenAI's MuseNet is another example of a Transformer-based model capable of generating multi-instrument music [19].​  

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) excel at learning high-dimensional data distributions through an adversarial training process involving a generator and a discriminator [2,27]. The generator creates data samples (e.g., audio waveforms), while the discriminator attempts to distinguish real data from generated data. This competitive process iteratively improves the generator's ability to produce realistic outputs, making GANs suitable for high-quality audio generation and style transfer [2,11]. MuseGAN is a specific instance utilizing GANs for multi-track music generation [11].  

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are generative models that learn a compressed latent representation of the input data [2,23]. They consist of an encoder that maps input data to a latent space and a decoder that reconstructs the data from this space [2]. This latent space captures meaningful features of the music, enabling tasks such as latent space interpolation for music style mixing and transposition [2]. MusicVAE is a notable VAE-based model used within frameworks like Magenta for learning latent representations of musical scores and exploring relationships between melodies [10,20].​  

Beyond these core architectures, Diffusion Models and WaveNet are increasingly used for direct high-quality audio synthesis, overcoming limitations of traditional MIDI-based generation [19,31]. Some music foundation models also incorporate CNN encoders alongside Transformer encoders and decoders to adapt to different music application scenarios [1]. Meta's MusicGen combines text and image prompts, likely utilizing a multimodal architecture that integrates aspects of these different models for cross-media music creation [19]. Each architecture presents distinct strengths, with RNN/LSTMs excelling at local temporal dynamics, Transformers capturing global dependencies, GANs focusing on perceptual realism, and VAEs providing structured latent spaces for manipulation, often combined or adapted to suit the specific requirements of various music generation tasks.​  

# 3.3 Diffusion Models  

Diffusion models represent a significant advancement in generative modeling, increasingly applied in the domain of music and audio synthesis. Compared to other generative paradigms such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models have been posited to offer advantages in terms of training stability, generation quality, and modeling flexibility [11]. This makes them particularly well-suited for the complex task of generating coherent and high-fidelity audio.  

Several prominent diffusion-based models have emerged in the music and audio generation landscape. DiffWave, for instance, is recognized as a typical algorithm specifically designed for audio generation, capable of producing high-quality audio clips [11]. More recent models, such as Riffusion and Stable Audio, also leverage diffusion techniques to achieve professional-grade audio synthesis, demonstrated by their ability to generate 44.1kHz stereo audio outputs [19]. Beyond simple audio clips, diffusion models are being employed for more complex musical structures. Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), mentioned as part of foundational model landscapes [1], offer a potential architectural approach for efficiency.  

A notable example showcasing the capabilities of diffusion models in music generation is Jukebox [11]. Jukebox is designed for generating multi-track music, a complex task requiring coordination across different instrumental or vocal layers [11]. Its architecture represents a hybrid approach, combining a diffusion model with a Transformer network [11]. The core principle behind Jukebox's design is to utilize the diffusion model for the generative process itself, while the Transformer is employed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in musical structure [11]. This combination enables Jukebox to generate not just individual audio streams but integrated, multi-track musical pieces, highlighting the modeling flexibility achievable through the synergistic application of different neural network architectures within a diffusion framework. These models collectively demonstrate the power and versatility of diffusion models for generating diverse forms of high-quality music and audio.  

# 3.4 Training Paradigms  

![](images/1eeeea2a5439262717fbb61f1cbc649606570f6ebcc96972c200d02d56bcafbd.jpg)  

The development of music foundation models is critically influenced by the chosen training paradigms, which dictate how models learn from data and ultimately shape their performance and capabilities [5]. A diverse range of training approaches is employed in the field [1], including contrastive learning, self-supervised learning, and diffusion models [1].  

A prominent paradigm involves pre-training on large-scale datasets [1], the objectives and techniques of which are foundational [5,7]. For instance, the SongComposer model undergoes pre-training on SongCompose-PT, a substantial dataset comprising lyrics, melodies, and paired lyric-melody data [3,4,13,25]. This pre-training often utilizes a next-token prediction task on large corpora of pure lyrics and melodies to build a foundational understanding of musical structures and language [3,4]. Data augmentation techniques, such as pitch transposition for melodies, are frequently applied during pretraining to enhance robustness and generalization [3,4,17]. Some models, like YuE, adopt more complex pre-training strategies involving multiple tasks and phases to achieve better convergence and generalization [6,12]. Training large models, potentially on trillions of tokens, signifies the trend towards leveraging massive datasets [16].  

Following pre-training, a common practice is supervised fine-tuning on instruction-following data [3,4,17,25]. This two-stage approach, exemplified by SongComposer [3,4,17], empowers the pre-trained model with the capability to handle diverse  

downstream tasks such as lyric-to-melody generation, melody-to-lyric generation, song continuation, and text-to-song synthesis [3,13,17,25]. Instruction-following data can be manually prepared or generated using models like GPT-4 [3,17]. Other specialized training paradigms address specific challenges. Contrastive learning models like COLA and CLAP, for instance, learn robust representations by comparing and contrasting similar and dissimilar music examples [1,29]. Adversarial training is utilized for tasks like style transfer, allowing models to generate music with desired stylistic attributes [19]. Reinforcement learning can be employed for preference correction, fine-tuning model outputs to better align with human aesthetic judgments [6].​  

The choice of training data profoundly impacts the resulting model's output and capabilities [10]. A model trained on a dataset of specific genres, such as bluegrass or Gregorian plainchant, will produce results characteristic of that style, whereas training on a large, diverse dataset of Western music, like that used for Magenta Studio tools, tends to yield more generic outputs [10]. For audio-based generation, models learn relationships between text and sound by training on large databases of music paired with text descriptions [18]. Training MusicGen with text descriptions and corresponding melodies teaches it to generate complete pieces conditioned on a given melody and text prompt [18]. While the explicit discussion of novel regularization techniques is limited in the digests, the emphasis on large datasets and specific optimization methods like AdamW [4] indicates the technical rigor involved in training these extensive models.​  

# 4. Music Generation with Foundation Models  

Foundation models are increasingly being leveraged to push the boundaries of automated music generation, moving beyond traditional rule-based and statistical approaches toward sophisticated data-driven techniques [22,26].  

![](images/e6f46bf82b86b3652b7ef354d070204b3f71ae685fd4102635702d611adf4012.jpg)  

This domain encompasses the creation of various musical elements—from discrete symbolic representations like melodies, harmonies, and chord progressions [2,9,13,17,25,26] to complex, continuous audio waveforms [6,19]. Large Language Models (LLMs), originally designed for text processing, are adapted by learning from music data to understand musical structures and generate novel content that adheres to musical rules [26].​  

One primary area is Symbolic Music Generation, which focuses on discrete representations such as MIDI. Early methods evolved from statistical models to deep learning architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer networks (e.g., Music Transformer, MusicVAE, MuseNet), enabling the generation of diverse compositions and multiinstrument ensembles [2,10,20,22,29]. A complex task within this domain is Lyric and Melody Co-Composition, which demands the simultaneous creation and precise alignment of lyrical content and musical melodies. Models like SongComposer utilize novel integrated representations to address this challenge [4,13,25]. Despite progress, challenges remain in ensuring musicality, coherence, and originality, and robust evaluation methods are needed—particularly for integrated tasks [3,4,13,19,20,25].  

Another significant domain is Audio Music Generation, which involves synthesizing musical waveforms directly. This process is computationally intensive, requiring models like autoregressive networks (WaveNet), GANs, and diffusion models (Riffusion, Stable Audio, Jukebox, JukeMIR, MusicGen) [2,6,18,29]. Key challenges include managing computational resources, generating high-fidelity audio, controlling complex signal processing, and maintaining coherence over long durations [6]. Lyrics-to-Song Creation is an important application that bridges these domains, wherein models convert lyrical input into complete musical pieces—with potential inclusion of vocals and accompaniment. Models like YuE are specifically designed for this task, focusing on long-form generation, multi-language and multi-style support, and maintaining lyrical alignment [6,12,13,16]. This task highlights the need for integrating linguistic understanding with musical generation capabilities.​  

The integration of audio and symbolic representations is an active area of research, as models explore how to leverage the strengths of both. Symbolic representations provide precise control over musical parameters, while audio captures the nuances of timbre and expression. Some models process one format to generate the other, or even generate elements in both domains.​  

Evaluating the performance of these diverse generation models requires a combination of objective metrics and subjective human assessments, considering aspects like musicality, coherence, originality, quality, and adherence to musical rules [3,4,13,19,20,25]. A significant challenge across domains is long-form music generation, where maintaining structural coherence and a musical narrative over extended durations is particularly difficult. Techniques like structural progressive conditioning and chain-of-thought generation are being explored to address this challenge [6,12]. Text-to-music generation further allows users to create music from textual descriptions, with models like MusicGen demonstrating the ability to generate music based on mood, genre, or even reference melodies [15,18,27].​  

Finally, the role of human intervention remains crucial. While models can generate music autonomously, they are increasingly used as tools for assisted creation, enabling artists to generate ideas, modify outputs, and collaborate with AI systems to produce fresh works [2,8,10,24,28]. This evolving collaboration points to a future where foundation models serve as powerful co-creators in the musical process. Addressing the current challenges in coherence, control, and evaluation is key to fully unlocking the potential of foundation models for music generation.  

# 4.1 Symbolic Music Generation  

Symbolic music generation encompasses the automated creation of musical elements such as melodies, harmonies, and chord progressions using discrete representations like MIDI [20]. This field has seen a significant evolution from early rulebased systems and statistical models—including Markov models and methods leveraging statistical models and hierarchical structures [22]—towards modern approaches dominated by deep learning models [22]. Deep learning models typically generate music sequences by predicting subsequent notes or chords based on preceding context, often representing output as integer sequences converted back into musical elements [9].​  

Various deep learning architectures have been applied to symbolic music generation. Recurrent Neural Networks, particularly LSTMs, have been used for melody generation by modeling transition probabilities between notes [2]. Transformer networks and their variants, such as Music Transformer and MusicVAE, have also proven effective for processing and generating symbolic music data, allowing for the creation of diverse compositions [20,29]. Models like MuseNet extend this capability to generating multi-instrument ensembles with harmonies based on MIDI input [19]. Tools like Magenta Studio facilitate this process by allowing users to generate new melodic or rhythmic patterns, continue existing ones, or interpolate between sequences using MIDI data [10].​  

A notable and complex task within symbolic music generation is lyric and melody co-composition, which requires generating both lyrical content and a corresponding melody simultaneously while ensuring precise alignment and musical coherence [3,25]. The primary challenge here is the effective temporal and structural synchronization between linguistic units and musical events [4,13]. Foundation models are increasingly being developed to address this. SongComposer, for instance, utilizes a novel tuple design to jointly represent lyric tokens and associated musical attributes like pitch, duration, and rest duration [4,13,25]. This integrated representation aids the model in understanding the interplay between lyrics and music, facilitating coherent generation across tasks such as lyric-to-melody, melody-to-lyric, song continuation, and text-tosong [3,4,13,17]. Another model, YuE, tackles the lyrics-to-song challenge—particularly for long-form music—by employing structural progressive conditioning and a chain-of-thought generation approach to maintain coherence over extended musical structures [6,12].​  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Challenge</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Ensuring Musicality& Coherence</td><td>Generating outputs that sound musically plausible and flow well structurally</td></tr><tr><td>Originality</td><td>Producing novel compositions that are not simply reproductions of training data</td></tr><tr><td>Evaluation</td><td>Developing robust methods (esp.integrated metrics for co-composition)</td></tr><tr><td>Expressivity Control</td><td>Controlling high-level musical structure and nuanced performance details</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term Structure</td><td>Maintaining coherence and musical narrative overextended compositions</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Despite significant progress, symbolic music generation faces several challenges, including ensuring musicality, coherence, and originality in the generated outputs [20]. Evaluating the quality of generated symbolic music is also challenging. Traditional metrics often assess musical quality based on criteria like note accuracy, rhythmic complexity, and harmonic consistency [19,20]. However, for complex tasks like lyric and melody co-composition, there is a critical need for integrated metrics that evaluate not only the individual quality of lyrics and melody but also their interaction and alignment [3,4,13,25]. Controlling the expressivity and high-level musical structure of generated content remains an area of active research, although parameters like "temperature" offer some control over predictability [10]. The symbolic representation itself offers advantages in terms of direct control over musical parameters and compatibility with music editing software [19,20,29], but may abstract away nuances present in audio representations. Addressing these challenges—particularly improving long-term structure coherence, human-like expressivity, and developing robust evaluation methods—are key directions for future research in symbolic music generation.​  

# 4.1.1 Lyric and Melody Co-Composition  

Lyric and melody co-composition represents a complex task in generative music, requiring models to simultaneously create coherent lyrical content and musically fitting melodies while ensuring their precise alignment and interaction. A primary challenge in this domain is effectively handling the alignment between discrete linguistic units (lyrics) and continuous or symbolic musical elements (melody) over time [3,25].  

![](images/c09019cb3f2ce751e0be8d5b477a88a1cb1d1cd89f609254d42789027492b218.jpg)  

Different foundation models employ distinct strategies to address this critical alignment issue.  

One notable approach is implemented in SongComposer, an LLM specifically designed for lyric and melody co-composition [4,25]. SongComposer models the relationship between lyrics and melodies using a novel tuple design [4,13]. This design formats lyric tokens alongside specific note attributes, including pitch, duration, and rest duration [4,13]. This joint representation within a tuple structure is intended to ensure the correct understanding of musical symbols by the language model and facilitate precise alignment between the lyrical content and the generated melody [13,25]. The architecture and training process of SongComposer are tailored to generate lyric-melody pairs that are mutually coherent and musically engaging, demonstrating superior performance across tasks such as lyric-to-melody generation, melody-to-lyric generation, song continuation, and text-to-song creation [3,4,13,17].  

In contrast, YuE focuses on the lyrics-to-song problem, particularly for long-form music generation [12]. YuE addresses lyrical alignment over extended contexts using structural progressive conditioning [12]. Furthermore, it incorporates a chainof-thought generation technique to support the gradual generation of entire songs based on lyrics, aiming for coherence in the overall structure [6]. This contrasts with SongComposer's tuple-based method, representing an alternative strategy for managing the lyric-melody relationship, especially for longer musical pieces. Other systems may leverage NLP techniques like sentiment analysis to inform lyrical content based on musical style or mood [27], or language models like GPT-4 for generating rhyming and semantically/rhythmically appropriate lyrics [19], though the integration with melody generation and alignment varies. Early explorations like YACHT also experimented with generating both modalities [10].  

Evaluating the quality of lyric and melody co-composition presents significant challenges. Standard metrics often assess musical quality and lyrical quality independently. However, for co-composition, it is crucial to evaluate how well the two modalities interact and align [4,13]. There is a clear need for metrics that can effectively capture both the musical and lyrical attributes, as well as the synergy and precise synchronization between them, to accurately assess the overall quality of the generated songs [3,4,13,25]. Development of such integrated evaluation methodologies remains an active area for advancing the field.​  

# 4.2 Audio Music Generation  

Audio music generation encompasses the task of directly synthesizing musical waveforms, moving beyond symbolic representations like MIDI [6,19]. This challenging domain leverages foundation models to create complex audio signals that constitute complete musical pieces. Various techniques have been explored for this purpose, including autoregressive models such as WaveNet, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and diffusion models like Riffusion and Stable Audio [2,6,19]. Models like NSynth apply synthesis techniques directly to audio signals [10], while others like MusicGen represent dedicated efforts in this space [18]. Often, these methods utilize intermediate audio representations such as spectrograms, particularly in GAN-based approaches, before generating the final waveform [2].​  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Challenge</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Computational Cost</td><td>High resource demands for processing and generating high-resolution audio</td></tr><tr><td>High-Fidelity Synthesis</td><td>Achieving professional-grade audio quality (e.g.,44.1kHz stereo)</td></tr><tr><td>Signal Processing Control</td><td>Effectively controlling complex musical signal characteristics</td></tr><tr><td>Long-Term Coherence</td><td>Maintaining structural and musical coherence over extended durations</td></tr><tr><td>Linguistic Content Integrity</td><td>Preventing distortion of lyrics or vocal performance details in synthesis</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Significant challenges persist in audio music generation, including the substantial computational cost and memory requirements associated with processing high-resolution audio [19]. Generating high-quality, professional-grade audio, such as 44.1kHz stereo [19], remains a key technical hurdle. Furthermore, effectively controlling complex musical signal processing [22] and maintaining coherence over extended musical durations pose considerable difficulties [6]. Specific generation tasks, such as creating songs directly from lyrics [16], introduce unique challenges related to lyrical alignment, engaging melody generation, and preventing distortion of linguistic content within the synthesized audio [6].  

Evaluating the performance of these models requires a combination of objective metrics, such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS), and subjective evaluations based on human perception of audio quality, realism, and musicality [19]. Training strategies, including adversarial training [2], are crucial for optimizing model performance and fidelity. This section will delve into the architectural approaches, representations, challenges, and evaluation methodologies central to advancing the field of audio music generation.  

# 4.2.1 Lyrics-to-Song Creation  

Foundation models are increasingly enabling the transformation of lyrical input into complete musical pieces, encompassing both instrumental accompaniment and vocal melodies. This capability allows researchers and creators to generate full-fledged songs directly from textual descriptions or existing lyrics.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Capability</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Comprehensive Output</td><td>Generates full songs including vocals and accompaniment</td></tr><tr><td>Multi-language Support</td><td>Supports English, Chinese,Japanese, Korean</td></tr><tr><td>Multi-style Support</td><td>Generates various styles (pop, metal, jazz, hip-hop,etc.)</td></tr><tr><td>Long-form Generation</td><td>Creates complete songs up to five minutes long</td></tr><tr><td>Lyrical Alignment</td><td>Maintains coherence and alignment between lyrics and music throughout the song</td></tr><tr><td>Engaging Melodies</td><td>Focuses on creating appealing and musically appropriate vocal melodies</td></tr></table></body></html>  

A notable example in this domain is YuE, an open foundation model specifically designed for lyrics-to-song creation [6,12].  

YuE is engineered to convert lyrics into comprehensive songs, incorporating both vocals and accompaniment. It supports multiple languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and can generate music in various styles such as pop, metal, jazz, and hip-hop [6]. A key feature of YuE is its capability to generate long-form music, producing complete songs up to five minutes in length [6,12]. The model is designed to maintain lyrical alignment throughout the generated piece and create coherent musical structures with engaging vocal melodies [6,12]. Technically, YuE is described as a 9 billion parameter model trained on trillions of tokens [16], indicating a significant scale intended to capture complex musical and linguistic patterns. The development of YuE explicitly addresses challenges inherent in this task, such as handling long contexts, processing complex music signals, and preventing the distortion of linguistic content [6]. It can also match the emotional tone conveyed by the lyrics to the generated music style [6].​  

Another model contributing to the lyrics-to-song domain is SongComposer [13]. SongComposer is also utilized for lyrics-tosong creation and demonstrates strong performance in generating coherent musical structures and engaging vocal melodies [13].​  

Comparing these approaches, both YuE and SongComposer aim to produce coherent musical structures and engaging vocal melodies from lyrics, highlighting these as critical aspects of successful lyrics-to-song generation [6,12,13]. However, YuE's described capabilities offer greater detail, emphasizing its support for long-form generation up to five minutes [6,12], multilanguage and multi-style generation [6], and the inclusion of both vocals and accompaniment [6]. While SongComposer is noted for generating structure and melody [13], the digests do not specify its duration capabilities, language/style support, or whether it generates full arrangements or primarily symbolic representations. YuE's larger scale (9B parameters, trillions of tokens) [16] and explicit mention of addressing long context [6] suggest a focus on tackling the complexities of generating extended, structured music while maintaining lyrical fidelity.​  

The development of such models underscores key challenges in lyrics-to-song creation. These include accurately maintaining lyrical coherence and alignment over extended musical durations [6,12], generating vocal melodies that are both engaging and appropriately matched to the lyrics and musical style [6,12,13], and handling the technical complexities of generating long-form music with intricate structures and diverse instrumentation [6]. Overcoming issues like the distortion of linguistic content within the generated audio is also crucial for producing high-quality results [6].​  

# 5. Music Understanding with Foundation Models  

Foundation models are increasingly being explored for their potential in music understanding, aiming to replicate human comprehension of musical elements and provide related services through artificial intelligence techniques [5,7,14]. This involves analyzing and interpreting music data to understand its inherent structure and characteristics [29]. AI's ability to interpret musical elements such as rhythm, harmony, and melody—and potentially capture human-like emotional depth—is a key focus in this domain [28]. Such understanding is crucial for various downstream applications, including modern music recommendation systems employed by platforms like Spotify and Apple Music [27].  

Pre-trained audio models like MERT are utilized for audio-based music understanding [16]. Contrastive learning models are frequently employed for music understanding tasks [1], with notable examples including Music Tokeniser, MULE, and CLAP, which are used to analyze and understand music data [29]. These models are applied across various Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks such as music emotion analysis, style recognition, and music feature extraction [1].  

While the subsection description highlights the importance of analyzing model architectures and training objectives, and comparing different fine-tuning strategies, the provided digests do not offer detailed insights into these specific aspects for music foundation models.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Challenge</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Polyphony</td><td>Interpreting intricate interplay of multiple simultaneous sounds</td></tr><tr><td>Complex Timbres</td><td>Analyzing rich variations in instrument and vocal qualities</td></tr><tr><td>Cultural Biases</td><td>Navigating diverse cultural contexts shaping musical expression and perception</td></tr><tr><td>Nuance Capture</td><td>Fully capturing subtle human-like emotional depth and expressiveness</td></tr><tr><td>Evaluation</td><td>Developing methods to replicate human comprehension accuracy</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Addressing the complexities of music understanding presents significant challenges, including dealing with polyphony, complex timbres, and cultural biases. Effectively interpreting the intricate interplay of multiple sounds, the rich variations in instrument and vocal qualities, and the diverse cultural contexts that shape musical expression are crucial hurdles for foundation models in this field.  

Despite these challenges, foundation models have demonstrated promising performance compared to previous state-of-theart methods. For instance, YuE's learned representations have shown strong performance on music understanding tasks, matching or exceeding state-of-the-art results on the MARBLE benchmark [12]. The evaluation of foundation models on various music understanding benchmarks is essential for assessing their capabilities and progress [1,29]. While these models show improvements in performance, their specific limitations in fully capturing the nuances of human musical understanding across all complexities remain an active area of research.​  

In summary, foundation models represent a significant advancement in music understanding, leveraging pre-training and contrastive learning approaches for various MIR tasks. Although specific architectural details, training procedures, and finetuning strategies are not extensively detailed in the provided materials, the demonstrated performance of models like YuE on benchmarks suggests their growing efficacy in the field. Further research is needed to fully address the inherent complexities of music and explore the capabilities and limitations of these models more comprehensively.  

# 6. Controllability and Creativity  

The development of foundation models for music generation necessitates a critical examination of controllability, which refers to the ability of users to steer the generation process towards desired outcomes. This aspect is crucial for ensuring that AI systems serve as effective tools for creative expression rather than mere sources of random output [5,23]. Techniques for achieving controllability include the use of prompts (such as text or even image prompts), conditioning signals based on existing musical elements, and interactive interfaces [19]. For instance, models like MusicGen utilize text and image prompts to guide generation, although strict adherence to prompts is not always guaranteed, with the model often providing its unique interpretation while reflecting the requested genre and melody [18,19]. Advanced models like YuE offer flexible control through parameters for style and vocal type and enable versatile style transfer and bidirectional generation, with  

fine-tuning providing additional control granularities [6,12]. Interactive controls, such as a "Temperature" setting, are also employed in tools like Magenta Studio and in mashup generation systems to influence the predictability and feel of the output, allowing users to adjust the balance between structure and randomness [10,20].  

![](images/cb329cedd9a697ff58ab2954b5df4898a46a2555cf4ee778695ce8a01a8e766f.jpg)  

A fundamental challenge in AI music generation is managing the inherent trade-off between controllability and creativity [5]. While high controllability ensures the output aligns closely with user intent, it risks producing predictable or "robotic" music, potentially limiting novel or surprising outcomes [27]. Conversely, prioritizing creativity often involves incorporating elements of unpredictability, which can lead to highly original results but may deviate significantly from specified requirements [10,22]. Effective systems seek to blend control with unpredictability, enabling creative exploration while providing users with sufficient guidance mechanisms [28].​

Foundation models serve as powerful tools for augmenting human creativity and assisting musicians in their compositional process [20,28]. AI can expand creative boundaries and possibilities in music creation by providing unique sound combinations, faster idea development, and assisting non-musicians [8,21,28]. Systems can potentially detect subtle musical nuances and combine them in innovative ways, as suggested by the influence of parameters like "temperature" on the "feel" of generated music [20]. Examples like SongComposer demonstrate the ability of AI to generate harmonious melodies and lyrics, mimicking human composition [4]. This augmentation can help musicians break out of habitual patterns and explore new directions [10,24]. However, it is essential to acknowledge AI's limitations, potential biases, and ethical considerations, such as the use of artists' voices, when leveraging it as a creative tool [8,21,24]. Despite challenges like the risk of homogenization and loss of human expression, AI also offers benefits like democratizing music creation and reducing reliance on traditional resources [8,9].​  

The potential for human-AI collaboration represents a significant paradigm shift in music creation, where humans and AI models work together to produce novel and innovative music [9,28]. This collaborative approach aims to empower musicians and novices alike, allowing them to unleash creative potential [9]. Successful human-AI collaboration requires carefully balancing human direction with AI's automated capabilities to avoid overly artificial results [27]. Furthermore, the design of intuitive interfaces and integrated tools is critical to allow musicians to seamlessly integrate AI into their existing creative workflows and processes [9].​  

# 7. Applications and Use Cases  

![](images/08618ae0e5250dcc9ebd4c9916926e38021b9ed66d74d25633d30c5ab4e54d23.jpg)  

Foundation models (FMs) are significantly expanding the landscape of music applications, transforming how music is created, consumed, and interacted with [1,27]. This section provides a comprehensive overview of these applications, ranging from enhancing creative workflows to personalizing listening experiences and addressing critical ethical considerations.​  

A primary area of impact is in music creation and arrangement. FMs serve as powerful tools for composers and arrangers, streamlining processes, offering creative inspiration, and automating repetitive tasks [8,9,19]. They facilitate the generation of original musical content, including melodies, harmonies, rhythms, and even complete songs from textual descriptions or existing inputs [1,3,4,9,15,17]. Furthermore, FMs enable sophisticated music style transfer, allowing transformations across genres while preserving key musical elements [2,6,19]. This creative assistance extends to film and game scoring, where FMs can generate atmospheric background music and dynamic sound effects [2,11,15]. The development of new musical instruments and real-time performance systems integrating AI also represents an innovative application space [22,24,27,28].  

Beyond creation, FMs are instrumental in personalizing music consumption. They drive personalized music recommendation systems, create adaptive music experiences tailored to user preferences, activities, or emotional states, and enable dynamic playlist curation [1,2,6,11,19,27].  

A notable application area is the development of intelligent music agents. These agents, powered by FMs, are designed to perform complex musical tasks such as composing, arranging, and potentially performing music autonomously or in collaboration with humans [5,7].  

The accessibility provided by FM-powered tools holds significant potential for democratizing music creation, lowering the technical and theoretical barriers for individuals without extensive formal training to engage in creating music [8,9,18,20,27]  

Furthermore, FMs are finding applications in related domains such as music education and potentially music therapy [1,2,5,7,15,21]. In education, they can assist with teaching music theory, practice, and creative exploration. While still an emerging area, the potential for FMs to support therapeutic interventions through personalized musical interaction is being explored.  

Integral to the discussion of these applications are the ethical implications. The widespread use of AI in music raises critical questions concerning copyright ownership of AI-generated content, the potential for bias amplification embedded in training data, and the evolving role of human creativity in a landscape increasingly populated by AI co-creators [7,9]. Addressing these challenges, including ensuring responsible use, establishing appropriate frameworks for compensation and consent, and maintaining human oversight, is crucial for the sustainable and equitable integration of FMs into the music ecosystem [21].​  

Current challenges span technical limitations, such as achieving high levels of musicality and coherence without extensive post-processing, and ethical hurdles related to intellectual property and bias [4,9]. Future research needs to focus on developing more controllable and nuanced generation models, establishing clear ethical guidelines, and exploring the optimal synergistic relationship between human artists and AI tools across all application domains.​  

# 7.1 Music Composition and Arrangement  

![](images/5a8d6ec43a2bd911ba000590449d8fcd20425925cc7a01979363fefaca20db28.jpg)

Foundation models are increasingly being utilized as sophisticated tools for music composers and arrangers, offering capabilities that streamline workflows, provide creative inspiration, and generate diverse musical variations [9]. These AIpowered tools simplify the intricate process of music creation, facilitating the generation of new tracks from simple concepts to complete songs [8].​  

A key function of these models is providing inspiration. Tools like AIVA and Amper Music offer AI composition plugins capable of quickly generating preliminary musical fragments, serving as creative starting points for composers [19]. Similarly, machine learning techniques can be employed to generate unique, mashed-up musical scores that act as a creative spark for musicians and songwriters [20]. Generative models specifically are used to produce novel musical works, including complex melodies, harmonies, and rhythms [1,9]. Models such as SongComposer demonstrate versatility by generating melodies, harmonies, and lyrics, enabling the creation of full songs or arrangements from text descriptions or existing material [3,4,17]. Text-to-music tools like Mustango further exemplify this, translating linguistic descriptions into musical outputs [15].​  

Beyond inspiration, foundation models facilitate the generation of variations and the automation of repetitive tasks [9]. Models can generate variations by extending existing songs or creating diverse musical scores based on learned patterns [17,20]. Automation is evident in tools designed to handle specific production aspects, such as LANDR's AI Mastering service which automates mixing and mastering processes [19]. Composition tools also automate the generation of musical components; for instance, YuE can transform lyrics into complete songs comprising both vocals and accompaniment [6]. Magenta Studio offers tools like Drumify, which automates the creation of percussion tracks based on the groove of an input clip, and Groove, which assists in arrangement by adjusting timing and velocity to impart a more "humanized" feel to musical clips, drawing on datasets of real drummer performances [10]. The creation process can be guided using computational methods, such as employing hierarchical structures for song generation [22].  

These advancements hold significant potential for democratizing music creation. By simplifying complex tasks and providing intuitive interfaces, AI music generators make the creation of music more accessible, potentially allowing individuals without extensive musical training to create their own tracks or explore musical ideas [8,20]. This expanded accessibility can broaden participation in music creation beyond traditional boundaries.​  

The benefits of integrating AI-powered tools into music composition and production are substantial [19]. They include accelerated content generation, access to novel creative ideas, automation of tedious production steps, and increased accessibility for novice creators [3,8,17,19,20]. Specific tools offer unique advantages, such as generating musically specific rhythmic variations or humanizing performances [10]. However, limitations also exist. While AI models can generate original musical works, these often require further refinement using post-processing techniques to enhance their musicality and coherence [9]. Technical challenges persist, such as effectively aligning generated melodies with lyrics while maintaining efficiency, as highlighted by research addressing token usage in language model-based music generation [4]. The artistic depth, emotional nuance, and intentionality inherent in human composition remain complex areas for AI replication, often necessitating human oversight and creative direction to transform raw AI output into polished, expressive musical pieces.  

# 7.2 Music Style Transfer and Personalization  

![](images/572f26b371ce114e208227eb25d43e5725c353fb3f955c0911a06c113a7b3411.jpg)  

Foundation models have demonstrated significant capabilities in music style transfer, enabling the transformation of musical compositions across diverse genres and characteristics [2]. These models can learn the stylistic nuances inherent in different musical traditions and apply them to new or existing material. For instance, AI-driven systems can convert a piece composed in a popular music style into a Baroque rendition [19]. Advanced models such as YuE showcase versatile style transfer abilities, allowing complex transformations like converting a Japanese city pop track into English rap while carefully preserving elements such as the original accompaniment [12]. This indicates the models' capacity to disentangle and manipulate different musical attributes, such as melodic lines, rhythmic patterns, and instrumental textures, corresponding to specific styles.​  

Beyond style transfer, foundation models are pivotal in creating highly personalized music experiences [27]. They can generate music tailored to individual preferences, activities, or even emotional states. A notable application is the generation of music that aligns with the emotional tone expressed in lyrics [6]. By analyzing lyrical content, models like YuE can produce accompanying music that enhances or reflects the intended mood. Furthermore, personalized music consumption platforms leverage AI to curate dynamic experiences. For example, features like Spotify's AI DJ analyze a user's listening history to generate personalized playlists, effectively adapting the musical selection to evolving tastes and contexts [19].​  

# 7.3 Music Education and Therapy  

![](images/b10c7772623b03eb6289700b2c48c285eb16e736b1c8ef789be72cd67c4dc23f.jpg)  

Foundation models and related AI technologies are increasingly finding applications within music education, offering novel methods to enhance student learning and engagement. These models can contribute to providing personalized instruction and feedback by acting as sophisticated tools that supplement traditional teaching methods. For instance, dedicated educational resources like the Generative Music AI Course are designed to help students understand and master cuttingedge music technology, integrating AI concepts directly into the curriculum [15]. Furthermore, these technologies can foster creativity and practical application. Projects involving machine learning for generating unique MIDI compositions demonstrate the potential to pique students' interest, allowing them to experiment with AI-assisted composition and create novel musical scores [20]. The integration of AI tools as teacher assistants also shows promise in enhancing the overall student learning experience, providing supplementary support and potentially tailored guidance [21].​  

Beyond education, foundation models hold potential for application in music therapy. By enabling creative expression and interaction with music in personalized ways, these technologies could assist patients in expressing themselves and improving their emotional well-being. However, specific methods leveraging advanced foundation models for therapeutic outcomes remain an area requiring further development and rigorous investigation.  

The application of foundation models in both music education and therapy also introduces important challenges and ethical considerations. Key concerns include the necessity for human oversight to ensure appropriate use and interpretation of AI-generated content or analysis, particularly in therapeutic contexts where emotional vulnerability is high. Additionally, the potential for bias embedded within AI models, stemming from the data they are trained on, poses a risk that could lead to inequitable outcomes or reinforce existing biases in musical styles or therapeutic approaches. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the responsible and effective integration of foundation models into these sensitive domains.  

# 8. Datasets and Evaluation  

The development and training of effective foundation models for music generation critically depend on the availability and characteristics of large-scale, high-quality datasets, as well as robust evaluation methodologies [5,7,17,19,25]. Diverse and extensive datasets are essential to capture the complexity, styles, and modalities inherent in music, mitigating biases and enabling models to generalize across various musical tasks [9,10]. Commonly used datasets for training music foundation models can be broadly categorized by their content modality, including pure lyrics, pure melodies, and challenging paired lyric-melody data. Datasets like MAESTRO and Lakh MIDI Dataset provide significant corpora of symbolic music data (MIDI), suitable for tasks ranging from piano performance generation to multi-track music, while NSynth offers note-level audio data [11]. Large lyric datasets are often compiled from web sources [3,4,17]. Creating high-quality paired datasets, such as the SongCompose-PT paired dataset, is particularly complex, requiring sophisticated processes for accurate alignment of lyrics and melodies, often involving multiple steps from audio processing to symbolic representation and word-level synchronization using techniques like Dynamic Time Warping [3,4,17]. The varying sizes, formats (symbolic vs. audio), and content types of these datasets present distinct advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific music generation task, highlighting the challenge of data scarcity for certain modalities or fine-grained alignment requirements.  

The evaluation of music foundation models necessitates a combination of objective and subjective metrics to capture both technical correctness and artistic quality [9]. Objective metrics provide quantitative assessments of specific musical features, such as pitch and duration distribution similarity (e.g., PD, DD, MD, sometimes framed within systems like SongMASS) for melodies, or semantic and structural coherence (e.g., ROUGE-2, BERT scores, CoSENT) for lyrics [3,4,17]. These metrics offer valuable insights into specific aspects of the generated output and facilitate comparisons against real data or reference samples [3]. However, objective metrics alone are insufficient as they often fail to capture the nuanced, subjective aspects of musicality, creativity, and emotional impact that are central to human perception of music [3,4,9,17]. Consequently, subjective evaluations, involving human listeners ranging from amateurs to experts, are crucial. Participants typically rate generated music on criteria such as harmony, melody-lyric compatibility, fluency, coherence, originality, and overall quality using scales [3,4,10,17].​  

Despite the availability of both objective and subjective evaluation methods, current evaluation frameworks face significant limitations [3,5,17,19,25]. Objective metrics, while quantifiable, often do not strongly correlate with human judgments of musical quality or artistic merit. Subjective evaluations, while essential, can be costly, time-consuming, and susceptible to inter-rater variability and biases. There is a critical need for improved evaluation frameworks that can more effectively bridge the gap between objective measures and subjective human preferences, potentially through the development of more perceptually aligned metrics or sophisticated human-in-the-loop evaluation designs [19,25]. Challenges also persist in evaluating complex, long-form, or multimodal music generation tasks comprehensively. Addressing these limitations and the underlying issue of data scarcity for diverse and high-quality training corpora is vital for advancing the capabilities and applicability of foundation models in music creation.​  

# 8.1 Datasets for Music Foundation Models  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Dataset Type</td><td>Description</td><td>Common Representation</td><td>Key Sources / Examples</td></tr><tr><td>Pure Lyrics</td><td>Text corpora of song lyrics</td><td>Text</td><td>Kaggle, Music Lyric Chatbot, Web Scraping</td></tr><tr><td>Pure Melody</td><td>Collections of melodic sequences</td><td>Symbolic (MIDI)</td><td>Lakh MIDI Dataset, MAESTRO,Web Scraping</td></tr><tr><td>Pure Audio</td><td>Raw audio recordings of music or notes</td><td>Audio</td><td>NSynth</td></tr><tr><td>Paired Lyric-Melody</td><td>Lyrics aligned with corresponding melodies</td><td>Symbolic (+Text)</td><td>SongCompose-PT (LMD-full, Reddit, OpenCpop, M4Singer)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The efficacy and generalization capabilities of music foundation models are intrinsically linked to the characteristics, diversity, and quality of the datasets used for their training [19,25]. Diverse and high-quality data are crucial for training robust models that can generate music across various styles, genres, and modalities, mitigating issues such as bias towards specific musical styles observed with datasets skewed towards particular domains, like the generic Western music results from certain large melody datasets [10]. Datasets for music foundation models typically encompass different modalities, including pure lyrics, pure melodies (often represented as symbolic MIDI data), and paired lyric-melody data.  

Pure lyric datasets are primarily compiled from extensive online sources. For instance, the SongCompose-PT dataset incorporates a pure lyrics component derived from a Kaggle dataset comprising 150,000 songs annotated with Spotify Valence tags and the Music Lyric Chatbot dataset containing 140,000 Chinese song lyrics, totaling approximately 283,000 entries [3,4,17]. These datasets are typically collected through web scraping or obtained from existing public repositories.  

Pure melody datasets frequently utilize MIDI files due to their structured, symbolic representation of musical information. Compilation methods involve collecting large corpora of MIDI data, such as the Lakh MIDI Dataset containing around 176,000 files or the MAESTRO dataset with approximately 200 hours of piano performances [11]. Another source, NSynth, provides about 300,000 note audio data points [11]. For datasets used in models like SongComposer, MIDI files are parsed using libraries such as pretty_midi to extract specific tracks, particularly "melody" or "vocal" tracks [3,17]. This extraction process yields a symbolic representation, often structured as triplets of melody attributes: {note pitch, note duration, rest duration} [3,4]. Sources for these MIDI files include the LMD-matched dataset (contributing around 45,000 entries) and data obtained via web scraping (initially 80,000 entries, filtered to about 20,000 high-quality samples) [3,17]. Furthermore, datasets can be generated by converting audio formats like MP3 to MIDI using tools such as Spotify's Basic Pitch [9]. Large collections of melodies and rhythms, as used by Magenta Studio tools, can result in generic outputs, highlighting the influence of dataset scope and specificity on model performance [10].  

Creating high-quality paired lyric-melody datasets presents significant challenges, primarily related to the accurate alignment of lyrical content with corresponding musical events, especially at fine-grained levels like word boundaries [17]. Such datasets are constructed by integrating lyrics with their corresponding melodies or vocal tracks. The SongCompose-PT paired dataset, for instance, is a complex compilation drawn from multiple sources including the LMD-full dataset (7,998 songs), a Reddit dataset (4,199 songs), the OpenCpop dataset (100 Chinese songs), the M4Singer dataset (700 high-quality Chinese songs), and an additional 4,000 classic Chinese songs collected from the web [3,17].

The process for aligning lyrics and melodies is elaborate, often involving multiple sophisticated steps [3,4,17]. This includes initial data collection (MP3 audio and timestamped lyrics), lyric cleaning (potentially using large language models like GPT4), segmenting audio and lyrics into manageable pairs (e.g., 10-second segments), separating vocals from instrumental tracks using source separation tools (e.g., UVR4), transcribing vocals into symbolic representations (e.g., using tools like FL Studio), converting lyrics into phoneme sequences (e.g., using Pypinyin), annotating word boundaries (e.g., using Montreal Forced Aligner), and finally, performing word-level alignment between the transcribed vocal melody and the lyrical phoneme sequences. A common approach for alignment is Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) [3,4,17]. This rigorous process results in aligned datasets, such as the SongCompose-PT paired data which comprises approximately 15,000 entries, split between Chinese (around 5,000) and English (around 10,000) [3,4,17]. The complexity of this process underscores the challenges in creating high-quality, accurately aligned multimodal music datasets essential for training sophisticated foundation models capable of generating coherent and synchronized lyrics and melodies.​  

# 8.2 Evaluation Metrics for Music Generation  

Evaluating the quality and musicality of AI-generated music is a crucial step in the development and refinement of foundation models for music creation [9].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Metric Type</td><td>Description</td><td>Examples / Criteria</td><td>Advantages</td><td>Limitations</td></tr><tr><td>Objective</td><td>Quantitative measures of specific musical features</td><td>Pitch/Duration Distribution (PD, DD), Melodic Distance (MD), ROUGE, BERT, CoSENT</td><td>Quantifiable, repeatable,aids technical tuning</td><td>May not correlate with human perception, misses nuance</td></tr><tr><td>Subjective</td><td>Human judgment based on perception</td><td>Harmony, Coherence, Originality, Quality, Melody- Lyric Compatibility</td><td>Captures human artistic/aestheti c perception</td><td>Costly, time- consuming, inter-rater variability</td></tr><tr><td>Integrated/HIT L</td><td>Combines quantitative analysis with human feedback (Ideal future state)</td><td>Perceptually aligned metrics, human-in-the- loop designs</td><td>Potential to bridge objective/subjec tive gap</td><td>Requires sophisticated design,ongoing research</td></tr></table></body></html>  

This evaluation typically involves a combination of objective and subjective methods to assess different facets of the generated output.  

Objective evaluation metrics provide quantitative measures of specific musical attributes, often comparing the generated output to a reference dataset or employing computational analysis of the musical structure. Commonly used objective metrics for melody generation include Pitch Distribution Similarity (PD), Duration Distribution Similarity (DD), and Melodic Distance (MD) [3,4,17]. These metrics, sometimes grouped under frameworks like SongMASS [3,4], are relevant for assessing how well the generated melody adheres to expected patterns in pitch and duration frequencies, or how structurally similar it is to other melodies. For evaluating generated lyrics, objective measures such as ROUGE-2 and BERT scores are employed to assess content overlap and semantic similarity, while models like CoSENT are used to specifically evaluate sentence-level alignment and semantic coherence [3,4,17].  

Complementing objective measures, subjective evaluation methods rely on human perception and judgment to assess aspects that are difficult to quantify computationally, such as artistic value, musicality, and emotional impact [9]. Subjective assessments typically involve human participants, who may range from amateur musicians to expert practitioners [10], rating the generated music on various criteria, often using a Likert scale (e.g., 1 to 5) [3,4,17]. Key subjective evaluation criteria include harmony, melody-lyric compatibility, fluency, coherence, originality, and overall quality [3,17]. For specific tasks like song continuation or text-to-song generation, subjective evaluations also consider consistency with prompts or relevance to text input [3,4]. Models like YuE have been evaluated extensively through subjective assessments, demonstrating performance comparable to or surpassing proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility [12].​  

While objective metrics offer valuable insights into structural properties, they inherently cannot fully capture the multifaceted nature of musical quality and artistic expression, which are subject to human interpretation [9]. The correlation between objective scores and subjective human preferences is not always direct or absolute. Relying solely on objective measures presents limitations, as a generated piece might score well on statistical similarities but lack perceived musicality, emotional depth, or creativity. Conversely, a novel and highly artistic piece might deviate from statistical norms but be subjectively preferred. This highlights the necessity of incorporating subjective evaluation, which directly gauges the human experience and artistic merit of the generated music [3,4,17].​  

Therefore, best practices for evaluating music generation models involve employing a comprehensive approach that integrates both objective and subjective evaluations [3,4,17]. Objective metrics provide a baseline for technical correctness and structural properties, aiding in model development and comparison across specific features. Subjective evaluations, particularly involving human listeners, are essential for assessing the overall musical quality, aesthetic appeal, and taskspecific performance (e.g., melody-lyric compatibility) [3,17]. Incorporating human-in-the-loop evaluation methods, where human feedback directly informs model training or refinement, represents a crucial approach to enhancing models' ability to generate music that is not only structurally sound but also artistically compelling and aligned with human preferences [19,25].​  

# 9. Ethical Considerations  

The development and application of foundation models for music necessitate a thorough examination of their ethical implications, which span a wide range of concerns [5,7,8,9,19,21,24,27,28].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Issue</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Training Data Use</td><td>Using copyrighted music datasets without permission/compensation</td></tr><tr><td>Infringement Risk</td><td>Al-generated output potentially infringing on training data copyrights</td></tr><tr><td>Authorship&Ownership</td><td>Unclear legal status of who owns Al- generated music</td></tr><tr><td>Detection Challenges</td><td>Difficulty in tracing lineage and identifying infringement in Al outputs</td></tr><tr><td>Consent & Compensation</td><td>Need for frameworks to compensate artists whose work is used for training</td></tr></table></body></html>  

A primary area of concern involves copyright and intellectual property. The extensive datasets used to train AI music models frequently include copyrighted material, raising significant ethical and legal challenges regarding their use without explicit permission or compensation [9,21]. This leads to a substantial risk of intellectual property infringement during the training phase [9]. Furthermore, the music generated by these models presents complex questions about authorship, ownership, and potential infringement on the copyrights of the training data, contributing to an unclear legal status and the potential for disputes [8,19,21,27]. Detecting and preventing such infringement is challenging due to the transformative nature of AI generation, requiring careful consideration of mechanisms for consent and compensation [9,21].​  

Beyond intellectual property, the rise of music foundation models significantly impacts human musicians and the broader music industry [9,18,19,21,24,27]. There are concerns regarding the potential displacement of human musicians and a fundamental alteration in music creation and consumption [21]. AI-generated music can threaten traditional income streams, such as advertising jingles, and challenge human musicians seeking recognition in an increasingly automated environment [9,18]. Debate persists about AI's capacity for emotional expression and its inherent differences from human artistry, alongside ethical concerns about the unauthorized use of artificial voices mimicking artists [8,19,24]. Navigating this disruption requires developing new business models and revenue streams, robust contract negotiation, and strengthened protection of artists' rights [7,21].  

Another critical ethical dimension is the potential for bias and lack of representation in AI music generation models [5,7]. AI tools risk replicating and amplifying societal biases present in their training data, potentially perpetuating stereotypes and excluding underrepresented musical styles or cultural expressions [21]. Addressing this requires an awareness of these issues, a critical evaluation of AI outputs, and the development of robust mitigation strategies [21]. Ensuring fairness and inclusivity necessitates a focus on interpretability and transparency in music foundation models [5,7], which is essential for diagnosing bias sources that may be linked to training data imbalances.​  

Given these complex challenges, there is a strong imperative for further research to clarify and address multifaceted ethical issues [7]. This includes developing guidelines and best practices for the ethical and responsible development and use of music foundation models, with an emphasis on interpretability, transparency, human responsibility, and robust legal frameworks for copyright and ownership [5].​  

# 9.1 Copyright and Intellectual Property  

The advent of foundation models for music has introduced complex legal issues, particularly concerning copyright and intellectual property [9]. A primary concern revolves around the extensive music datasets utilized for training these AI models, which often contain copyrighted material. The ethical and legal challenges associated with employing such data without explicit permission or compensation are significant [9,21]. There is a substantial risk that AI models may be trained on copyrighted works without proper authorization, potentially leading to intellectual property infringement [9].  

Furthermore, the music generated by these AI models raises questions about potential infringement on the copyrights of the training data [19,21]. This issue has manifested in real-world legal disputes, such as the case where Universal Music Group reportedly sued Anthropic over alleged copyright infringement related to their AI model's training data [19]. The legal status of AI-generated music remains largely unclear, contributing to uncertainties regarding ownership and the potential for future disputes [8].​  

Detecting and preventing copyright infringement by AI-generated music presents significant challenges [9]. The transformative nature of AI generation, coupled with the vast scale of potential outputs and the complexity of tracing lineage to specific training data, makes traditional methods of infringement detection difficult. Addressing these challenges necessitates considering mechanisms for consent and compensation for artists whose creative works are integral to the training process of these models [21]. Given these complexities and unresolved issues, further research is strongly advised to focus on clarifying and addressing the multifaceted copyright issues in AI music generation [7].​  

# 9.2 Impact on Musicians and the Music Industry

<html><body><table><tr><td>Artificial Voices</td><td>Unauthorized use of Al models mimicking artists'voices</td></tr><tr><td>Need for Adaptation</td><td>Requirement for new business models, contracts,and rights protection</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Foundation models for music present significant potential for disruption within the music industry [9,21]. This disruption extends to the potential displacement of human musicians as well as a fundamental alteration in how music is created and consumed [21]. The proliferation of AI-generated music poses a direct threat to the livelihoods of musicians by impacting traditional income streams such as the creation of advertising jingles [18]. Furthermore, the increasing volume of AIgenerated content presents challenges for human musicians seeking recognition in an evolving marketplace [9].  

A central point of discussion involves the inherent nature of AI-generated music compared to human creation. Debate exists regarding the capacity for emotional expression in AI music and its fundamental differences from human artistic processes [19]. While AI can produce technically sophisticated compositions, these may potentially lack the emotional nuances and unique human touch, which could impact overall quality and the depth of emotional connection with listeners [8]. Ethical considerations are also paramount, including concerns surrounding the use of artificially generated voices that imitate actual artists without explicit consent [24].  

Navigating this transformative period necessitates a proactive approach focused on human responsibility within the evolving AI landscape [7]. A critical requirement is the development of new business models and revenue streams capable of supporting and integrating both human-created and AI-generated music [21]. This adaptation process must include robust contract negotiation frameworks and strengthened mechanisms for protecting artists' rights in the face of rapidly advancing AI technologies [21].​  

# 9.3 Bias and Representation  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Issue</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Bias Amplification</td><td>Al models replicating/amplifying biases present in training data</td></tr><tr><td>Stereotyping</td><td>Perpetuating genre, cultural, or stylistic stereotypes</td></tr><tr><td>Exclusion</td><td>Underrepresenting or excluding specific musical styles,cultures,or artists</td></tr><tr><td>Awareness Needed</td><td>Critical evaluation of Al outputs to identify biases</td></tr><tr><td>Mitigation Strategies</td><td>Developing techniques to counter bias in training and generation</td></tr><tr><td>Transparency& Interpretability</td><td>Essential for diagnosing bias sources (e.g., data imbalances)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

A critical concern in the application of foundation models for music generation is the potential for bias and its implications for representation and inclusivity. AI tools, including those used in creative domains such as music, inherently risk replicating and amplifying existing societal biases present in their training data [21]. This phenomenon can lead to the perpetuation of stereotypes within AI-generated musical content and potentially exclude certain musical styles, cultural expressions, or underrepresented artist contributions if they are not adequately represented in the training datasets.  

Addressing these biases requires a multifaceted approach. Firstly, there is a clear need for awareness and critical evaluation when deploying and interpreting the output of AI music generation models [21]. Researchers and practitioners must actively identify potential biases in the models and the data they were trained on. Furthermore, mitigation strategies are essential to counter the replication of harmful biases in AI-generated content [21].​  

Ensuring fairness and inclusivity in AI music generation necessitates focusing future research on interpretability and transparency issues [7]. Greater interpretability allows researchers to understand whya model produces a particular output, helping to diagnose the source of bias, potentially linked to imbalances or specific characteristics within the training data. Transparency in the model architecture and training process further facilitates this analysis. While the provided digests do not explicitly detail the necessity of diverse training datasets, the discussion of mitigating bias and ensuring fair outputs inherently points to the critical importance of training models on datasets that are representative of a wide array of musical genres, cultures, historical periods, and production styles to avoid perpetuating stylistic or cultural exclusion. Developing models that are explicitly designed with fairness and inclusivity objectives in mind remains a significant area for future work.  

# 10. Challenges and Future Directions  

The advancement of music foundation models, while demonstrating significant potential, is accompanied by notable challenges that necessitate focused research and development. Current limitations span technical, data, ethical, and evaluative dimensions. Technically, a core challenge lies in the computational resources required, particularly for complex, interactive, and real-time music generation and processing [27]. There are inherent trade-offs between model size, performance, and computational cost, demanding substantial resources for training and inference, which poses challenges for broader adoption and accessibility [19,27]. Data scarcity and the dependence on large, diverse datasets remain significant hurdles, impacting model generalization capabilities and the ability to support a wide range of musical styles [9]. Furthermore, achieving fine-grained controllability over musical parameters and structure continues to be a challenge, as current AI results may not always match the artistic control possible with earlier algorithmic methods [22,23]. Challenges also persist in generating music with nuanced emotional expression [11], maintaining stylistic consistency in longer pieces [18], and accurately representing complex musical elements like timbre and expression beyond simple sequences [10]. Interpretability and transparency of these complex models also represent key challenges [1,5,7,19]. The subjective nature of musical evaluation also highlights the critical need for improved, objective, and perhaps human-centric evaluation metrics [5,19,25].  

Addressing these challenges paves the way for promising future research directions aimed at pushing the boundaries of music AI [19,26,27]. A primary focus is on developing more powerful and versatile models capable of greater musical expression and innovation, potentially moving towards Music x AGI [9,16]. This includes improving core capabilities like MIDI generation and state-of-the-art transcription [10], and exploring advanced deep learning methods for melody extraction and representation [18]. Techniques to enhance generation speed and achieve comprehensive multi-style support are actively being explored [2,11]. Furthermore, incorporating human feedback and musical knowledge into model training and interaction design is crucial for aligning AI outputs with artistic intent and human perception [5,10,14].​  

A significant future direction involves the exploration and development of multi-modal foundation models [1,5]. This involves integrating AI capabilities across different modalities, such as combining audio generation with visual elements or generating music from diverse inputs like text, images, and video [2,19,31]. This trend points towards a future where AI acts increasingly as a creative partner, augmenting human creativity through collaborative tools and interfaces [2,19,28]. Establishing robust ethical frameworks, ensuring transparency, human responsibility, addressing copyright issues, and protecting data privacy are paramount for the responsible development and deployment of these technologies [7,11,21]. Beyond creation, future research may unlock AI's potential in music analysis, education, and applications within immersive environments like VR/AR, utilizing capabilities such as transcription and melody extraction as foundational tools [2,10,18,20,21]. The path forward involves tackling these multifaceted challenges while strategically pursuing these promising research avenues to fully realize the potential of AI in transforming music creation, understanding, and engagement.​  

# 10.1 Addressing Technical Challenges  

Developing and deploying foundation models for music generation involves navigating significant technical challenges. A primary concern revolves around the inherent trade-offs among model size, performance, and computational cost [19]. Larger, more complex models often achieve superior generation quality and diversity, but they demand substantial computational resources for both training and inference, leading to increased costs and slower processing times.​  

Strategies for mitigating the computational burden are crucial for the wider adoption of these models. For handling largescale datasets necessary for training comprehensive foundation models, leveraging cloud computing provides scalable AI solutions that can manage vast data volumes without compromising performance [27]. For deployment, particularly in userfacing applications like browsers or mobile apps, the feasibility of running AI composers directly necessitates streamlined models and efficient architectures. This might involve executing the core AI composer tools seamlessly on a back-end server, accessible via a web UI, to offload intensive computation from client devices [20].  

Another significant challenge lies in the generalization capabilities of models, specifically their ability to adapt to and generate music in new or diverse styles and genres. The quality and diversity of generated music are intrinsically linked to the training data; consequently, a limited dataset size or variety can severely restrict the range of musical ideas and styles the model can learn and reproduce, hindering generalization and multi-style support [9]. Improving robustness and adaptability requires addressing this data dependency, potentially through more diverse data collection or techniques that enable better style disentanglement or few-shot learning.  

Current models also face limitations concerning generation speed and inherent difficulties in supporting a broad spectrum of musical styles [11]. Accelerating the generation process is vital for real-time or interactive music creation applications. While specific detailed methods for widespread acceleration and general multi-style support are areas of ongoing research [11], addressing underlying complexities in music signals and long-context dependencies is key to improving overall generation efficiency and quality. Models like YuE tackle challenges such as long context and complex music signals in music generation [6]. Techniques such as track-decoupled next-token prediction and structural progressive conditioning have been employed to overcome dense mixture signals and achieve better long-context lyrical alignment, which is crucial for generating coherent and expressive long-form music [12].​  

Furthermore, enhancing the emotional expression and overall musical performance of generated content remains a significant technical goal [11]. Improving the alignment between lyrical content and generated melodies, as demonstrated by models like SongComposer which utilize text-based melody representation and directly model this alignment, contributes significantly to the perceived quality and expressiveness of vocal music [4]. However, a noted limitation of current AI and machine learning approaches compared to previous algorithmic methods is a relative lack of direct controllability [22]. Developing techniques that provide finer-grained control over musical parameters, structure, and expressive nuances is essential for improving the artistic utility and performance quality of AI-generated music.​
