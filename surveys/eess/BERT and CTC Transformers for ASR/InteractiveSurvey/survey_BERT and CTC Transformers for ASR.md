# 2 Introduction
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has seen significant advancements in recent years, driven by the integration of deep learning techniques and the availability of large-scale datasets [1]. The field has evolved from traditional Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) approaches to more sophisticated models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformers. These advancements have significantly improved the accuracy and robustness of ASR systems, making them more applicable in real-world scenarios such as virtual assistants, customer service, and real-time translation [2]. However, the challenges of handling diverse acoustic conditions, low-resource languages, and complex linguistic structures remain. The integration of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques has emerged as a promising direction to address these challenges, paving the way for more advanced and adaptable ASR systems [3].

This survey paper focuses on the integration of BERT and CTC Transformers in ASR, exploring how these state-of-the-art models can be leveraged to enhance the performance and efficiency of ASR systems [4]. The paper delves into the recent developments in early exiting mechanisms, knowledge distillation, and the use of large language models for rescoring and representation transfer. Additionally, it examines the integration of ASR features in Conformer-based systems and the application of non-autoregressive models for joint ASR and spoken language understanding (SLU) [5]. The survey also covers the ethical and fairness considerations in ASR, including gender bias and responsible AI practices in multimodal systems.

The paper begins by discussing the integration of BERT and CTC in ASR, highlighting the early exiting mechanisms and knowledge distillation techniques that enhance computational efficiency and model accuracy. It then explores the use of large language models for rescoring and the transfer of representations from LLMs to ASR systems, emphasizing the role of auxiliary attention decoders and forced alignment [6]. The integration of ASR features in Conformer-based systems is also examined, showcasing how these features improve the alignment of acoustic and linguistic information. The paper further delves into non-autoregressive models for joint ASR and SLU, discussing their efficiency and performance in real-time applications [4].

Next, the survey reviews the advancements in multimodal approaches, including the use of cascaded cross-modal transformers for speech classification and the development of multimodal corpora and multitasking models [7]. It also explores the application of multimodal diffusion models for generating UTI data and the end-to-end multimodal models such as Wave BERT for spoken language understanding [8]. The ethical and fairness considerations in ASR are addressed, with a focus on gender bias and responsible AI practices [2]. The paper concludes with a discussion on the application of ASR in diverse systems, including spoken content retrieval, scene graph grounding, and audio-related query handling in chatbot systems [9].

The contributions of this survey paper are multifaceted. It provides a comprehensive overview of the latest research and developments in integrating BERT and CTC Transformers for ASR, offering insights into the technical advancements and practical applications [10]. The paper also highlights the challenges and future directions in the field, making it a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in the intersection of ASR, deep learning, and natural language processing. By synthesizing the current state of the art and identifying areas for further research, this survey aims to facilitate the development of more robust, efficient, and equitable ASR systems.

# 3 Integration of BERT and CTC in ASR

## 3.1 Early Exiting and Knowledge Distillation

### 3.1.1 HuBERT Early Exiting
In the realm of automatic speech recognition (ASR), the introduction of early exiting mechanisms in deep learning models has emerged as a promising approach to enhance computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. HuBERT Early Exiting (HuBERT-EE) is a novel method that integrates early exit branches into the HuBERT (Hidden Unit BERT) model, a state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) framework. By strategically placing these branches at intermediate layers, HuBERT-EE enables the model to terminate the inference process early when the intermediate prediction is sufficiently confident, thereby reducing the overall computational load [11].

The core idea behind HuBERT-EE is to leverage the intermediate representations generated by the self-attention layers of HuBERT to make early predictions. Each early exit branch consists of a lightweight self-attention mechanism that evaluates the confidence of the current intermediate output [11]. If the confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, the model outputs the intermediate prediction as the final result, bypassing the remaining layers. This dynamic early exit strategy is particularly advantageous in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile devices and IoT applications, where reducing latency and energy consumption is critical.

Compared to traditional early exit methods in ASR, which often rely on intermediate CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) outputs, HuBERT-EE offers a more flexible and context-aware approach. The self-attention-based early exit branches in HuBERT-EE can adapt to the complexity of the input speech, allowing the model to make more informed decisions about when to exit [11]. This adaptability not only accelerates inference but also maintains high accuracy, making HuBERT-EE a compelling solution for real-time ASR applications.

### 3.1.2 Knowledge Distillation with Auxiliary Attention Decoder
Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful technique to transfer the rich linguistic knowledge captured by large pre-trained language models (PLMs) to end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) systems [12]. In the context of E2E-ASR, KD typically involves training a smaller, more efficient ASR model (the student) to mimic the behavior of a larger, more complex PLM (the teacher). The auxiliary attention decoder (AAD) is a novel component designed to enhance this knowledge transfer process by providing an additional mechanism for the student model to learn from the teacher. Unlike traditional KD approaches that focus solely on the final output logits, the AAD introduces an intermediate layer that captures the attention patterns and hidden state representations of the teacher model, thereby enriching the student's understanding of the input speech.

The AAD operates by augmenting the standard ASR architecture with an additional decoder that is specifically trained to match the attention mechanisms and hidden states of the teacher model. This auxiliary decoder is designed to work in parallel with the primary ASR decoder, allowing the student model to benefit from both the direct supervision of the ground-truth labels and the indirect supervision provided by the teacher's attention and hidden states. By doing so, the AAD helps the student model to better capture the contextual and syntactic information that is crucial for accurate speech recognition. This dual-supervision approach not only improves the overall performance of the ASR system but also enhances its robustness to variations in the input speech, such as noise and speaker variability.

Experimental evaluations have shown that the incorporation of an AAD in the KD framework leads to significant improvements in ASR performance, particularly in challenging scenarios where the input speech is noisy or the vocabulary is large. The AAD's ability to distill the teacher's attention and hidden state representations into the student model helps to bridge the gap between the linguistic capabilities of the PLM and the acoustic capabilities of the ASR system. This synergy between the acoustic and linguistic components of the model results in a more balanced and effective ASR system, capable of producing more accurate and contextually appropriate transcriptions [5]. Furthermore, the AAD approach is flexible and can be adapted to various ASR architectures, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the performance of E2E-ASR systems across different domains and languages.

### 3.1.3 Forced Alignment for Token-Level Predictions
Forced alignment plays a pivotal role in aligning token-level predictions from a language model (LM) with the frame-level predictions of a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based ASR model [13]. This technique leverages the CTC forward-backward algorithm or the Viterbi algorithm to compute the most probable alignment between the predicted frames and the ground truth tokens. By doing so, it bridges the gap between the token-level predictions of the LM and the frame-level outputs of the CTC model, enabling effective knowledge distillation from the LM to the ASR model.

The process begins by using the CTC model to generate a sequence of frame-level predictions, which are then aligned with the token-level predictions from the LM using the Viterbi path. This alignment ensures that each frame is associated with a specific token, even though the CTC model does not explicitly model the temporal dependencies between frames. The aligned token-level predictions from the LM are then used as soft targets for the CTC model during training. This approach allows the CTC model to benefit from the rich contextual information provided by the LM, thereby improving its ability to handle linguistic complexities and reduce errors in the final ASR output [13].

In practice, the integration of forced alignment with CTC-based ASR models has been shown to enhance the model's performance, especially in scenarios where the ASR model struggles with ambiguous or low-confidence predictions. By incorporating the LM's token-level predictions, the ASR model can make more informed decisions, leading to more accurate and coherent transcriptions. This method not only improves the overall accuracy of the ASR system but also enhances its robustness in handling challenging acoustic conditions and diverse linguistic contexts [5].

## 3.2 Model Enhancements and Rescoring

### 3.2.1 Large Language Models for Rescoring
Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for enhancing the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems through rescoring techniques. In this approach, the ASR system generates a set of n-best hypotheses, which are then re-scored using an LLM to select the most probable transcription. This method leverages the rich linguistic knowledge and context-aware capabilities of LLMs, which are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data, to refine the ASR output [14]. By integrating these models, the rescoring process can correct errors and improve the overall accuracy of the ASR system, particularly in scenarios with limited training data or complex linguistic structures.

The effectiveness of LLMs in rescoring is attributed to their ability to model long-range dependencies and capture nuanced semantic and syntactic information. For instance, BERT and its variants, such as RoBERTa and DistillBERT, have been widely used in this context due to their bidirectional architecture, which allows them to consider both past and future context. This bidirectional context is particularly beneficial for CTC-based ASR models, which typically use a bidirectional encoder. The integration of LLMs can be achieved through various methods, including n-best rescoring, where the LLM re-scores the hypotheses generated by the ASR model, and knowledge distillation, where the LLM's representations are used to guide the training of the ASR model. These techniques have been shown to improve the robustness and accuracy of ASR systems, especially in handling out-of-vocabulary words and rare linguistic phenomena [14].

Despite the advantages, incorporating LLMs into ASR systems also presents challenges, such as increased computational complexity and the need for careful fine-tuning to bridge the gap between the speech and text modalities [12]. To address these issues, recent research has explored efficient methods for integrating LLMs, such as using smaller, distilled versions of LLMs and optimizing the rescoring process to maintain real-time performance. Additionally, the use of auxiliary tasks and iterative refinement schemes has been proposed to enhance the transfer of linguistic knowledge from LLMs to ASR models [14]. These advancements have paved the way for more effective and efficient ASR systems, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in improving speech recognition accuracy and robustness [12].

### 3.2.2 Transfer of Representations from LLMs
The transfer of representations from large language models (LLMs) to automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the performance of speech-to-text transcription [12]. LLMs, such as BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2, are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to capture intricate linguistic patterns and contextual information [6]. By leveraging these pre-trained models, ASR systems can benefit from the rich semantic and syntactic representations learned by LLMs, thereby improving their ability to handle challenging speech inputs and reduce error rates [14].

One common method for transferring representations from LLMs to ASR systems involves using the pre-trained models to generate contextualized embeddings for the text hypotheses produced by the ASR model [12]. These embeddings are then used to refine the ASR model's predictions, either through knowledge distillation or by serving as additional input features. For instance, in knowledge distillation, the ASR model is trained to match the output distributions of the LLM, effectively learning to mimic the LLM's linguistic expertise [14]. This approach has been shown to be particularly effective when using bidirectional LLMs like BERT, which can provide more comprehensive context compared to unidirectional models like GPT-2.

Another approach is to incorporate LLM representations directly into the ASR model's architecture, such as by concatenating the LLM-generated embeddings with the acoustic features at various layers of the ASR model. This integration allows the ASR model to leverage the LLM's deep understanding of language structure, potentially leading to more accurate and contextually aware transcriptions [8]. Additionally, recent studies have explored the use of intermediate layers of LLMs, which capture different levels of linguistic abstraction, to further enhance the ASR model's performance. These methods highlight the potential of LLMs to bridge the gap between speech and text, ultimately contributing to more robust and accurate ASR systems [12].

### 3.2.3 Integration of ASR Features in Conformer-Based Systems
The integration of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) features in Conformer-based systems represents a significant advancement in enhancing the robustness and accuracy of end-to-end ASR models. Conformer architectures, which combine the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers, have been shown to excel in capturing both local and global dependencies in speech signals. By integrating ASR features such as time-aligned phonemes, position-in-word information, and word boundaries, these models can better align acoustic and linguistic information, leading to improved performance in tasks such as diarization and speech-to-text transcription [5]. The inclusion of these features helps the model to more accurately capture the temporal dynamics of speech, which is crucial for disambiguating overlapping speakers and recognizing speech in noisy environments.

One of the key approaches to integrating ASR features in Conformer-based systems involves concatenating these features with the acoustic features at the input layer of the model [1]. This method ensures that the model has access to both the raw acoustic data and the higher-level linguistic information during the initial stages of processing. Another approach is to provide ASR features as context in the attention mechanisms of the Conformer encoder. This contextualized self-attention allows the model to dynamically weigh the importance of different ASR features based on the current context, thereby improving its ability to handle complex linguistic structures and variations in speech patterns. Additionally, multi-task learning frameworks have been explored, where the model is trained to jointly optimize for ASR and other related tasks such as speaker diarization or language identification, further enhancing its overall performance.

The effectiveness of integrating ASR features in Conformer-based systems has been validated through extensive experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets. These studies have shown that the inclusion of ASR features can lead to significant improvements in word error rates (WER) and diarization error rates (DER), particularly in challenging scenarios involving multiple speakers or noisy environments [15]. Moreover, the use of pre-trained BERT models fine-tuned for specific ASR tasks has been shown to further enhance the model's linguistic capabilities, allowing it to better understand and transcribe speech [14]. Overall, the integration of ASR features in Conformer-based systems represents a promising direction for advancing the state-of-the-art in end-to-end ASR and related speech processing tasks [1].

## 3.3 Comprehensive Reviews and Evaluations

### 3.3.1 Systematic Review of BERT and CTC in ASR
The integration of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been a focal point of recent research, driven by the need to enhance the robustness and accuracy of ASR systems [11]. BERT, with its bidirectional context understanding, offers a powerful tool for language modeling, which can be leveraged to refine the outputs of CTC-based models [14]. CTC, on the other hand, provides a non-autoregressive framework that simplifies the alignment between acoustic features and text, making it computationally efficient. However, the direct application of BERT in CTC-based ASR systems is not straightforward due to the mismatch in output vocabularies and the sequential nature of speech data [13].

To address these challenges, several approaches have been proposed. One notable method is the BERT-CTC-Transducer (BECTRA), which extends the BERT-CTC framework by incorporating a transducer-based decoder [14]. This decoder is trained using a vocabulary tailored to the ASR task, thereby mitigating the vocabulary mismatch issue. The transducer model allows for more flexible and accurate sequence prediction, especially in scenarios where the BERT vocabulary is too large or domain-mismatched. Additionally, the iterative refinement process used in BERT-CTC, where low-confidence tokens are iteratively corrected using a masked language model, can be effectively integrated into the transducer framework to further enhance ASR performance [16].

Despite these advancements, the performance of BERT-CTC and its variants is still influenced by factors such as the scale and quality of training data, the alignment between the BERT and ASR vocabularies, and the effectiveness of the refinement algorithms [16]. Future research in this area could focus on optimizing the integration of BERT and CTC, exploring more efficient methods for vocabulary alignment, and developing adaptive refinement strategies that can handle a wider range of speech inputs and conditions [16]. The potential for cross-lingual transfer and the application of BERT-CTC in low-resource languages also present promising avenues for further exploration.

### 3.3.2 BERT-CTC and BECTRA Models
The BERT-CTC and BECTRA models represent significant advancements in the integration of large pre-trained language models with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken language understanding (SLU) [14]. BERT-CTC leverages the bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) to enhance the linguistic context of CTC-based ASR systems [10]. By incorporating BERT, BERT-CTC can better handle the dependencies between output tokens, which are typically ignored in vanilla CTC models [13]. This is achieved through a fine-tuning process where BERT's token-level predictions are aligned with the frame-level predictions of the CTC model using the Viterbi algorithm, thus improving the overall accuracy and robustness of the ASR system [13].

Building upon BERT-CTC, the BERT-CTC-Transducer (BECTRA) model further refines the integration of BERT and CTC by incorporating a transducer architecture [14]. The transducer framework, which includes an encoder, a prediction network, and a joint network, allows for more accurate and context-aware predictions. In BECTRA, the encoder is enhanced with BERT to capture rich linguistic features, while the prediction network is trained with an ASR-specific vocabulary [16]. This separation of the encoder and prediction network enables BECTRA to handle vocabulary mismatches between the pre-trained BERT model and the target ASR task, thereby improving the model's adaptability and performance [16]. The joint network in BECTRA combines the acoustic and text representations, leveraging the autoregressive nature of the transducer to reduce the conditional independence assumptions inherent in CTC models.

To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of BECTRA, a novel inference algorithm is proposed that combines the strengths of both autoregressive and non-autoregressive decoding methods [16]. This hybrid approach allows BECTRA to maintain the fast inference speed characteristic of non-autoregressive models while achieving the high accuracy typically associated with autoregressive models. The algorithm uses the transducer's joint network to dynamically integrate BERT's linguistic context with the acoustic features, ensuring that the final output is both linguistically coherent and acoustically accurate. This integration is particularly beneficial for tasks requiring high precision, such as SLU, where the context and meaning of the spoken content are crucial for accurate interpretation.

### 3.3.3 Non-Autoregressive Models for Joint ASR and SLU
Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models for joint Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) have gained significant attention due to their potential for reducing inference time and improving efficiency [4]. Unlike autoregressive models, which generate output tokens sequentially, NAR models can predict all tokens in parallel, making them highly suitable for real-time applications. This section explores the key advancements and challenges in NAR models for joint ASR and SLU, focusing on their integration, performance, and practical implications [4].

One of the primary challenges in NAR models is the degradation of recognition accuracy due to the lack of context in the decoding process. To address this, recent approaches have integrated self-attention mechanisms and transformer architectures to enhance the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies. For instance, the Mask-CTC and SC-CTC methods have been adapted to joint ASR and SLU tasks, where the encoder captures acoustic features and the decoder generates text and semantic labels simultaneously. These models leverage the parallel decoding capability of NAR models while incorporating contextual information through self-attention, thus improving both ASR and SLU performance [4].

Another significant development is the use of BERT-CTC-Transducer (BECTRA) models, which combine the strengths of BERT for language understanding and the transducer for ASR [14]. BECTRA models use a BERT-enhanced encoder to capture rich linguistic features and a transducer-based decoder to handle the ASR-specific vocabulary, ensuring accurate text generation [16]. This hybrid approach not only accelerates inference but also enhances the robustness of the model against ASR errors. Additionally, the integration of context representations from BERT into the attention mechanism of the transducer further improves the model's ability to handle complex dialogues and long-form interactions, making it a promising direction for future research in joint ASR and SLU systems [12].

# 4 Multimodal Approaches in ASR and SLU

## 4.1 Cross-Modal Integration and Fusion

### 4.1.1 Cascaded Cross-Modal Transformer for Speech Classification
The Cascaded Cross-Modal Transformer (CCMT) represents a significant advancement in the integration of speech and text modalities for speech classification tasks [7]. By leveraging the complementary strengths of both modalities, CCMT addresses the limitations of unimodal approaches, particularly in scenarios where ASR transcriptions are of low quality. The architecture of CCMT is designed to mitigate error propagation from ASR, a common issue in traditional pipeline systems, by incorporating a cascaded cross-attention mechanism that dynamically aligns and fuses features from both speech and text streams. This alignment is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the multimodal representation, especially when dealing with noisy or incomplete ASR outputs.

In the CCMT framework, the initial stages involve the extraction of high-level features from the raw speech signal using a pre-trained speech encoder, such as a variant of the wav2vec 2.0 model. These features are then passed through a series of transformer layers, which are designed to capture both local and global contextual information. Simultaneously, text features are extracted from the ASR transcripts using a pre-trained language model, such as BERT [12]. The text features are processed through a parallel set of transformer layers, allowing the model to encode syntactic and semantic information from the text. The cascaded cross-attention mechanism is introduced at the fusion stage, where the speech and text features are aligned and integrated. This mechanism ensures that the model can effectively leverage the strengths of both modalities, such as the temporal dynamics from speech and the semantic richness from text, to enhance the overall representation.

Empirical evaluations of the CCMT model on diverse speech classification tasks, including intent recognition, emotion detection, and speaker verification, have demonstrated significant improvements over unimodal baselines [7]. The robustness of the CCMT model is particularly evident in scenarios where ASR quality is poor, as the model's ability to cross-verify information from both modalities helps to mitigate the impact of transcription errors. Furthermore, the modular design of CCMT allows for easy adaptation to different tasks and datasets, making it a versatile tool in the speech processing toolkit. The success of CCMT underscores the importance of multimodal approaches in addressing the challenges of real-world speech classification tasks, where data quality and variability are significant concerns [7].

### 4.1.2 Multimodal Corpus and Multitasking Models
In the realm of multimodal corpus and multitasking models, the integration of speech and text data has emerged as a powerful approach to enhance the robustness and effectiveness of speech language understanding (SLU) systems [17]. Traditional SLU systems rely heavily on automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, which can introduce errors and propagate them through the pipeline [17]. To mitigate this issue, recent research has focused on developing multimodal architectures that combine both speech signals and text transcripts [17]. These models leverage the complementary information from different modalities to improve the overall performance and robustness of SLU systems, particularly in scenarios where ASR quality is suboptimal.

The creation of large-scale multimodal corpora has been a critical enabler for the development of these advanced models. These corpora typically consist of aligned speech and text data, which are essential for training models that can effectively fuse information from both modalities. For instance, the development of the SeamlessAlign corpus, which includes over 470,000 hours of automatically aligned speech translations, has provided a rich resource for training multitasking models [18]. These models are designed to perform multiple tasks, such as speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) and speech-to-text translation (S2TT), across a wide range of languages [18]. The use of such extensive and diverse datasets has been instrumental in improving the generalization and robustness of these models, allowing them to handle a variety of linguistic and acoustic variations.

Moreover, the architectural innovations in multimodal models have played a crucial role in their success. One notable approach is the cascaded cross-modal transformer (CCMT), which integrates speech and text data through a series of cross-attention mechanisms [7]. This architecture allows for the effective fusion of multimodal features, enabling the model to capture both the acoustic and lexical aspects of the input [19]. The CCMT model has demonstrated significant improvements in tasks such as speech emotion recognition, speaker verification, and text-to-speech synthesis. Additionally, the use of pre-trained models, such as XLSR for speech and BERT for text, has further enhanced the performance of these systems by leveraging transfer learning. The combination of these techniques has not only improved the accuracy of SLU systems but has also opened new avenues for research in multimodal machine learning.

### 4.1.3 Multimodal Diffusion Model for UTI Data Generation
In the realm of Unsupervised Tongue Imaging (UTI) data generation, the application of multimodal diffusion models represents a significant advancement, particularly in capturing the intricate details of tongue movements and their corresponding acoustic characteristics [8]. The proposed model leverages a two-stage process: conditional encoding and UTI data generation. During the conditional encoding stage, the model utilizes wav2vec2.0 to encode the acoustic features of speech, focusing on individual-specific attributes such as tongue movement patterns. This stage is crucial for extracting the nuanced acoustic information that is essential for generating realistic UTI data.

The second stage involves the actual generation of UTI data using a diffusion model. This stage builds upon the encoded acoustic features by integrating them with textual information, thereby enriching the multimodal representation [19]. The diffusion model iteratively refines the generated UTI data, ensuring that the final output closely matches the distribution and diversity of real UTI data. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial improvement in the quality of generated UTI data, with a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score decreasing from 256.80 to 22.02 [8]. This reduction in FID indicates that the generated UTI data not only exhibits a data distribution similar to real data but also maintains a high level of diversity, which is critical for clinical applications such as tongue function assessment [8].

Moreover, the proposed multimodal diffusion model addresses the limitations of traditional text-only or speech-only approaches by leveraging the complementary strengths of both modalities. The integration of speech and text data enhances the model's ability to capture the complex interplay between acoustic and linguistic features, leading to more accurate and detailed UTI data generation. This approach not only improves the fidelity of the generated data but also opens new avenues for research and clinical applications in speech and language disorders, where the visualization of tongue movements plays a vital role in diagnosis and treatment planning.

## 4.2 End-to-End Multimodal Models

### 4.2.1 Wave BERT for Spoken Language Understanding
Wave BERT (WaBERT) represents a significant advancement in the field of Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) by integrating speech and text modalities within a single, end-to-end model [20]. Unlike traditional cascaded approaches that rely on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to transcribe speech into text before applying Natural Language Understanding (NLU) techniques, WaBERT directly processes raw audio signals, thereby mitigating the error propagation from ASR. This model leverages the strengths of BERT, a transformer-based architecture pre-trained on large text corpora, and extends its capabilities to handle speech data, enabling a more robust extraction of semantic information from spoken language [21].

The core innovation of WaBERT lies in its modified Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) mechanism, which facilitates the alignment between speech and text modalities. This alignment is crucial for maintaining the temporal correspondence between the acoustic and lexical features, ensuring that the model can accurately map spoken words to their textual representations. By freezing most parameters of the pre-trained speech and language models during training, WaBERT achieves efficient and resource-effective training, making it a practical solution for SLU tasks [20]. This approach not only reduces the computational burden but also enhances the model's ability to generalize across different domains and languages, particularly in scenarios with limited training data.

In practical applications, WaBERT has demonstrated superior performance in various SLU tasks, including intent classification and slot filling, compared to traditional cascaded models. The model's ability to handle both speech and text data seamlessly allows it to capture the rich, multimodal nature of human communication, including prosodic and contextual cues that are often lost in ASR transcriptions [5]. This makes WaBERT a promising tool for developing more accurate and context-aware SLU systems, which are essential for applications such as virtual assistants, customer service chatbots, and personalized healthcare solutions.

### 4.2.2 Multi-Stage Speech Event Extraction Pipeline
The multi-stage Speech Event Extraction (SpeechEE) pipeline is designed to enhance the robustness and accuracy of event extraction from speech data by integrating multiple processing stages, each optimized for specific tasks. This pipeline typically begins with an advanced Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) module, which transcribes the speech input into text [22]. The choice of ASR is critical, as the quality of the transcription directly impacts the subsequent stages. High-performance ASR models, often fine-tuned on domain-specific data, are employed to minimize errors and provide accurate transcriptions. These models can be either off-the-shelf solutions or custom-trained to handle specific accents, languages, or environmental conditions.

Following the ASR stage, the pipeline incorporates a semantic search-enhanced prompting module that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract events from the transcribed text [23]. This module uses a few-shot learning strategy based on semantic similarity, which allows it to adapt to various text-related information extraction tasks without extensive retraining. The LLMs are prompted with examples that are semantically similar to the input text, enabling them to identify and extract relevant events more accurately. This approach not only improves the generalizability of the system but also enhances its ability to handle diverse and complex speech data.

Finally, the pipeline includes a speech segment classification module that selectively filters and processes utterances likely to contain events of interest [23]. This module uses machine learning techniques to classify speech segments based on their potential to contribute to the event extraction process. By filtering out irrelevant or low-quality segments, the pipeline ensures that the subsequent stages focus on the most informative parts of the speech data. This multi-stage approach, combining high-performance ASR, semantic search-enhanced prompting, and selective speech segment classification, provides a robust and efficient framework for Speech Event Extraction, capable of handling a wide range of applications and data complexities [23].

### 4.2.3 Spoken Dialect Identification with Multimodal Fusion
Spoken Dialect Identification (DID) with Multimodal Fusion represents a significant advancement in addressing the challenges posed by dialectal variations in speech processing systems. Traditional approaches to DID have primarily relied on acoustic models, which, while effective, often struggle with the subtle phonetic and prosodic differences that characterize dialects. By incorporating multimodal fusion, these systems can leverage both textual and acoustic information to enhance the robustness and accuracy of dialect identification. Specifically, the integration of text-based features, such as those derived from pre-trained language models like BERT and RoBERTa, with acoustic features extracted from speech signals, allows for a more comprehensive representation of the input data. This dual-modality approach helps mitigate the impact of ASR errors, which are particularly prevalent in dialectal speech due to the lack of standardized pronunciation and vocabulary.

The multimodal fusion framework typically involves a two-step process: feature extraction and feature fusion. In the feature extraction phase, acoustic features are obtained from the speech signal using techniques such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and prosodic features like pitch and energy contours. Textual features are simultaneously extracted from the ASR transcripts using language models [14]. These models are fine-tuned on dialect-specific data to capture the unique linguistic patterns of each dialect. During the feature fusion phase, the extracted acoustic and textual features are combined using various fusion strategies, such as concatenation, attention mechanisms, or more complex neural architectures like transformers. The choice of fusion strategy is crucial, as it determines how effectively the system can integrate the complementary information from both modalities.

Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets, including those with significant dialectal variations, have demonstrated the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in DID. For instance, on the Irish dialect identification task, where the presence of multiple sub-dialects poses a significant challenge, multimodal systems have shown improved performance over unimodal acoustic models. The inclusion of textual features, even from imperfect ASR transcripts, provides additional context that helps disambiguate between similar-sounding dialects. Furthermore, the use of pre-trained language models, which have been exposed to a wide range of linguistic contexts, enhances the system's ability to generalize across different dialects. This approach not only improves the accuracy of dialect identification but also contributes to the development of more inclusive and robust speech processing systems.

## 4.3 Ethical and Fairness Considerations

### 4.3.1 Gender Bias in ASR Models
Gender bias in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models has emerged as a critical issue, reflecting significant disparities in recognition accuracy across different genders [2]. Studies have consistently reported that ASR systems exhibit varying degrees of bias, often favoring one gender over another. For instance, some research indicates a higher recognition accuracy for male speakers, while others find the opposite trend, with better performance for female speakers. These discrepancies highlight the complexity and multifaceted nature of gender bias in ASR, influenced by factors such as the composition of training data, acoustic characteristics, and linguistic patterns.

The root causes of gender bias in ASR models are multifaceted. One primary factor is the imbalance in the representation of male and female speakers in the training datasets. Historically, many ASR systems have been trained on datasets that disproportionately include male voices, leading to models that perform better for male speakers [2]. Additionally, the acoustic properties of male and female voices, such as pitch and timbre, differ, which can affect how well ASR models capture and recognize speech from different genders [2]. Linguistic differences, such as variations in vocabulary and speaking styles, also contribute to these biases. Addressing these issues requires a concerted effort to balance the representation of genders in training data and to develop models that are more robust to acoustic and linguistic variations.

To mitigate gender bias in ASR models, several strategies have been proposed and explored. One approach involves collecting and incorporating more diverse and balanced datasets that include a representative sample of male and female speakers. Another strategy is to apply data augmentation techniques to artificially balance the representation of genders in the training data. Additionally, researchers have investigated the use of fairness-aware algorithms that explicitly account for and correct biases during the training process. These methods aim to ensure that ASR models perform equally well across different genders, thereby promoting fairness and reducing the risk of perpetuating social inequalities. Evaluating and monitoring the performance of ASR models across different demographic groups is also crucial for identifying and addressing biases in real-world applications.

### 4.3.2 Responsible AI in Multimodal Systems
Responsible AI in multimodal systems is a critical area of focus, particularly as these systems become more integrated into everyday applications such as virtual assistants and automated customer service. One of the primary concerns in responsible AI is the mitigation of biases and toxic content, which can arise from the complex interactions between different modalities [18]. In our research, we conducted extensive evaluations to assess the prevalence of added toxicity and gender bias in the outputs of our multimodal language understanding (MLU) system. Our findings indicate a low prevalence of added toxicity, ranging from 0.11% to 0.21% across various modalities, datasets, and translation directions. This is a significant improvement over state-of-the-art models, where added toxicity ranges from 26% to 63%.

To achieve these reductions, we implemented a series of techniques aimed at enhancing the fairness and transparency of our MLU system. These techniques include the use of debiasing algorithms during the training phase, which help to minimize the influence of biased data on the model's outputs. Additionally, we employed a cascaded cross-modal transformer (CCMT) architecture that effectively integrates speech and text data, allowing for a more balanced and nuanced representation of multimodal inputs [7]. This architecture ensures that the model does not disproportionately rely on one modality over the other, thereby reducing the risk of amplifying biases present in either the audio or textual data.

Furthermore, we conducted both automatic and human evaluations to comprehensively assess the robustness and fairness of our MLU system. The automatic evaluations involved metrics such as the Toxicity Score and Gender Bias Index, which quantified the level of harmful content and gender skew in the model's outputs. Human evaluations, on the other hand, provided qualitative insights into the perceived fairness and appropriateness of the system's responses. These evaluations confirmed that our MLU system not only performs well in terms of accuracy and robustness but also adheres to ethical standards by minimizing the generation of biased or toxic content. Overall, our work highlights the importance of responsible AI practices in the development of multimodal systems and sets a benchmark for future research in this area.

### 4.3.3 Bias Mitigation in Multilingual Pre-Training
Bias mitigation in multilingual pre-training is a critical aspect of ensuring equitable performance across different languages and demographic groups. Multilingual models, such as Multilingual-BERT and XLM-RoBERTa, are designed to handle a diverse array of languages by sharing a common set of parameters [24]. However, these models often exhibit performance disparities, particularly for low-resource languages and underrepresented demographic groups. The primary challenge lies in the interference and capacity dilution that occurs when training on a large number of languages, leading to degraded performance for high-resource languages and insufficient learning for low-resource ones.

To address these biases, several strategies have been proposed. One approach involves data selection and weighting techniques, where the training data is carefully curated to ensure balanced representation across languages. For instance, guided masking and soft weighting of data based on confidence scores can help mitigate the impact of noisy or low-quality data. Additionally, fine-tuning on specific languages or demographic groups can help tailor the model to perform better on underrepresented segments. Another strategy is to incorporate domain-specific data or augment the training corpus with synthetic data to enhance the model's exposure to diverse linguistic contexts.

Furthermore, the integration of auxiliary tasks during pre-training can also aid in bias mitigation. Tasks such as masked language modeling, next sentence prediction, and cross-lingual alignment can help the model learn more robust and generalized representations. These auxiliary tasks encourage the model to capture deeper semantic and syntactic structures, thereby reducing the reliance on superficial patterns that may be biased. Ultimately, a combination of data-centric and model-centric approaches is essential for effectively mitigating biases in multilingual pre-training, ensuring that the resulting models are fair and performant across a wide range of languages and user demographics [25].

# 5 Application of ASR in Diverse Systems

## 5.1 Spoken Content Retrieval and Scene Graph Grounding

### 5.1.1 BERT-based Re-ranking and Dense Retrieval
Transformer-based Information Retrieval (IR) models, particularly those leveraging BERT, have revolutionized the field by offering significant improvements over traditional models like BM25 [26]. BERT-based re-ranking and dense retrieval (DR) models are two prominent approaches within this category. BERT-based re-ranking models, such as MonoBERT, operate by taking a query-document pair and computing a relevance score using the deep contextualized embeddings provided by BERT. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the semantic relationship between the query and the document, leading to higher precision in retrieval tasks. However, these models are typically used as a second stage, refining the results from an initial retrieval phase, which can be computationally expensive.

In contrast, BERT-based dense retrieval models aim to directly map queries and documents into a dense vector space, where similarity can be efficiently computed using dot products. This method significantly reduces the computational overhead compared to re-ranking, making it suitable for large-scale applications. Despite their efficiency, dense retrieval models face challenges in capturing the fine-grained semantic nuances that re-ranking models excel at. To address this, recent research has focused on enhancing dense retrieval models with additional training strategies and data augmentation techniques, such as semi-supervised learning, to improve their performance.

Our investigation into BERT-based re-ranking and dense retrieval for spoken instruction videos revealed that, despite the advancements in BERT-based models, there remains a notable gap in search effectiveness between manual and ASR-generated transcripts, ranging from 10-14% [26]. This gap highlights the importance of improving ASR accuracy, especially in domain-specific contexts. To mitigate this issue, we augmented the ASR system using semi-supervised training for domain adaptation, which led to a significant reduction in the error rate. Additionally, we explored early and late fusion extensions using ASR N-best transcripts for a BERT DR system, demonstrating that these techniques can further enhance the performance of BERT-based retrieval models in handling spoken content [26].

### 5.1.2 Speech-Scene Graph Grounding Network
The Speech-Scene Graph Grounding Network (SGGNet2) represents a significant advancement in the integration of speech recognition and scene understanding, particularly in the context of robotic navigation [22]. This network is designed to robustly identify and locate target objects within a robot's environment based on spoken commands, addressing the common issue of ASR misconversion. By leveraging the acoustic properties of words, SGGNet2 maps speech inputs to corresponding latent encodings that are closely related to the objects and actions in the scene graph [22]. This mapping is achieved through a deep learning architecture that is trained to recognize the subtle acoustic features that distinguish different words and phrases, thereby enhancing the accuracy of object identification and action execution in real-world scenarios.

A key innovation of SGGNet2 is its ability to transfer the latent encodings from the speech recognition module to the scene graph grounding network, creating a unified and end-to-end system [22]. This transfer process is facilitated by a carefully designed neural network that ensures the consistency and coherence of the acoustic and visual representations. The network is trained using a diverse dataset that includes both speech commands and corresponding scene graphs, enabling it to generalize well across different environments and tasks. The robustness of SGGNet2 is further demonstrated through its application in a Korean navigation dataset, where it outperforms traditional frameworks in terms of grounding accuracy and reliability.

To validate the effectiveness of SGGNet2, a real-world demonstration was conducted using a quadruped robot, RBQ-3, equipped with NVIDIANeMo ASR for speech recognition. The robot was tasked with navigating through a complex environment based on spoken commands, and the results showed a significant improvement in task completion accuracy compared to previous methods. This practical application highlights the potential of SGGNet2 in enhancing the interaction between humans and robots, particularly in scenarios where precise and reliable object identification and navigation are critical. The network's ability to handle the nuances of spoken language, combined with its robust scene understanding capabilities, opens up new possibilities for the development of more sophisticated and user-friendly robotic systems.

### 5.1.3 Hybrid Local-Remote Computing for Robotic Arms
Hybrid local-remote computing for robotic arms represents a sophisticated approach to balancing computational demands and real-time performance. In this paradigm, the robotic arm's onboard system handles critical, time-sensitive tasks such as motor control and collision avoidance, ensuring immediate response to environmental changes and maintaining operational safety. Meanwhile, more complex and computationally intensive tasks, such as natural language processing and advanced decision-making, are offloaded to remote servers. This division of labor leverages the strengths of both local and remote computing environments, optimizing resource utilization and enhancing overall system efficiency.

The integration of hybrid local-remote computing in robotic arms involves sophisticated data transfer and processing mechanisms. For instance, sensor data from the robotic arm, including visual and auditory inputs, is transmitted to remote servers for processing. At the remote end, powerful computational resources are employed to convert audio inputs into text using models like Whisper, and to interpret the context and intent of commands using natural language understanding (NLU) models like BERT. The processed information is then sent back to the robotic arm, which executes the corresponding actions. This process requires low-latency communication channels and efficient data compression techniques to ensure that the delay between command issuance and execution is minimal.

To further optimize the hybrid computing model, various strategies are employed to enhance the system's adaptability and performance. For example, dynamic task allocation algorithms can intelligently decide which tasks should be processed locally and which should be offloaded, based on the current computational load and network conditions. Additionally, machine learning techniques can be used to predict the computational requirements of different tasks, allowing for proactive resource allocation. This approach not only improves the responsiveness of the robotic arm but also reduces the overall computational overhead, making the system more scalable and robust in diverse operational environments.

## 5.2 Rumor Detection and Knowledge Graphs

### 5.2.1 Contrastive Learning for Rumor Detection
Contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful technique for rumor detection, leveraging the ability to learn robust representations from multimodal data [27]. In the context of rumor detection, contrastive learning is employed to distinguish between authentic and misleading information by capturing the intricate relationships between different modalities, such as text, images, and videos. The core idea is to construct a learning framework that can effectively align and contrast positive and negative samples, thereby enhancing the model's discriminative power. This is achieved by optimizing a contrastive loss function that encourages the model to bring similar samples closer together in the feature space while pushing dissimilar ones apart.

The application of contrastive learning in rumor detection involves several key steps. First, a multimodal dataset is constructed, where each sample consists of a combination of text, images, and videos, along with labels indicating whether the content is true or false. Temporal Segment Networks (TSN) are often used to extract video features, while deep neural networks (DNNs) such as BERT are employed for text encoding. These features are then fused using an attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh different modalities based on their relevance to the task. The contrastive loss is then applied to the fused representations, ensuring that the model can effectively differentiate between true and false information. This approach not only improves the accuracy of rumor detection but also enhances the model's robustness to various types of misinformation.

Recent advancements in contrastive learning have led to the development of more sophisticated models that can handle the complexities of multimodal rumor detection [27]. For instance, some studies have introduced hierarchical attention mechanisms that can capture both local and global context, further improving the model's ability to discern subtle cues that may indicate the presence of a rumor. Additionally, the integration of external knowledge sources, such as social media metadata and user interaction patterns, has been shown to complement the contrastive learning framework, providing additional context that can aid in the detection of rumors. These advancements highlight the potential of contrastive learning in addressing the challenges of rumor detection in a multimodal setting [27].

### 5.2.2 Hybrid Knowledge Graph and Deep Learning QA System
Hybrid Knowledge Graph (KG) and Deep Learning (DL) systems have emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing Question Answering (QA) capabilities, particularly in complex and specialized domains such as aviation and audio processing [28]. These systems leverage the structured and semantically rich information stored in KGs, combined with the powerful feature extraction and reasoning capabilities of DL models. The integration of these two paradigms addresses the limitations of using either approach in isolation. For instance, while KGs excel in providing context and structured information, they often struggle with handling unstructured or noisy data. Conversely, DL models, particularly those based on transformer architectures like BERT and GPT-3, are adept at processing and understanding unstructured text but may lack the context and depth of knowledge that KGs provide.

In the proposed hybrid system, the KG serves as a knowledge base that stores domain-specific information, such as aviation accident reports and audio metadata, which are crucial for accurate QA. The DL component, specifically BERT and GPT-3, is employed to process user queries and extract relevant features. The system first routes the user query through an intent classifier to determine the appropriate domain and then uses the KG to retrieve relevant information. This information is then fed into the DL model, which generates the final answer. The synergy between the KG and DL components allows the system to handle complex queries that require both deep domain knowledge and natural language understanding. For example, in the aviation domain, the system can effectively answer questions that involve temporal reasoning and causal relationships, which are critical for understanding accident scenarios.

The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid approach. The combined system, referred to as KGQA + BERT-QA, achieves a significant improvement in accuracy, with a 7% increase over the KGQA module and a 40.3% increase over the BERT-QA module alone. Similarly, the KGQA + GPT-3-QA system shows a 29.3% and 9.3% increase in accuracy over the KGQA and GPT-3-QA modules, respectively [28]. These improvements highlight the complementary strengths of the KG and DL components, where the structured knowledge from the KG enhances the context-awareness of the DL models, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant answers. The hybrid system thus represents a robust and versatile solution for QA tasks in specialized domains, setting a new standard for integrating structured and unstructured data in AI applications.

### 5.2.3 Virtual Simulation-Pilot System for ATC Training
The development of a virtual simulation-pilot system for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training represents a significant advancement in the field, aiming to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of training programs for Air Traffic Controllers (ATCos) [29]. This system leverages advanced computational models and simulation technologies to create a realistic training environment that can adapt to various scenarios and training needs. By integrating natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms, the virtual simulation-pilot can interpret and respond to ATCo trainees' commands, thereby providing immediate feedback and dynamic interaction, which are crucial for skill development [29].

One of the key benefits of the virtual simulation-pilot system is its ability to reduce the dependency on human simulation-pilots, who are often required to manually simulate aircraft responses during training sessions. This reduction not only decreases the overall training costs but also increases the scalability of the training program, allowing for more frequent and diverse training exercises. The modular design of the system enables the incorporation of domain-specific contextual data, such as real-time air traffic information, weather conditions, and emergency scenarios, thus enriching the training experience and preparing ATCos for a wide range of operational challenges.

Moreover, the virtual simulation-pilot system supports continuous learning and assessment by generating detailed performance metrics and analytics. These insights help trainers identify areas where individual ATCos may need additional focus or practice, facilitating a more personalized and adaptive training approach. The system's flexibility and adaptability make it a valuable tool for both initial training and ongoing professional development, ultimately contributing to higher standards of safety and efficiency in air traffic control operations.

## 5.3 Audio-Related Query Handling and CARI

### 5.3.1 Candidate Retrieval Algorithm for Misspelled N-grams
In the realm of spoken content retrieval (SCR), the challenge of handling misspelled n-grams in automatic speech recognition (ASR) outputs is a critical issue that can significantly degrade the performance of retrieval systems [24]. Traditional methods, such as those based on edit distance, have been widely used to address misspellings but suffer from computational inefficiency and limited accuracy, especially when dealing with a large vocabulary. To overcome these limitations, a novel candidate retrieval algorithm has been proposed, which leverages misspelled n-gram mappings to efficiently identify potential correct spellings for ASR hypotheses [30].

The core of this algorithm involves preselecting the top 10 candidates from the user vocabulary that are most likely to match the ASR hypothesis. This selection process is based on a combination of phonetic similarity and contextual relevance, ensuring that the candidates are both plausible and contextually appropriate. Once the candidates are identified, they are concatenated with the original ASR output and passed through a non-autoregressive spellchecker based on the BERT architecture [30]. This spellchecker is designed to correct the ASR output by considering the context provided by the concatenated candidates, thereby improving the accuracy of the final transcription.

This approach not only addresses the computational inefficiencies associated with edit distance methods but also enhances the robustness of the system in handling a wide range of misspellings and phonetic variations. The use of BERT for non-autoregressive spellchecking allows for parallel processing of multiple candidates, significantly reducing the time required for correction [30]. Additionally, the synthetic generation of training datasets ensures that the model is well-equipped to handle a diverse set of misspellings and n-gram variations, making it a versatile solution for improving the accuracy of ASR outputs in SCR systems.

### 5.3.2 Audio Processing in Chatbot Systems
Audio processing in chatbot systems is a critical component that enables the effective handling of audio-related queries, thereby enhancing the overall user experience [9]. Traditional chatbots, such as LUIS, DialogFlow, and Lex, have primarily focused on text and speech processing, often falling short in addressing the complexities of audio content [9]. These systems typically excel in tasks like speech-to-text (STT) conversion and basic intent recognition but struggle with more nuanced audio-related tasks, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and context-aware responses. The limitations of these systems highlight the need for a more comprehensive approach that integrates advanced audio processing models.

To address these limitations, the proposed chatbot system incorporates a multi-stage audio processing pipeline designed to handle a wide range of audio-related queries [9]. The pipeline begins with an intent classifier that accurately routes user queries to the appropriate audio expert module. This classifier is trained on a diverse dataset of audio queries, ensuring it can effectively distinguish between different types of audio tasks, such as music recognition, speech analysis, and environmental sound classification. Once the query is routed, the corresponding audio expert module processes the audio content using specialized models, such as Wav2Vec 2.0 for ASR, BERT for natural language understanding (NLU), and FastSpeech2 for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. This modular architecture allows for the seamless integration of new audio processing models as they become available, ensuring the system remains up-to-date with the latest advancements in audio technology.

The effectiveness of the audio processing pipeline is further enhanced by the use of advanced techniques such as voice activity detection (VAD), diarization, and acoustic feature extraction. VAD is used to accurately identify speech segments within the audio, reducing processing time and improving the accuracy of subsequent tasks. Diarization helps in separating different speakers in multi-speaker audio, which is crucial for applications like meeting transcription and customer service interactions. Acoustic feature extraction, combined with deep learning models, enables the system to perform sophisticated tasks such as emotion detection and speaker verification. These techniques, when integrated into the chatbot system, not only improve the accuracy of audio processing but also enhance the system's ability to provide contextually relevant and personalized responses to users.

### 5.3.3 ASR in Computer-Assisted Recorded Interviews
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of computer-assisted recorded interviews (CARI) within the Social Sciences and Humanities Open Cloud (SSHOC) project. ASR technology is employed to transcribe audio recordings of participant responses, thereby facilitating subsequent text analyses such as sentiment analysis and thematic coding. The integration of ASR in CARI not only accelerates the transcription process but also ensures consistency and reduces the potential for human error in manual transcription. Advanced ASR models, such as Wav2Vec 2.0 and XLSR, are fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets to improve recognition accuracy, especially in noisy environments or with non-standard speech patterns [1].

The application of ASR in CARI involves several stages, starting with the preprocessing of audio files to remove background noise and normalize volume levels. Once the audio is prepared, it is fed into the ASR model, which generates a transcript of the spoken content. Post-processing steps, such as contextual spelling correction (CSC), are then applied to refine the transcript by correcting errors and aligning the text with domain-specific terminology [31]. This refined transcript serves as the input for higher-level analyses, including sentiment analysis and topic modeling, which provide deeper insights into the participants' responses. The use of ASR in this context not only streamlines the data collection and analysis process but also enhances the reliability and validity of the research findings.

Moreover, the integration of ASR in CARI supports the development of more sophisticated query capabilities. Researchers can leverage the transcribed data to perform complex searches and extract specific segments of interest, such as instances where participants discuss particular topics or express certain emotions. This capability is particularly valuable in longitudinal studies where the volume of recorded data can be substantial. By automating the transcription process, ASR enables researchers to focus on higher-order tasks, such as data interpretation and hypothesis testing, ultimately contributing to more robust and nuanced research outcomes.

# 6 Future Directions


Despite the significant advancements in the integration of BERT and CTC Transformers for automatic speech recognition (ASR), several limitations and gaps remain. Current models still struggle with handling diverse acoustic conditions, low-resource languages, and complex linguistic structures. The integration of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques has shown promise, but these approaches often require substantial computational resources and may not be feasible for real-time applications. Additionally, the transfer of knowledge from LLMs to ASR models is not always seamless, and there is a need for more efficient and effective methods to bridge the gap between text and speech modalities. Ethical and fairness considerations, such as gender bias and responsible AI practices, also remain critical challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the equitable and ethical deployment of ASR systems.

To address these limitations, several directions for future research are proposed. First, the development of more efficient and resource-friendly models that can handle real-time ASR tasks with high accuracy is essential. This could involve exploring lightweight architectures, such as distillation techniques and early exiting mechanisms, to reduce computational complexity without compromising performance. Second, the creation of large-scale, diverse, and representative datasets for training ASR models is crucial. These datasets should include a wide range of accents, languages, and acoustic conditions to improve the robustness and generalizability of ASR systems. Third, the integration of multimodal approaches, combining speech, text, and other sensory data, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the input and enhance the performance of ASR systems. For example, the use of visual context in multimodal ASR can help disambiguate speech in noisy environments and improve recognition accuracy.

Another promising direction is the exploration of advanced training techniques, such as meta-learning and few-shot learning, to improve the adaptability of ASR models to new and unseen data. These techniques can help models quickly adjust to new languages or dialects with minimal additional training, making ASR systems more versatile and user-friendly. Additionally, the development of more sophisticated knowledge distillation methods that can effectively transfer linguistic knowledge from LLMs to ASR models is a critical area of research. This could involve the use of attention mechanisms and auxiliary tasks to ensure that the ASR model can leverage the rich contextual information provided by LLMs.

The potential impact of these proposed future research directions is substantial. Enhanced ASR systems that are more efficient, robust, and adaptable will significantly improve the user experience in a wide range of applications, from virtual assistants and customer service to real-time translation and voice-controlled devices. By addressing ethical and fairness considerations, these systems can also contribute to more inclusive and equitable technology, ensuring that they serve a diverse and global user base. Moreover, the integration of multimodal and advanced training techniques will open up new possibilities for research and development, driving innovation in the field of speech recognition and natural language processing.
