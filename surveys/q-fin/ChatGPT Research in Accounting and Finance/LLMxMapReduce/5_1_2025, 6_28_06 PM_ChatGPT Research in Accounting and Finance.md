Within AI, machine learning (ML) represents a subset of methods where system performance improves through experience, typically by analyzing historical data or previous examples [40]. ML techniques encompass approaches such as supervised and unsupervised learning [40]. Deep learning, a term describing complex neural networks inspired by the human brain structure, constitutes a significant component of modern ML [40]. Generative AI (GenAI), a more recent advancement, focuses on creating new content, such as text, images, or synthetic data, distinct from discriminative AI models used for tasks like classification or prediction [14,24].  

The financial sector has historically been an early adopter of technological advancements. The evolution of AI and ML in finance reflects a progression from rule-based systems to increasingly sophisticated data-driven models. Early applications might be characterized by online advisors offering standardized guidance, progressing towards robo-advisors that automate portfolio management based on algorithms [26]. The rise of machine-readable data, increased computing power, and growing interest in alternative data sources like news articles, social media, and satellite imagery have further accelerated this evolution [33]. Traditional econometric methods often struggle to handle these large, unstructured, and  

high-dimensional datasets [33]. In contrast, ML models offer the computational power and flexibility necessary to decipher complex patterns within such data environments, proving suitable for tasks like detecting outliers, extracting features, and performing complex classification and regression analyses where classical models may fall short [33]. This has enabled diverse applications in finance and accounting, including predictive analysis, risk assessment, fraud detection, portfolio optimization, automated compliance checks, customer support, market analysis, document processing, and the analysis and processing of large amounts of accounting data [9,23,24,43,44]. LLM-powered AI software, for instance, can efficiently auto-categorize accounts and integrate data from multiple sources [18].  

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, represent a significant advancement in AI, particularly within the realm of natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI [26,28,37]. LLMs are characterized by their vast number of parameters and complex architectures, trained on extensive datasets to understand and generate human-like text [3,12,37]. The development of NLP has evolved from early methods relying on grammar rules to modern techniques leveraging artificial neural networks and deep learning [28]. Key milestones in this evolution include models like recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM), culminating in the highly effective Transformer-based architectures [8,28].​  

ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI, is based on the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model [12,37]. Its underlying mechanism draws from the "Attention Is All You Need" paper (2017), which introduced the Transformer neural network architecture [12]. The Transformer model utilizes a self-attention mechanism (specifically Multihead Attention) that allows it to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence, capturing complex dependencies and contexts across long texts more effectively and enabling parallel processing, which can lead to lower training costs compared to previous architectures [8,12]. ChatGPT is trained on extensive language datasets collected through methods like web crawling, which are then filtered and cleaned [10,29]. The training process involves optimizing and adjusting the model based on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), a crucial step that enhances the accuracy, controllability, and overall quality of human-computer dialogue by aligning the model's output with human preferences and instructions [10,12].​  

ChatGPT's core functionalities include advanced natural language understanding (NLU) and text generation [1,12,26,28]. It can analyze input questions and text context to generate relevant, coherent, and contextually appropriate responses [12]. Its generative capability allows it to predict the next token based on preceding ones, akin to auto-completion [29]. This enables applications ranging from answering user questions and completing creative writing tasks to generating code and engaging in complex dialogues [12,34]. ChatGPT can communicate in different languages and styles, adapting responses based on dialogue history and user needs [12,26]. OpenAI views large language models like GPT as crucial for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) [28]. The GPT model has evolved through several versions, including GPT-3, GPT-4 (with significantly more parameters and enhanced capabilities like dialogue and image input), and GPT-4o, which represents a further upgrade towards end-to-end training across text, vision, and audio, signaling a trend towards multimodal models [28,29].​  

Comparing ChatGPT and similar LLMs with other AI models highlights their unique strengths and current limitations. While traditional ML models excel at specific tasks like predictive analysis or classification on structured data, LLMs shine in tasks requiring sophisticated language understanding, generation, and complex pattern recognition in unstructured text [1,33]. LLMs like ChatGPT can process and integrate diverse textual data sources, which is challenging for classical methods [4,30]. However, current LLMs, including ChatGPT, primarily rely on statistical optimization for generating responses and may lack true comprehension of the underlying content [45]. They also face limitations in performing complex calculations and quantitative analyses, which are critical in fields like accounting [1]. The field of LLMs includes various implementations beyond OpenAI's GPT series, such as Gemini, Claude, and Llama2, which differ in parameter scale, fine-tuning, and availability [5,29]. Furthermore, the development of finance-specific LLMs, trained on specialized financial language, aims to provide more precise and actionable insights compared to general-purpose models [3]. Despite challenges related to content credibility, data security, and implementation costs, the trend is towards large-scale pre-trained models with multimodality and diverse capabilities, often envisioned as part of an intelligent system where large and small models collaborate with cloud and edge computing [36].​

A balanced approach to AI adoption is essential, ensuring that technological innovation serves the core principles and compliance baselines of the professions [2]. Implementing frameworks for responsible AI innovation, involving innovators, regulators, and stakeholders, can help ensure that AI tools align with social values and ethical standards [34,35]. Furthermore, enhancing data governance is crucial to ensure efficient and compliant data flow within organizations [37].​  

Despite the progress made, the field requires further research to fully understand and leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT and generative AI in accounting and finance [21,22,26,33]. Future research should address unanswered questions, provide technical guidance for researchers utilizing LLMs as tools, explore adapting smaller LLMs for specific tasks like sentiment analysis through fine-tuning [41], and investigate the impact of integrating multi-source data and enhancing model algorithms for prediction accuracy [13]. The rapid impact of generative AI on company value also suggests fertile ground for future research on its effects on company policies [8].​  

To effectively navigate the evolving landscape shaped by AI, a collaborative effort is required from researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Professionals must commit to continuous learning and skill development, particularly in AI literacy, to remain competitive and take on more strategic roles [10,25,43,45]. Employers need to support this development and adapt strategies to integrate AI while ensuring human oversight [1,10]. Policymakers and institutions, like those providing resources for accountants and finance professionals [11], must work towards establishing regulatory frameworks and standards that promote responsible development and deployment. By finding a dynamic balance between technology empowerment and professional adherence [2], the accounting and finance industries can unlock the full potential of AI for innovation, efficiency, and improved decision-making while mitigating risks and ensuring ethical practice.​
