# 3 Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

## 3.1 Frequency Domain and Dynamic Convolution

### 3.1.1 Frequency Attention and Dynamic Convolution for High-Resolution Imagery
Frequency Attention and Dynamic Convolution (FADConv) have emerged as crucial techniques for enhancing the processing of high-resolution imagery. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often treat all spatial positions uniformly, leading to a failure in capturing the intricate spatial dependencies and frequency characteristics inherent in high-resolution images. This simplistic aggregation results in significant feature information loss, which becomes a critical bottleneck in the performance of dynamic convolution methods. To address this, the Frequency Attention (FAT) module has been introduced, which transforms spatial features into the frequency domain using 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and fuses multi-spectral components to derive frequency-aware attention weights [1]. This approach allows the model to better capture the nuanced spatial and frequency information, thereby improving feature discrimination and generalization.

The FAT module is designed to dynamically adjust the weights of expert kernels in the convolutional layer based on the frequency characteristics of the input features. By doing so, FADConv can adaptively focus on different frequency bands, ensuring that the convolutional operations are more aligned with the intrinsic properties of the input data [1]. This adaptability is particularly beneficial in high-resolution imagery, where the presence of high-frequency details and low-frequency structures requires a more sophisticated handling mechanism. The integration of the FAT module into existing dynamic convolution frameworks, such as ODConv and KW, has demonstrated significant improvements in performance, validating the versatility and effectiveness of frequency-aware attention in enhancing feature representation and model generalization [1].

Moreover, the FADConv framework not only improves the accuracy and robustness of high-resolution image processing but also enhances the computational efficiency of the model. By selectively focusing on relevant frequency components, the method reduces the computational overhead associated with processing large and complex images. This efficiency is crucial for real-world applications, such as remote sensing, medical imaging, and autonomous driving, where high-resolution imagery is prevalent and computational resources are often limited. The combination of frequency attention and dynamic convolution thus represents a promising direction for advancing the state-of-the-art in high-resolution image analysis and processing.

### 3.1.2 Path-Integral Formalism and Viral Lattice Theory for Complex Environments
The path-integral formalism has emerged as a powerful tool in the theoretical analysis of complex systems, particularly in environments characterized by high uncertainty and nonlinearity. This formalism, rooted in quantum mechanics, allows for the integration of all possible paths a system can take between two points, providing a comprehensive probabilistic description of its behavior. In the context of viral dynamics, the path-integral approach can capture the stochastic nature of viral replication and spread, integrating the effects of environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and host immune responses. By treating viral particles as quantum-like entities, this formalism facilitates the modeling of viral evolution and the emergence of drug resistance, offering insights that are difficult to obtain through classical deterministic models.

Viral lattice theory, on the other hand, extends the path-integral formalism by incorporating the spatial and temporal dynamics of viral infections within a lattice structure. This theory models the environment as a lattice, where each node represents a potential site of viral interaction, such as a cell or a group of cells. The lattice approach allows for the explicit consideration of local interactions and the propagation of viral particles through the network. By mapping the viral dynamics onto a lattice, researchers can simulate the spread of viruses in complex environments, including those with heterogeneous populations and varying environmental conditions. This method is particularly useful for understanding the role of spatial heterogeneity in the transmission and control of viral diseases, as it can account for the non-uniform distribution of susceptible hosts and the spatial clustering of infections.

The integration of path-integral formalism and viral lattice theory provides a robust framework for analyzing viral dynamics in complex, real-world scenarios. This combined approach not only enhances our understanding of viral behavior at a microscale but also offers practical applications in the design of antiviral strategies and the prediction of epidemic outcomes. By leveraging the strengths of both methodologies, researchers can develop more accurate and comprehensive models of viral spread, which are essential for informing public health policies and intervention strategies. The ability to simulate and predict the impact of environmental factors on viral transmission is particularly valuable in the context of emerging infectious diseases, where rapid and informed decision-making is critical.

### 3.1.3 Koopman Operator Theory and Invertible Neural Networks for Data-Driven PDEs
The integration of Koopman operator theory and invertible neural networks represents a significant advancement in the data-driven modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs) for nonlinear dynamical systems. The Koopman operator, originally defined as an infinite-dimensional linear operator acting on a Hilbert space spanned by observable functions, provides a powerful framework for transforming inherently nonlinear systems into linear ones. This transformation is crucial for simplifying the analysis and prediction of complex dynamics, which are often encountered in fields such as fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and biological systems.

Invertible neural networks (INNs) play a pivotal role in this integration by parameterizing both the observable function and its inverse using the same set of trainable parameters. This dual parameterization ensures that the learned mappings are bijective, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of the underlying dynamical system. By leveraging INNs, the Koopman operator can be approximated in a finite-dimensional space, making it computationally feasible to apply to real-world problems. The resulting model, known as the Invertible Koopman Neural Operator (IKNO), combines the strengths of the Koopman operator's linearization capabilities with the flexibility and expressiveness of neural networks.

The IKNO framework has demonstrated significant potential in various engineering applications, including the simulation of airfoil flows and the modeling of urban microclimates. These applications benefit from the IKNO's ability to accurately capture and predict the behavior of complex systems with reduced computational overhead. Moreover, the neural operator theory, which underpins the IKNO, extends the applicability of the Koopman operator to a broader range of PDEs, thereby opening new avenues for research and innovation in data-driven scientific computing [2]. The combination of these theoretical and practical advancements positions the IKNO as a promising tool for advancing the state-of-the-art in the numerical solution of PDEs.

## 3.2 Multimodal and Large-Scale Datasets

### 3.2.1 Temporal Multi-Turn Dialogue for Streaming Videos
Temporal multi-turn dialogue for streaming videos represents a novel and challenging task that requires large visual-linguistic models (LVLMs) to engage in a series of consecutive, context-aware dialogues over segments of a video [3]. This task is particularly demanding because it necessitates the model to not only understand the current video content but also to maintain a coherent conversation that builds upon previous interactions. To achieve this, we define a QA chain as a sequence of multi-turn dialogues over a specific video segment, where each turn in the dialogue is linked to the previous one through common elements such as people, events, and objects [3].

The concept of Temporal Linkages is crucial in this context, as it ensures that the dialogue remains temporally coherent and relevant to the evolving content of the video. These linkages are established by identifying and tracking the common elements across successive QA chains, allowing the model to leverage historical context to inform its responses. This is particularly important in streaming scenarios, where the content is dynamic and the dialogue must adapt to new information as it becomes available. The ability to maintain and update this context over time is a key differentiator of LVLMs in handling temporal multi-turn dialogue.

To evaluate the effectiveness of LVLMs in this task, we have curated a dataset comprising 49,979 QA pairs, with an average of 36.94 pairs per video, which is the highest among known video datasets. This dataset is designed to assess the model's capability to reason through time and maintain a coherent dialogue. Additionally, we have constructed temporal dialogue paths that align with the progression of the video, ensuring that the model can effectively handle the temporal dynamics of streaming content. This evaluation framework provides a robust basis for assessing the performance of LVLMs in real-world streaming scenarios, highlighting the importance of both temporal coherence and contextual understanding in multi-turn dialogue systems [3].

### 3.2.2 Visual Token Selection for Efficient Multimodal Inference
Visual token selection is a critical component in efficient multimodal inference, particularly in scenarios where computational resources are limited. The primary goal of visual token selection is to reduce the computational burden by identifying and retaining the most informative tokens while discarding redundant or less relevant ones [4]. This process is essential for maintaining model accuracy and efficiency, especially in real-time applications where latency is a key concern. Various methods have been proposed to achieve this, ranging from attention-based mechanisms to more sophisticated techniques that leverage the intrinsic properties of visual data.

One of the most widely used approaches for visual token selection is the attention mechanism, which assigns importance scores to each token based on its relevance to the task at hand [4]. Attention mechanisms, such as those used in transformers, dynamically adjust the focus on different parts of the input, allowing the model to prioritize the most salient features. However, these methods often suffer from computational overhead, as they require the computation of attention weights for every token [4]. To address this, recent research has explored more efficient variants, such as sparse attention and hierarchical attention, which reduce the computational complexity by focusing on a subset of tokens or by structuring the attention process in a hierarchical manner.

Another approach to visual token selection involves the use of clustering and summarization techniques. These methods aim to group similar tokens together and select a representative subset that captures the essential information. For example, k-means clustering can be used to identify clusters of similar tokens, and the centroid of each cluster can be selected as the representative token. Additionally, techniques such as non-maximum suppression (NMS) and greedy selection algorithms have been employed to further refine the selection process. These methods not only reduce the number of tokens but also ensure that the selected tokens are diverse and cover the key aspects of the input data. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches require careful tuning of parameters and may not always generalize well across different tasks and datasets.

### 3.2.3 Multimodal Agricultural Dataset for Enhanced Decision-Making
Multimodal agricultural datasets play a crucial role in enhancing decision-making processes within the agricultural sector by integrating diverse data sources such as images, text, and sensor data [5]. These datasets are designed to support a wide range of tasks, including disease classification, disease detection, tool selection, visual question answering (VQA), and agent evaluation. By combining these modalities, the datasets enable a more comprehensive understanding of agricultural environments, which is essential for developing robust and adaptive agricultural management systems. For instance, high-resolution images can provide detailed insights into crop health, while sensor data can offer real-time information on environmental conditions, such as soil moisture and temperature.

To support these advanced applications, a multimodal agricultural dataset has been curated, consisting of five key components: disease classification, disease detection, tool selection, VQA, and agent evaluation [5]. Each component is meticulously structured to address specific challenges in agricultural decision-making. For disease classification and detection, the dataset includes labeled images of crops affected by various diseases, along with corresponding sensor data. This integration allows for the development of models that can accurately identify and localize diseases, even in complex and varied environments. The tool selection component, on the other hand, provides a framework for selecting the most appropriate agricultural tools or interventions based on the current state of the crops and environmental conditions.

The VQA and agent evaluation components further enhance the dataset's utility by enabling interactive and evaluative capabilities. The VQA component includes a set of questions and answers related to agricultural scenarios, which can be used to test and improve the reasoning capabilities of AI models. The agent evaluation component, meanwhile, assesses the performance of decision-making agents in simulated agricultural environments, providing insights into their effectiveness and reliability. Together, these components form a comprehensive foundation for developing and refining next-generation agricultural AI systems, ultimately leading to more informed and efficient decision-making in agriculture [5].

## 3.3 Optimization and Compression

### 3.3.1 Adaptive Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization for Capacity Planning
Adaptive Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (AMBO) is a sophisticated approach designed to address the complexities of capacity planning in systems with multiple, often conflicting, objectives. Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed parameters or manual tuning, AMBO dynamically adjusts its optimization strategy based on the evolving landscape of the problem. This adaptability is crucial in scenarios where the objectives, such as cost, performance, and sustainability, may change over time due to external factors or internal policy shifts. The core of AMBO lies in its ability to construct a Pareto front that represents a diverse set of optimal solutions, allowing decision-makers to explore a range of trade-offs without the need for re-optimization from scratch.

The AMBO algorithm integrates Bayesian optimization with multi-objective optimization techniques, leveraging probabilistic models to efficiently explore the solution space. By using Gaussian processes to model the objective functions, AMBO can handle the uncertainty and noise inherent in real-world data, making it particularly suitable for capacity planning in dynamic environments. The algorithm iteratively refines its model by selecting the most informative points to evaluate, thereby reducing the number of required evaluations and improving computational efficiency. This sample-efficient approach is especially valuable in scenarios where each evaluation is costly or time-consuming, such as in the deployment of large-scale energy systems or the allocation of resources in cloud computing environments.

To enhance the robustness and applicability of AMBO, the method incorporates a noise-model based approach that accounts for the variability and potential errors in the data. This is achieved by estimating the noise levels in the objective functions and adjusting the exploration-exploitation balance accordingly. The result is a more reliable and accurate Pareto front that can guide decision-makers in making informed choices. Additionally, AMBO eliminates the need for predetermined parameters, which can introduce bias and limit the diversity of solutions. By providing a flexible and adaptive framework, AMBO not only improves the quality of capacity planning but also facilitates the integration of new objectives and constraints as they arise, making it a powerful tool for modern, dynamic systems.

### 3.3.2 Compression Error Theory for Optimal Model Compression
Compression Error Theory (CET) provides a foundational framework for understanding and optimizing the trade-offs between model compression and performance degradation [6]. CET begins by establishing a theoretical basis for quantifying the impact of compression on model parameters and the resultant performance loss. This involves defining a compression error metric that captures the deviation of compressed parameters from their original values and relating this deviation to the model's output error. By leveraging total differentiation, CET can express the relationship between quantization-induced parameter errors and the corresponding performance loss, allowing for a systematic derivation of the optimal compression configuration [6].

The CET framework is designed to be agnostic to specific compression techniques, making it broadly applicable across various model architectures and compression methods. For instance, when applied to quantization, CET first identifies the critical parameters that contribute most significantly to the model's performance. It then uses algebraic methods to derive the optimal quantization levels that minimize the overall error while achieving the desired compression ratio. This approach ensures that the compression process does not disproportionately affect the model's ability to generalize and perform well on unseen data. Moreover, CET can be extended to other compression techniques, such as pruning and low-rank factorization, by adapting the error metrics and optimization criteria accordingly.

In practice, CET facilitates the development of mixed compression strategies that tailor the compression level to the specific characteristics of each layer in the model. Since different layers exhibit varying degrees of sensitivity to compression, layer-wise optimization can significantly enhance the compression rate while maintaining or even improving the model's performance [6]. By integrating CET with advanced optimization algorithms, such as gradient-based methods and evolutionary algorithms, it is possible to automate the process of finding the optimal compression configuration. This not only simplifies the model compression workflow but also ensures that the resulting models are highly efficient and effective in real-world applications.

### 3.3.3 Federated Continual Learning with Dynamic Allocation and Adaptive Recalibration
In the realm of federated continual learning (FCL), the challenge of managing dynamic and asynchronous tasks across multiple clients is paramount [7]. Traditional federated learning (FL) approaches, which assume static and homogeneous data distributions, are inadequate in this setting. To address these limitations, recent advancements have introduced methods that incorporate dynamic allocation and adaptive recalibration mechanisms. The dynamic allocation hypernetwork, a key component of this framework, is designed to maintain mappings between task identities and model weights, thereby preserving knowledge and mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting [7]. This hypernetwork dynamically adjusts the allocation of model parameters to new tasks, ensuring that the model can adapt to evolving data distributions without losing previously learned information [7].

The adaptive model recalibration mechanism further enhances the capabilities of FCL by introducing a calibration process based on contrastive similarity. This process evaluates the similarity between the current task and previously learned tasks, allowing the model to recalibrate its parameters in a way that optimizes performance on the new task while retaining relevant knowledge from past tasks. This adaptive recalibration is crucial in environments where tasks are not only dynamic but also asynchronous, meaning that different clients may encounter different tasks at different times. By leveraging contrastive learning, the model can effectively identify and leverage the most relevant past knowledge, even when the task distribution is highly variable.

Overall, the combination of dynamic allocation and adaptive recalibration in FCL provides a robust solution for handling the complexities of asynchronous and evolving tasks in a federated setting. These mechanisms not only enhance the model's ability to learn from new data but also ensure that the learning process is efficient and scalable. This approach represents a significant advancement in the field of federated learning, particularly in scenarios where clients operate in highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments, such as mobile devices or edge computing systems.

# 4 Environmental and Sustainability Assessments

## 4.1 Policy and Social Media Analytics

### 4.1.1 Large Language Models in Climate Change Policy Deliberation
Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in the realm of climate change policy deliberation, offering unprecedented capabilities for analyzing vast amounts of textual data and generating insights that can inform decision-making processes. These models, characterized by their ability to understand and generate human-like text, have been increasingly utilized to process complex and diverse data sources, including scientific reports, policy documents, and public discourse. By leveraging their advanced natural language processing capabilities, LLMs can help policymakers identify key trends, assess public sentiment, and evaluate the potential impacts of different policy options. For instance, LLMs can analyze the language used in climate change discussions on social media platforms to gauge public opinion and sentiment, providing valuable feedback that can be incorporated into policy development.

Moreover, LLMs can play a crucial role in the synthesis and summarization of scientific literature, which is essential for evidence-based policy-making. The vast amount of research on climate change, ranging from the physical sciences to socio-economic impacts, can be overwhelming for policymakers to navigate. LLMs can assist by summarizing key findings, identifying gaps in the literature, and highlighting areas of consensus and disagreement among experts. This not only streamlines the information-gathering process but also ensures that policymakers have access to the most up-to-date and relevant scientific insights. Additionally, LLMs can help in the development of policy scenarios by simulating the potential outcomes of different policy interventions, thereby aiding in risk assessment and strategic planning.

However, the integration of LLMs into climate change policy deliberation also presents several challenges and ethical considerations. The accuracy and reliability of the insights generated by LLMs depend heavily on the quality and representativeness of the data they are trained on. Biases in the training data can lead to biased outputs, which may skew policy recommendations. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the data used to train LLMs is diverse and inclusive, reflecting a wide range of perspectives and voices. Furthermore, the interpretability of LLMs remains a significant concern, as the complex algorithms underlying these models can make it difficult to understand how specific insights are derived. Addressing these challenges will be essential for maximizing the benefits of LLMs in climate change policy deliberation while minimizing potential risks.

### 4.1.2 Social Media Analytics for Sustainability Trend Detection
Social media analytics has emerged as a powerful tool for detecting and analyzing trends related to sustainability. By leveraging platforms such as X, Facebook, Instagram, and Google News, researchers can gather vast amounts of data reflecting public opinions, behaviors, and sentiments. The initial step in this process involves data collection, followed by data cleaning to remove irrelevant or redundant information. Posts are then filtered based on sustainability-related keywords and themes, ensuring that the dataset is focused on relevant discussions [8].

Once the data is cleaned and filtered, advanced clustering techniques are employed to group similar posts together, facilitating a deeper understanding of the various discussions and narratives surrounding sustainability [8]. These clusters can reveal distinct communities of users who share common concerns or perspectives, such as those focused on renewable energy, waste reduction, or corporate responsibility. By analyzing the content within these clusters, researchers can identify emerging trends, shifts in public opinion, and the effectiveness of specific sustainability initiatives.

The insights gained from social media analytics can inform policy makers, businesses, and organizations about the public's perceptions and expectations regarding sustainability. For instance, the analysis might highlight growing concerns about plastic waste or increasing support for electric vehicles. Over time, tracking these trends can help stakeholders adapt their strategies and communications to better align with public sentiment. Additionally, the temporal analysis of social media data can provide valuable insights into the impact of specific events, campaigns, or policies on public engagement and awareness.

### 4.1.3 Stakeholder Engagement and Feasibility Studies for Future Projects
Stakeholder engagement is a critical component in the development and implementation of future projects, particularly in the context of promoting circular economy (CE) and sustainability. Effective stakeholder engagement ensures that the perspectives, needs, and concerns of all relevant parties are considered, thereby enhancing the robustness and acceptability of project outcomes. In the construction industry, where the integration of circular practices is still nascent, stakeholder engagement can play a pivotal role in overcoming barriers such as lack of awareness, resistance to change, and regulatory hurdles. Engaging a diverse range of stakeholders, including policymakers, industry leaders, environmental organizations, and local communities, can facilitate the co-creation of solutions that are both technically feasible and socially acceptable.

Feasibility studies are another essential element in the planning and execution of future projects aimed at advancing CE and sustainability. These studies typically involve a comprehensive assessment of technical, economic, environmental, and social factors to determine the viability of proposed initiatives. In the context of construction, feasibility studies can help identify the most suitable materials, technologies, and practices that align with CE principles while ensuring cost-effectiveness and regulatory compliance. For instance, assessing the availability and cost of recycled materials, the energy efficiency of construction methods, and the potential environmental impacts of different design choices can inform decision-making processes and guide the development of more sustainable and circular construction projects. Moreover, integrating probabilistic analysis into feasibility studies can help account for uncertainties and risks, providing a more robust basis for project planning and resource allocation.

Ultimately, the success of future projects in promoting CE and sustainability hinges on the seamless integration of stakeholder engagement and rigorous feasibility studies. By fostering collaborative relationships and leveraging data-driven insights, project developers can navigate complex challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. For example, involving stakeholders in the early stages of project design can help identify potential barriers and co-develop strategies to mitigate them, leading to more resilient and adaptive projects. Similarly, conducting thorough feasibility studies can highlight the trade-offs and synergies between different aspects of sustainability, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions that balance economic, environmental, and social objectives. Together, these approaches can contribute to the creation of a more sustainable and circular construction industry, paving the way for a greener and more resilient built environment.

## 4.2 Material and Resource Analysis

### 4.2.1 Mechanical Testing and Simulation for Martian Concrete
Mechanical testing and simulation play a pivotal role in assessing the viability of Martian concrete as a construction material for future missions to Mars. The unique environmental conditions on Mars, characterized by low gravity, extreme temperature fluctuations, and a thin atmosphere, necessitate a thorough understanding of the mechanical properties of Martian concrete. To this end, researchers have conducted extensive mechanical tests to evaluate the compressive, tensile, and flexural strengths of Martian concrete. These tests often involve the use of simulated Martian regolith, which closely mimics the physical and chemical properties of the Martian soil. The results of these tests have revealed that Martian concrete exhibits significantly higher strengths compared to conventional concrete, primarily due to the unique composition of the Martian regolith and the use of sulfur as a binding agent [9].

Chemical analysis of Martian concrete has provided insights into the mechanisms responsible for its enhanced mechanical properties [9]. The Martian regolith, rich in iron and other metallic elements, reacts with sulfur to form stable polysulfide compounds, which contribute to the overall strength and durability of the concrete. Additionally, the particle size distribution of the Martian regolith is more favorable for achieving a dense and uniform matrix, further enhancing the mechanical properties of the concrete. These findings have been corroborated through advanced simulation techniques, such as the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM), which allows for the precise modeling of the microstructural behavior of Martian concrete under various loading conditions [9]. The LDPM simulations have been particularly useful in predicting the fracture behavior and deformation characteristics of Martian concrete, providing valuable data for the design of Martian infrastructure.

To further validate the mechanical performance of Martian concrete, researchers have also conducted simulations to assess its behavior under the specific conditions of the Martian environment. These simulations take into account factors such as the reduced gravity, thermal cycling, and radiation exposure that Martian structures would experience. The results of these simulations have shown that Martian concrete maintains its integrity and performance under these challenging conditions, making it a promising material for the construction of habitats, landing pads, and other critical infrastructure on Mars. The integration of mechanical testing and simulation has thus provided a comprehensive framework for evaluating the suitability of Martian concrete, paving the way for its potential use in future Mars missions.

### 4.2.2 Life Cycle Assessment for Virgin Aggregate Production
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a comprehensive methodology used to evaluate the environmental impacts of products and processes, including virgin aggregate production. The primary goal of LCA in this context is to quantify the environmental burdens associated with the extraction, processing, transportation, and use of aggregates. According to ISO 14040, the LCA process involves four main stages: goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpretation. In the context of virgin aggregate production, the goal and scope definition stage is crucial for establishing the boundaries of the study, identifying the functional unit, and defining the system boundaries. For instance, the functional unit might be defined as one tonne of crushed stone, and the system boundaries could include all processes from quarrying to the delivery site.

During the inventory analysis stage, data are collected on all inputs and outputs of the aggregate production process, including energy consumption, material usage, emissions, and waste generation. This stage often reveals significant variations in environmental impacts depending on the specific characteristics of the quarry, such as the type of rock, the distance to the processing plant, and the mode of transportation. For example, quarries located closer to urban centers may have lower transportation-related emissions but higher noise and dust pollution impacts. The impact assessment stage then translates these inventory data into environmental impact categories, such as global warming potential, acidification, eutrophication, and resource depletion. Advanced LCA models may also consider social and economic impacts, providing a more holistic view of the aggregate production process.

Finally, the interpretation stage involves analyzing the results to identify hotspots and opportunities for improvement. This stage often highlights the importance of optimizing energy use and reducing emissions in the quarrying and processing phases. For instance, adopting more efficient crushing and screening technologies can significantly reduce energy consumption and emissions. Additionally, the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, can further mitigate the environmental footprint of aggregate production. Overall, LCA provides a robust framework for assessing and improving the sustainability of virgin aggregate production, aligning with broader circular economy principles.

### 4.2.3 Chemistry-Aware Battery Degradation Prediction
Chemistry-aware battery degradation prediction represents a significant advancement in the field of battery management systems, leveraging detailed chemical and physical properties to forecast the lifecycle and performance of batteries more accurately. This approach integrates fundamental principles from electrochemistry, materials science, and computational modeling to simulate the complex degradation mechanisms that occur within batteries. By understanding the specific chemical reactions, such as the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, lithium plating, and electrode material degradation, researchers can develop predictive models that account for the dynamic changes in battery chemistry over time.

These models often employ machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning techniques, to process large datasets of battery performance and chemical composition. The algorithms are trained on experimental data from a variety of battery types and operating conditions, allowing them to generalize and predict degradation patterns under different scenarios. For instance, by analyzing the rate of capacity fade and internal resistance increase, these models can estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of a battery with higher precision than traditional empirical models. This is crucial for applications in electric vehicles (EVs), where accurate RUL prediction can optimize maintenance schedules and reduce operational costs.

Moreover, chemistry-aware models can provide insights into the impact of specific materials and manufacturing processes on battery longevity. For example, the use of silicon-based anodes, which offer higher energy density but are prone to rapid degradation due to volume expansion, can be better managed with these predictive tools. By identifying the critical factors that influence degradation, such as electrolyte composition, temperature, and charging protocols, these models can guide the development of new battery designs and materials that enhance both performance and durability. This holistic approach not only improves the reliability of batteries but also supports the transition to more sustainable and efficient energy storage solutions.

## 4.3 Environmental Monitoring and Modeling

### 4.3.1 Mobile Monitoring for High-Resolution PM2.5 Pollution Maps
Mobile monitoring for high-resolution PM2.5 pollution maps has emerged as a critical tool in environmental science, leveraging the advancements in sensor technology and data analytics [10]. This approach integrates large-scale mobile monitoring data with fixed monitoring stations and urban characterization data to produce detailed, high-resolution maps of PM2.5 pollution [10]. The primary objective is to enhance the spatial and temporal resolution of pollution maps, which are essential for assessing individual health exposure and informing environmental policies. By deploying mobile sensors on vehicles, bicycles, or drones, researchers can collect continuous, real-time data over extensive urban areas, providing a more comprehensive understanding of pollution dynamics.

Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of mobile monitoring in generating high-resolution PM2.5 pollution maps [10]. For example, a study in a densely populated urban area utilized mobile monitoring to create a 2D gridded air pollution map, which was instrumental in exposure assessment studies. Another study integrated data from mobile low-cost sensor (LCS) monitoring with other sources to map the grid distribution of PM2.5 in a micro-scale walkable environment. These studies highlight the importance of dense observation in both temporal and spatial dimensions for constructing accurate pollution maps. The ability to track pollutant concentrations continuously over extended periods and across various spatial scales is crucial for identifying pollution hotspots and understanding the factors that influence air quality.

The integration of mobile monitoring with advanced data analytics techniques, such as machine learning and geostatistical models, further enhances the accuracy and reliability of high-resolution PM2.5 pollution maps. These techniques can account for the complex interactions between pollutant sources, meteorological conditions, and urban infrastructure, providing a more nuanced view of air pollution. Moreover, the data generated from mobile monitoring can be used to validate and refine existing air quality models, leading to more accurate predictions and better-informed decision-making. As the technology continues to evolve, the potential for mobile monitoring to revolutionize our understanding of urban air pollution and its impacts on public health is increasingly evident.

### 4.3.2 Probabilistic Grading and Classification for End-of-Life Buildings
Probabilistic grading and classification for end-of-life buildings represents a significant advancement in the circular economy (CE) framework within the construction sector. This approach leverages probabilistic models to assess the potential for recycling, reusing, and repurposing building materials, thereby addressing the inherent uncertainties associated with the lifecycle of buildings. By integrating statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, probabilistic grading can provide a more nuanced and accurate evaluation of a building's circularity, enabling better decision-making for deconstruction and material recovery. This method accounts for variables such as material quality, structural integrity, and market demand, which are often subject to significant variability and uncertainty.

The probabilistic framework for grading end-of-life buildings typically involves the use of Bayesian networks or Monte Carlo simulations to model the likelihood of different outcomes. These models can incorporate a wide range of input parameters, including the age of the building, the types of materials used, and the local recycling infrastructure. By simulating various scenarios, probabilistic grading can help stakeholders identify the most viable options for material recovery and reuse, optimizing the overall circularity of the construction process. For instance, Bayesian networks can be used to predict the probability of successful material separation and recycling, while Monte Carlo simulations can estimate the economic benefits and environmental impacts of different deconstruction strategies.

Moreover, probabilistic classification systems can be integrated with advanced data analytics and remote sensing technologies to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the assessment process. For example, satellite imagery and LiDAR data can be used to create detailed 3D models of buildings, providing valuable insights into their structural characteristics and material composition. Machine learning algorithms can then classify buildings based on their potential for circularity, flagging those with high-value recoverable materials or those that pose significant challenges for deconstruction. This integration of probabilistic methods with modern data technologies not only improves the precision of circularity assessments but also supports the development of more sustainable and resilient urban environments.

### 4.3.3 Computational Model for Hydrogen Embrittlement in Steel Lining
The computational modeling of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in steel linings is a critical aspect of ensuring the long-term integrity and safety of structures used in hydrogen storage and transportation. Hydrogen embrittlement occurs when hydrogen atoms diffuse into the steel matrix, leading to a reduction in the material's ductility and tensile strength, ultimately compromising its structural performance. The modeling approach typically involves a combination of continuum mechanics, diffusion theory, and fracture mechanics to predict the onset and propagation of HE. Key parameters in these models include the hydrogen concentration, diffusion coefficients, and the mechanical properties of the steel.

In the context of computational models, the hydrogen diffusion process is often described using Fick's laws of diffusion, which govern the movement of hydrogen atoms within the steel matrix. These models consider the chemical potential gradient as the driving force for hydrogen diffusion, and the diffusion coefficients are temperature-dependent, reflecting the activation energy required for hydrogen atoms to move through the lattice. Additionally, the interaction between hydrogen and dislocations, grain boundaries, and other microstructural features of the steel is crucial, as these interactions can significantly influence the diffusion process and the accumulation of hydrogen at critical sites within the material.

To simulate the effects of HE on the mechanical behavior of steel linings, advanced finite element (FE) models are employed, incorporating both the diffusion of hydrogen and the resulting changes in material properties. These FE models can predict the evolution of stress and strain fields in the presence of hydrogen, as well as the initiation and growth of cracks. By integrating these models with experimental data, researchers can validate the predictions and refine the computational parameters to better represent real-world conditions. This comprehensive approach is essential for developing design guidelines and safety protocols for hydrogen storage systems that utilize steel linings.

### 5.1.2 High-Frequency Financial Data and Policy Impact Analysis
High-frequency financial data (HFFD) plays a crucial role in the analysis of policy impacts, particularly in understanding the immediate and short-term reactions of financial markets to policy announcements. HFFD, characterized by its granular time intervals (ranging from milliseconds to minutes), provides a detailed view of market dynamics, enabling researchers to capture the nuanced effects of policy changes. This section explores how HFFD is utilized to assess the impact of various economic policies, focusing on methodologies that leverage this data to derive actionable insights.

One of the key methodologies employed in this context is the Local Projection (LP) technique, which is particularly well-suited for analyzing the dynamic responses of financial variables to policy shocks. LP involves estimating impulse response functions by regressing the future values of a variable of interest on current and lagged values of the policy shock. This approach allows for the examination of how financial markets react over different horizons, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the policy's temporal effects. For instance, in the context of monetary policy, LP can be used to assess how changes in interest rates influence asset prices, exchange rates, and credit spreads in the immediate aftermath of a policy announcement.

Moreover, the integration of machine learning algorithms with HFFD has opened new avenues for policy impact analysis. Techniques such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Neural Networks can handle the high dimensionality and non-linear relationships inherent in HFFD, offering more accurate predictions and deeper insights into market behavior. These models can identify complex patterns and interactions that traditional econometric methods might miss, thereby enhancing the robustness of policy evaluations. For example, machine learning can be used to predict the likelihood of market volatility following a policy announcement, helping policymakers to better anticipate and manage potential market reactions. Overall, the combination of HFFD and advanced analytical techniques provides a powerful toolkit for understanding the intricate relationship between policy actions and financial market outcomes.

### 5.1.3 Research through Design for User-Centered AI Solutions
Research through Design (RtD) has emerged as a pivotal methodological approach in the development of user-centered AI solutions, emphasizing the iterative and participatory nature of design to address complex user needs and challenges [11]. In the context of AI, RtD involves the creation and evaluation of design artifacts that serve both as means of inquiry and as outcomes of the research process. By engaging with end-users throughout the design cycle, researchers can gain deep insights into the practical and emotional dimensions of AI interactions, leading to more intuitive and effective solutions. For instance, in the development of conversational AI systems, RtD allows designers to explore how users construct and interact with chatbots for emotional support, identifying key features such as the ability to manage past conversations and integrate community support [11].

The RtD approach in AI design is characterized by its focus on co-creation and prototyping, enabling researchers to test and refine design solutions in real-world settings. This method is particularly valuable in uncovering the nuanced ways in which users engage with AI technologies, such as their preferences for personalization, privacy controls, and the integration of AI into their daily routines. Through iterative cycles of design, deployment, and feedback, RtD facilitates the identification of unmet user needs and the development of innovative solutions that enhance user experience. For example, in the context of digital twins for supply chain management, RtD can help identify the specific data visualizations and predictive analytics that are most useful to stakeholders, leading to more actionable insights and better decision-making.

Moreover, RtD in AI research emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations and user empowerment. By involving users in the design process, researchers can ensure that AI solutions are not only technically sound but also aligned with users' values and ethical standards. This is particularly crucial in areas such as data cooperatives, where the principles of transparency, fairness, and user control are paramount [12]. Through RtD, designers can develop AI systems that not only meet functional requirements but also foster trust and promote positive social outcomes, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive and equitable technological landscape.

## 5.2 Interdisciplinary Perspectives and Empirical Analysis

### 5.2.1 Ecofeminist and Decolonial Perspectives on Data and AI
Ecofeminist and decolonial perspectives on data and AI challenge the dominant narratives and practices within the tech industry, emphasizing the interconnectedness of environmental degradation, social injustice, and technological development [13]. These perspectives highlight how the current data-driven and AI-centric models often perpetuate colonial and patriarchal structures, leading to the exploitation of both natural resources and marginalized communities. By critiquing the extractive nature of big data and AI, ecofeminist and decolonial scholars advocate for a more equitable and sustainable approach to technology that recognizes the interdependence of humans, nature, and technology [13].

One of the key arguments within these perspectives is the need to decolonize data and AI by rethinking the ownership, control, and governance of data [12]. This involves challenging the dominance of large tech corporations and their often opaque and centralized data practices, which can lead to the disempowerment of local communities and the loss of data sovereignty. Ecofeminist and decolonial approaches emphasize the importance of community-driven data governance, where data is managed and used in ways that benefit the community and respect local knowledge and cultural practices. This includes the development of data cooperatives and other decentralized models that allow for more democratic and participatory decision-making processes [12].

Furthermore, these perspectives call for a reevaluation of the ethical and social implications of AI technologies, particularly in terms of their impact on marginalized groups. This involves addressing issues such as algorithmic bias, surveillance, and the potential for AI to reinforce existing power imbalances. Ecofeminist and decolonial scholars argue for the development of AI systems that are transparent, accountable, and designed to promote social justice and environmental sustainability. This includes the integration of Indigenous and local knowledge systems into AI design and the promotion of pluriversal epistemologies that recognize multiple ways of knowing and being in the world. By doing so, these perspectives aim to create a more inclusive and equitable technological landscape that respects the diversity of human experiences and the natural world.

### 5.2.2 Empirical Analysis of Decentralized Federated Learning
Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a promising approach to address the limitations of centralized Federated Learning (FL) by eliminating the need for a central server and enabling more flexible and scalable network topologies [14]. In DFL, each node in the network participates in the training process by locally updating its model and then exchanging these updates with its neighbors [14]. This decentralized architecture not only mitigates the risks associated with a single point of failure but also enhances the robustness of the system against data breaches and communication bottlenecks. Empirical studies have shown that DFL can achieve comparable or even superior performance to centralized FL in various scenarios, particularly in settings with non-iid data distributions and limited communication bandwidth.

The empirical analysis of DFL has focused on several key aspects, including convergence properties, communication efficiency, and robustness to node failures. Convergence analysis has revealed that DFL algorithms can converge to a global optimum under certain conditions, such as convex loss functions and appropriate learning rates. However, the convergence rate can be slower compared to centralized FL due to the increased complexity of model aggregation in a decentralized setting. To address this, researchers have proposed various optimization techniques, such as momentum-based methods and adaptive learning rate strategies, to accelerate convergence. Communication efficiency is another critical factor, as DFL relies on frequent model exchanges between nodes. Studies have explored the impact of different communication topologies, such as fully connected, ring, and tree structures, on the overall performance and resource consumption of DFL systems.

Robustness to node failures and adversarial attacks is a significant advantage of DFL, as the absence of a central server reduces the attack surface and the impact of a single node's failure on the entire system [14]. Empirical evaluations have demonstrated that DFL can maintain its performance even when a certain percentage of nodes are compromised or fail to participate in the training process. This resilience is particularly valuable in real-world applications where network conditions can be unpredictable and node availability may vary over time. However, the trade-offs between robustness and efficiency remain a topic of ongoing research, with efforts to develop more sophisticated algorithms that can balance these competing requirements while ensuring high performance and security in decentralized federated learning environments.

### 5.2.3 Energy Consumption Comparison in Web Agents
In the realm of web agents, energy consumption has emerged as a critical metric alongside traditional performance indicators such as speed and accuracy [15]. This section delves into the comparative analysis of energy consumption across different web agents, highlighting the methodologies and metrics used to evaluate their environmental impact [15]. The primary focus is on two prominent web agents: MindAct, which leverages open-source large language models (LLMs) and advanced preprocessing techniques to minimize energy usage, and LASER, a state-of-the-art agent known for its high performance but often at the cost of higher energy consumption. By quantifying the energy consumption of these agents, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the trade-offs involved in their design and operation.

The evaluation of energy consumption in web agents involves a multi-faceted approach, incorporating both direct measurements and simulation-based assessments [15]. Direct measurements typically involve monitoring the power draw of the hardware on which the web agents run, using tools such as power meters and energy profiling software. Simulation-based assessments, on the other hand, rely on models that estimate energy consumption based on the computational complexity of the tasks performed by the web agents. These simulations can account for various factors, including the efficiency of the underlying algorithms, the size of the datasets processed, and the frequency of model updates. The results from these evaluations are crucial for understanding the energy efficiency of different web agents and for identifying areas where improvements can be made.

Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences in energy consumption between MindAct and LASER. MindAct, with its focus on open-source LLMs and smart preprocessing, demonstrates a markedly lower energy footprint, consuming approximately 30% less energy than LASER for equivalent tasks. This reduction is attributed to several factors, including the use of more energy-efficient algorithms, optimized data preprocessing techniques, and a modular architecture that allows for dynamic resource allocation. In contrast, LASER's higher energy consumption is primarily due to its reliance on proprietary, high-performance models and a more resource-intensive training process. These findings underscore the importance of energy efficiency in the design of web agents and highlight the need for continued research into sustainable computing practices in the field of artificial intelligence.

## 5.3 Frameworks and Models for Sustainability

### 5.3.1 Data Cooperatives for Collective Data Management
Data cooperatives represent a novel approach to collective data management, designed to address the growing concerns over data privacy, transparency, and equitable value distribution in the digital economy [12]. Unlike traditional data management models where large corporations often centralize and commoditize personal data, data cooperatives empower individuals to collectively manage and benefit from their data [12]. These cooperatives are structured on the principles of cooperative enterprises, where members have democratic oversight over data usage and share in the value generated from data exploitation. This model not only enhances data sovereignty but also fosters a more equitable and transparent data ecosystem.

The operational framework of data cooperatives is built on four key components: governance, data management, benefit distribution, and technological infrastructure [12]. Governance structures ensure that decision-making processes are inclusive and transparent, often leveraging blockchain technology to facilitate secure and decentralized voting mechanisms. Data management involves the collection, storage, and sharing of data in a way that maintains privacy and security, with advanced encryption and access control mechanisms. Benefit distribution models are designed to ensure that the economic value derived from data is shared fairly among members, often through token-based reward systems. The technological infrastructure of data cooperatives typically includes decentralized platforms and smart contracts to automate and enforce the cooperative’s rules and operations.

Despite their potential, data cooperatives face several challenges that must be addressed for widespread adoption. These include ensuring high levels of user engagement and participation in governance processes, developing robust technical solutions to manage large volumes of data securely and efficiently, and navigating regulatory and legal frameworks that vary across jurisdictions. Additionally, there is a need for clear and transparent communication about the benefits and risks associated with data cooperatives to build trust among potential members. Addressing these challenges will be crucial in realizing the full potential of data cooperatives as a transformative model for collective data management.

### 5.3.2 Key Performance Indicators for DAO Governance
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are essential for assessing the effectiveness and sustainability of their governance structures [16]. These KPIs encompass a wide range of metrics that reflect the social, economic, and procedural dimensions of DAO operations. Social KPIs, for instance, include metrics such as user engagement, community participation, and decision-making transparency. High levels of user engagement and active community participation are crucial for the long-term viability of a DAO, as they ensure that the organization remains decentralized and responsive to the needs and preferences of its members. Economic KPIs, on the other hand, focus on financial stability, token value, and the distribution of resources within the DAO. These metrics help to evaluate the financial health and sustainability of the organization, ensuring that it can continue to operate and grow over time.

Procedural KPIs are equally important, as they measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the governance processes within a DAO. These include metrics such as the speed of decision-making, the frequency of governance proposals, and the success rate of implemented changes. Efficient and transparent governance processes are vital for maintaining trust and confidence among DAO members, as well as for attracting new participants and investors. Additionally, KPIs related to technological infrastructure, such as network uptime, transaction throughput, and security, are critical for ensuring the reliability and resilience of the DAO. By monitoring these KPIs, DAOs can identify areas for improvement and implement strategies to enhance their overall performance and sustainability.

The application of these KPIs to real-world DAOs reveals several governance issues and informs strategies for improvement [16]. For example, low levels of user engagement and community participation may indicate a need for more inclusive and participatory governance mechanisms, such as quadratic voting or liquid democracy. Similarly, economic KPIs that show a decline in token value or uneven resource distribution can signal underlying issues with the DAO's financial model or incentive structures. Addressing these issues through targeted interventions, such as adjusting tokenomics or implementing more equitable reward systems, can help to improve the financial sustainability of the DAO. Ultimately, the systematic use of KPIs provides a structured approach for evaluating and enhancing the governance of DAOs, ensuring that they remain robust, adaptable, and aligned with the goals and values of their communities [16].

### 5.3.3 Graph Neural Networks and Digital Twins for Supply Chain Optimization
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged as powerful tools for optimizing supply chain management, addressing critical issues such as data fragmentation, scalability, and real-time decision-making [17]. GNNs, with their ability to model complex relationships and dependencies, are particularly well-suited for supply chain networks, where entities such as suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors are interconnected. By representing these entities and their interactions as nodes and edges in a graph, GNNs can effectively capture and analyze the intricate dynamics of supply chains [17]. This graph-based approach allows for the identification of bottlenecks, prediction of disruptions, and optimization of resource allocation, thereby enhancing overall supply chain efficiency and resilience.

The integration of GNNs with DTs further amplifies the potential for supply chain optimization. DTs are virtual replicas of physical systems that can simulate and predict the behavior of supply chains in real-time. When combined with GNNs, DTs can dynamically update their models based on continuous data streams from various sources, such as IoT sensors, market trends, and production updates. This real-time data integration enables DTs to provide accurate and up-to-date insights, facilitating proactive decision-making and risk mitigation. For instance, a DT powered by GNNs can predict potential supply chain disruptions by analyzing patterns in historical data and current market conditions, allowing managers to take preemptive actions to avoid or minimize the impact of these disruptions.

Moreover, the use of GNNs and DTs in supply chain management supports sustainable practices by optimizing resource utilization and reducing waste. The ability to simulate different scenarios and evaluate their environmental impact allows organizations to adopt more sustainable strategies, such as reducing carbon emissions and minimizing resource consumption. Additionally, the scalability of GNNs and DTs makes them applicable to both small and large supply chains, ensuring that the benefits of these technologies can be realized across various industry sectors. Overall, the combination of GNNs and DTs represents a promising approach to addressing the complex challenges of modern supply chain management, driving both operational efficiency and sustainability [17].
