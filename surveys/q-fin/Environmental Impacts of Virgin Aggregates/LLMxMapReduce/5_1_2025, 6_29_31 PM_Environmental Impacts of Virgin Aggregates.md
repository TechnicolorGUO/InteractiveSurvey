# 0. Environmental Impacts of Virgin Aggregates  

# 1. Introduction  

The global construction and infrastructure sectors are characterized by an extensive reliance on virgin aggregates, sourced primarily through quarrying and surface mining operations [25]. This dependence results in a significant scale of aggregate consumption annually, driven by factors such as urbanization and industrialization [11,13]. While precise global consumption figures vary, the scale is substantial, with a large proportion of demand met by quarrying rock due to the limited availability of natural sand and gravel resources [25]. The building sector alone is a considerable consumer of natural resources, including stone aggregate [13]. The increasing demand for these natural resources, particularly natural sand, highlights growing concerns about resource depletion [11,17].​  

The extraction and processing of virgin aggregates are associated with significant environmental impacts across multiple domains. Land degradation constitutes a major concern, altering land use/land cover and diminishing landscape multifunctionality, with disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations [18]. In regions like India, 120.7 M ha are affected by land degradation, often exacerbated by factors such as soil erosion [15]. Biodiversity loss is another critical consequence, stemming from habitat destruction, fragmentation, and modification inherent in mining and quarrying activities [7,20]. For example, deep-sea mining, analogous in principle to terrestrial extraction, directly removes organisms and disrupts complex, sensitive ecosystems, leading to potential long-term biodiversity loss due to slow recovery rates [7]. Surface extraction can also lead to soil pollution and disruption of aquatic ecosystems, as seen in cases of improper waste disposal [8].​  

Furthermore, the aggregates industry contributes to atmospheric impacts, notably through carbon emissions associated with extraction, processing, and transportation. The industrial sector, encompassing aggregate production, accounts for approximately $2 8 \%$ of global greenhouse gas emissions [2], and the mineral products industry specifically recognizes the importance of reducing its carbon footprint [26]. The building sector's energy consumption from fossil fuels also contributes significantly to global carbon emissions [13]. These emissions contribute to rising global temperatures and disrupted ecosystems, driving climate change concerns [14]. The cumulative nature of these environmental hazards can also disproportionately affect certain communities, raising environmental justice concerns [28].  

Given the extensive environmental damage potential [4] and the global imperative to mitigate climate change and achieve sustainability goals such as those outlined in the Paris Agreement and European Union targets for carbon neutrality [1,2], there is an urgent need for fundamental changes in how aggregates are sourced and utilized.

This survey aims to address this critical need by providing a comprehensive overview of the environmental impacts associated with the use of virgin aggregates [13]. By synthesizing findings from existing research, this review seeks to evaluate the scale and nature of these impacts and explore potential sustainable alternatives and practices being developed, such as the use of recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste or alternative materials like mollusk shells [8,11,17]. The objective is to inform researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders, thereby promoting more sustainable approaches within the construction sector [13].​  

# 2. Overview of Virgin Aggregate Use, Extraction, and Processing  

The substantial global demand for virgin aggregates, primarily driven by the construction sector, necessitates extensive extraction and processing activities [13]. These processes are foundational to the supply chain of construction materials like concrete, where aggregates (sand and stone) constitute a significant volume fraction, as illustrated by a typical 1:2:4 concrete mix requiring 0.445 $m ^ { 3 }$ of coarse sand, $0 . 2 2 \ m ^ { 3 }$ of $1 0 \mathsf { m m }$ stone aggregate, and 0.67 $m ^ { 3 }$ of $2 0 ~ \mathsf { m m }$ stone aggregate per cubic meter of concrete [13]. The magnitude of aggregate use is intrinsically linked to the scale and methods of their extraction and subsequent processing.  

![](images/c0a0815123446a88723b3847aa761f0d46e733080f0911ab389ee28f293e0de1.jpg)  

Virgin aggregates are primarily sourced through various extraction methods, including surface mining techniques such as open-pit mining and quarrying, as well as dredging. Open-pit mining is widely applied for extracting large mineral deposits like copper, gold, and iron ore, among others [25]. While often associated with metallic ores, large open cast operations are characterized by significant overburden removal, sometimes generating up to 16 tonnes of overburden per tonne of ore rock mined, though lower ratios are often targeted [9]. In contrast, quarrying specifically targets rock for construction materials, such as dimension stone or crushed rock used for aggregates, and raw materials for cement [24,25]. A key distinction lies in waste generation: open-pit mining processes a large volume of removed material, much of which is discarded as tailings, whereas quarrying primarily processes the target rock itself, resulting in comparatively less waste in the initial extraction phase [25]. Dredging involves extracting aggregates like gravel and sand from aquatic environments, including marine areas [12].​  

Each extraction method has distinct initial environmental implications. Open-pit mining, particularly large-scale operations, causes significant disruption to ecosystems through direct land occupation and indirect impacts, leading to habitat loss and degradation and a reduction in ecosystem service values [27]. Quarrying also profoundly alters landscapes. Methods like blasting, commonly used in quarry operations, result in fragmented surfaces, rugged landforms, unstable cliffs, and abandoned pits and ponds [6,23]. Sites often feature exposed soil and rocks, dilapidated infrastructure, and discarded equipment [6,23]. Dredging in marine environments directly modifies the seabed, causing habitat loss, degradation, and disturbance to marine ecosystems [12].​  

Following extraction, aggregates undergo processing stages, typically including crushing, screening, and sometimes washing. Crushing and grinding are necessary to reduce the extracted rock or gravel to desired particle sizes, often ranging from 10 to ${ 1 , 0 0 0 \mu \mathsf { m } }$ , creating a large reactive surface area [9]. Screening separates particles by size, while washing removes fine materials and impurities. These processing stages contribute significantly to environmental impacts. A major byproduct is mine tailings, which are the uneconomic materials remaining after processing, often ground to clay-silt to sand-sized particles [9]. Tailings are mixed with water and process effluents to form slurries, requiring specialized containment facilities [9]. For every tonne of ore mined, a substantial proportion $6 0 \%$ to over $9 9 \%$ ) can become mine tailings [9]. Environmental implications include potential water pollution from process water and slurries containing fine particles and residual chemicals, air pollution from dust generated during crushing and screening, and land use for vast tailings storage facilities [9]. Thus, the entire process, from the initial extraction method's land disturbance and habitat impacts to the waste generation and pollution potential of processing, underpins the environmental footprint of virgin aggregate production.  

# 3. Environmental Impacts of Virgin Aggregates  

![](images/ca7b2e45a08918114a16d8dd5a4bc456d4f72c4dc46028bb6a1369c45546d703.jpg)  

The extraction and processing of virgin aggregates impose substantial and multifaceted environmental consequences across various environmental compartments, including land, water, air, and ecosystems [5,13]. This systematic analysis categorizes these impacts, discusses their severity and extent, explores their interdependencies, and considers the concept of critical thresholds and cumulative effects. Underlying these impacts is the inherent challenge of resource depletion, as aggregates are finite, non-renewable resources consumed at increasing rates driven by development needs [7,11]. The sheer scale of extraction activities, evidenced by vast excavations and widespread historical traces, highlights the significant pressure placed on natural resource stocks and landscapes [6,23].  

Impacts on land are profound, commencing with direct land degradation, habitat destruction, and fundamental alteration of natural landscapes through the removal of overlying soil and vegetation [6,13,23]. This exposure leads to accelerated soil erosion, a severe consequence amplified by the loss of protective vegetative cover and altered drainage patterns [13,15,16]. Erosion rates increase dramatically without vegetation, which otherwise acts to reduce runoff and shear stress [16]. Land degradation also entails a loss of ecological and economic resilience, impacting the capacity of land systems to adapt [18].  

Quantifying the global extent of land degradation solely attributable to aggregate extraction remains challenging based on available data.  

Water resources are significantly impacted through the introduction of pollutants such as sediment, chemicals, and heavy metals via surface runoff, discharge of process water, and exacerbated soil erosion [5,13,15,23]. These inputs degrade both surface water quality, leading to increased turbidity and altered chemical composition, and potentially groundwater quality through seepage [5,6,13]. Furthermore, aggregate extraction, including deep-sea mining, causes hydrological alterations by modifying landscapes, changing runoff characteristics, and altering streamflow patterns [7,13,23]. The water-intensive nature of processing steps like washing aggregates further strains local water resources [13].​  

Air and noise pollution are direct consequences of extraction and processing operations. Airborne pollutants include dust, particulate matter, and emissions from heavy machinery [5,13]. The decomposition of certain waste materials used as alternative aggregates can also release noxious gases [8]. These pollutants pose health risks to workers and nearby communities, with fine particulate matter and diesel emissions linked to respiratory issues and cancer risk [28]. Excessive noise from equipment and blasting also impacts human health and wildlife [5,13]. While monitoring is essential, comprehensive data on the effectiveness of specific dust and noise control technologies in this context are not widely detailed in the provided literature.​  

The extraction process contributes to the carbon footprint through energy consumption for machinery, processing (including high-temperature heat in related industries), and transportation [2,13]. Transportation distances and modes significantly influence total carbon emissions, highlighting potential benefits of locally sourced recycled materials [11,26]. Utilizing recycled or waste-derived aggregates offers a lower carbon footprint compared to virgin materials [8,11]. Improving energy efficiency and adopting renewable energy sources are recognized strategies for reducing emissions [2,26].​  

Biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption are significant environmental impacts, driven fundamentally by the physical destruction, loss, fragmentation, and modification of habitats across terrestrial, marine, deep-sea, and wetland environments [6,7,13,20,23]. This directly impacts biota and disrupts ecological processes necessary for ecosystem function, affecting species populations, including vulnerable species [7,20]. The loss of biodiversity diminishes the capacity of ecosystems to provide essential services, such as climate regulation and water purification [18,27]. Metrics like Mean Species Abundance and Gross Ecosystem Product valuation demonstrate the decline in ecological value associated with mining activities [10,27]. Certain ecosystems, particularly deep-sea environments, are highly vulnerable due to unique characteristics and slow recovery rates [7].​  

The environmental impacts are rarely isolated, exhibiting significant interdependencies. Land degradation and vegetation removal directly lead to increased soil erosion [15,16]. This erosion, in turn, contributes substantially to water pollution through sediment and associated contaminants entering waterways, impacting aquatic habitats and water quality [13,15]. Habitat destruction, a primary land impact, directly causes biodiversity loss and disrupts ecosystem functions and the provision of ecosystem services across affected environments [7,20,27]. Resource depletion underlies the drive for extraction, intensifying these impacts.​  

Assessing the full scope necessitates considering cumulative and transboundary impacts. Aggregate extraction activities, like other resource uses, can exert pressures that cross political boundaries due to shared ecosystems and resources [21]. Cumulative environmental hazards can cluster geographically, and ecosystems often face multiple simultaneous pressures, exacerbating degradation [12,28]. Global consumption patterns contribute to transboundary environmental burdens, including biodiversity loss driven by resource extraction in distant regions [10]. The scale of indirect cumulative impacts is often unknown, posing significant challenges for prediction and management [7]. While mitigation and restoration efforts such as ecological red lines, wetland restoration, and abandoned quarry rehabilitation are undertaken [6,20,23], their longterm effectiveness in fully restoring complex ecosystems and preventing impacts from exceeding critical, potentially irreversible, thresholds requires continued evaluation and adaptive regulatory frameworks [5,7]. The identified environmental challenges underscore the need for transitioning towards sustainable alternatives and circular economy approaches to reduce reliance on virgin aggregate extraction [8,11].​  

# 3.1 Land Degradation and Habitat Loss  

Virgin aggregate extraction is a significant contributor to land degradation and the loss of valuable habitats, fundamentally altering natural landscapes [6,23]. The process inherently involves the removal of overlying soil and vegetation, directly  

leading to habitat destruction and exposure of barren surfaces [6,13,23]. This transformation results in broken terrain and altered topography, creating features such as high cliffs and degraded land surfaces [6].  

A primary consequence of vegetation and topsoil removal is accelerated soil erosion [13,15,16]. The mechanisms involve the loss of the protective vegetative cover and the alteration of natural drainage patterns, leaving soil vulnerable to wind and water erosion [13]. Research indicates that vegetation plays a critical role in mitigating soil erosion; its removal dramatically increases erosion rates [16]. Conversely, the strategic placement of vegetation, such as grass strips, can significantly reduce runoff erosion by up to $6 9 \%$ , increase runoff resistance by five times, and decrease runoff shear stress and power by over $9 0 \%$ [16]. This highlights the severity of erosion when protective vegetation is absent. At a larger scale, soil erosion affects vast areas, exemplified by the 85.7 million hectares of land impacted in India due to factors including deforestation and unsustainable practices that can be associated with land-use change for extraction [15]. Certain landscapes, such as those affected by deforestation or karst formations, are particularly vulnerable to land degradation resulting from such land-use transformations [18].  

The removal and modification of habitats represent a major threat to biodiversity [20]. In terrestrial environments, quarrying directly replaces natural habitats, leading to their loss and fragmentation [10,23]. For instance, illegal quarrying around the Tang imperial tombs in China resulted in approximately 10 stone pits occupying nearly 67 hectares around a single ancient tomb, causing serious damage to culturally significant landscapes and their associated ecology [24]. Similarly, extraction activities in marine environments, such as the harvesting of gravel and sand from the seabed, cause direct habitat removal, fragmentation, and modification, posing a major threat to marine ecosystems and their associated fauna [7,12]. Studies utilizing programs like the Finnish Inventory Programme for the Underwater Marine Environment (VELMU) document the impact of seabed modification on sensitive marine habitats within areas like the Baltic Sea EEZ [12]. Beyond direct extraction, associated activities like the improper disposal of waste products, such as mollusk shells, can also cause severe localized environmental issues, including soil pollution and the destruction of habitats like mangrove forests [8].​  

While localized impacts are documented, quantifying the total annual land area lost globally—or comparing the extent of land degradation across diverse regions based specifically on varying aggregate extraction practices—is challenging based on the provided literature. Furthermore, the sources do not contain sufficient data to conduct a comprehensive comparison between the ecological value of the destroyed habitats and the economic value derived from the extracted aggregates. The recognition of these extensive environmental impacts underscores the need for alternatives, such as the use of recycled materials, to reduce reliance on virgin aggregate extraction [11].​  

# 3.2 Resource Depletion  

The extensive extraction of virgin aggregates constitutes a significant drain on natural resources, posing a critical challenge due to their finite nature [11]. While specific studies quantifying global or regional consumption rates and projecting future demand are not comprehensively detailed within the provided digests, the collective evidence underscores a trend of increasing consumption, particularly driven by ongoing infrastructure development [17]. The sheer physical scale of extraction activities provides insight into the rate of resource depletion. For instance, historical and current quarrying operations have resulted in vast excavations, with some sites reaching depths of 28 meters and spanning areas up to 3.2 hectares, fundamentally transforming the landscape and depleting local natural resources [6]. Furthermore, the widespread presence of quarrying and sand excavation traces in areas like the Huangbai River Wetland Park points to significant past exploitation of aggregate resources [23]. The extraction of specific materials like stones for high-quality cement and valuable rocks such as black jade for sale further highlights the diverse uses driving this demand [24].  

Critically evaluating the long-term sustainability of a development paradigm heavily reliant on virgin aggregates reveals significant concerns. Aggregates, including minerals extracted from terrestrial and potentially deep-sea environments, are not renewable on human timescales, implying that resources, once extracted, are permanently removed from the available stock [7]. Continuing high rates of consumption of these non-renewable resources directly contributes to resource overconsumption, which is identified as a cause of habitat destruction [20]. The extraction process itself, such as the removal of gravel and sand, acts as a marine pressure contributing to habitat loss and degradation [12].​  

The implications of increasing consumption rates on resource availability for future generations are substantial. Depletion today means less is available tomorrow, creating a resource bottleneck for future construction and development needs. In light of this, research increasingly advocates for transitioning away from virgin resources towards more sustainable  

alternatives. Studies demonstrate that utilizing recycled materials, such as recycled fine aggregates (RFA) derived from construction and demolition waste (CDW), can directly reduce the demand for natural fine aggregates (NFA) [11]. Similarly, substituting natural sand with recycled aggregate sand is proposed as a response to increasing sand consumption [17]. Even unconventional waste materials like recycled Sururu shells are explored for their potential to serve as eco-friendly aggregates, contributing to the conservation of natural resources and reducing the need for virgin extraction [8]. These approaches promote a circular economy, mitigating the adverse effects of virgin resource depletion and enhancing resource availability for future needs [8,11].​  

# 3.3 Water Resources and Hydrological Alterations  

Aggregate extraction and processing significantly impact water resources through multiple pathways, affecting both surface water and groundwater quality and availability, as well as altering hydrological regimes. A primary pathway involves the release of pollutants, including sediment, chemicals, and heavy metals, into water bodies [5,13,15]. These pollutants can enter waterways through surface runoff from extraction sites, discharge of process water, and soil erosion [13,15,23]. Soil erosion, accelerated by land disturbance during quarrying, contributes substantially to land degradation and leads to the contamination of water sources with organic carbon, nitrogen imbalances, pesticides, and heavy metals [15]. Deep-sea mining, a form of aggregate extraction, further introduces the risk of releasing nutrient-rich and toxin-laden water and generating sediment plumes that can bury and clog the feeding apparatus of deep-sea organisms [7]. These inputs lead to a decline in water quality, characterized by changes in pH, increased turbidity, and elevated concentrations of heavy metals and chemical pollutants [5,13].​  

The impacts on surface water resources are direct, involving increased sediment loads and chemical contamination of rivers and lakes downstream from extraction sites [13,23]. Groundwater resources can also be affected, particularly in areas with abandoned quarries where groundwater seepage leads to the formation of pits and ponds. Continuous monitoring of water levels in such formations is often necessary [6].​  

Quarrying activities also induce significant hydrological alterations. The modification of landscapes due to excavation changes runoff characteristics and can alter streamflow patterns [13,23]. Increased sedimentation in rivers and lakes is a common consequence of these altered regimes and increased erosion [13,23]. The presence and patterns of vegetation play a crucial role in regulating water flow and reducing sedimentation. Altered landscapes, including changes in vegetation cover, impact runoff characteristics [16]. Vegetation increases surface resistance, which decreases flow velocity and increases infiltration, thereby reducing runoff and erosion [16]. Different vegetation patterns exhibit varying effectiveness in providing runoff resistance [16].​  

The production of virgin aggregates is also water-intensive, particularly for activities like washing aggregates [13]. This water usage contributes to the overall water footprint of the industry and can strain local water resources.  

The ecological implications of these impacts are substantial, particularly for aquatic ecosystems. Pollution and hydrological alterations can lead to habitat degradation [12], disrupt ecosystem functions, and impact aquatic life through direct toxicity, reduced oxygen levels (e.g., hypoxia associated with eutrophication), and physical impacts like habitat burial [7,12,20]. Furthermore, the contamination and depletion of water resources have direct consequences for human water supply and other human uses [13,23].  

Mitigation measures are essential to reduce the water-related impacts of aggregate extraction. These can include managing stormwater runoff through infrastructure like dredging and connecting excavated pits [23], implementing vegetation-based strategies such as agroforestry or establishing specific vegetation patterns to reduce erosion and increase infiltration [15,16], and conducting in-situ monitoring of water quality parameters like pH, turbidity, heavy metals, and chemical pollutants [5]. Policy-level interventions, such as integrated water resource management programs aimed at controlling pollution, are also crucial for mitigating the adverse effects on water resources [20]. Effective mitigation requires a comprehensive approach addressing pollutant sources, hydrological alterations, and ecological responses.​  

# 3.4 Air and Noise Pollution  

Aggregate extraction and processing operations represent significant sources of air and noise pollution, impacting environmental quality and human health. Air pollutants generated by these activities primarily include dust and particulate matter, as well as emissions from heavy machinery [5,13]. Beyond mineral dust, the decomposition of organic remnants—  

such as those found in mollusk shells sometimes used as aggregate—can release noxious gases including hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and various amines, further contributing to air quality degradation [8].  

Quantifying pollutant levels provides insight into the magnitude of these impacts. For instance, studies in metropolitan areas like Los Angeles have shown concerning concentrations of key air pollutants. Annual mean $N { \mathsf { O } } _ { 2 }$ concentrations reached 22.30 ppb, with spatial variations showing high levels in traffic corridors, indicative of vehicular traffic being a major contributor that can interact with emissions from other sources such as aggregate transport or machinery [28]. Similarly, $P M _ { 2 \cdot 5 }$ levels averaged  

$$
2 0 . 2 2 \mu \mathrm { g } \mathrm { m } ^ { - 3 } ,
$$  

with the highest concentrations often observed in areas influenced by both traffic and meteorological conditions [28]. While these data are from an urban environment and reflect multiple sources, they illustrate the pollutant burden that aggregaterelated emissions can contribute to, particularly in proximity to extraction sites or transport routes.  

The health risks associated with exposure to these pollutants are substantial. Elevated concentrations of $P M _ { 2 \cdots }$ are linked to various respiratory and cardiovascular issues. Of particular concern is diesel particulate matter (PM), which poses a significant cancer risk, with recorded maximum risks reaching 2463 cases per million in some areas [28]. Workers at extraction sites are directly exposed to high levels of dust and emissions from machinery. Excessive noise from equipment and blasting activities also poses a direct risk to worker health [5]. Beyond the workforce, surrounding communities face health risks from airborne pollutants and excessive noise [5]. Noise pollution is also identified as a potentially harmful diffuse effect on wildlife [13]. These impacts can vary geographically, influenced by proximity to operations, prevailing winds, topography, and existing pollution levels from other sources [28].​  

Assessing the effectiveness of dust control technologies and noise mitigation measures is crucial for reducing these environmental burdens. Air quality monitoring is considered essential for ensuring adherence to regulatory standards and continuously assessing airborne pollutants [5]. While the importance of dust control measures is recognized [13], specific data quantifying the effectiveness of different technologies in the context of aggregate extraction are not detailed in the reviewed literature. Similarly, while the problem of excessive noise is highlighted [5], comprehensive comparisons of noise mitigation effectiveness were not available in the provided digests. Further research is needed to quantify the performance of specific mitigation strategies and their cumulative impact reduction potential.​  

# 3.5 Carbon Footprint and Greenhouse Gas Emissions  

The production of virgin aggregates constitutes a significant component within the broader industrial sector, a major contributor to global CO2 emissions [2]. Within key industrial processes, including those potentially relevant to aggregate processing, a substantial portion $( 3 5 \% )$ of emissions arises from the combustion of fossil fuels to generate high-temperature heat [2]. This highlights the energy-intensive nature of certain stages in aggregate production.​  

Comparing the carbon footprint of virgin aggregate production with that of alternative materials, such as recycled aggregates or waste-derived options like recycled shells, reveals potential environmental benefits of the latter. The utilization of recycled fine aggregates (RFA), for instance, can significantly lower the carbon footprint by reducing the need for extraction and transportation of virgin materials [11]. Similarly, replacing virgin aggregates and/or cement with recycled shells is noted to mitigate the considerable CO2 emissions associated with cement production [8].  

While a specific comprehensive quantification of the total greenhouse gas emissions solely attributable to the global virgin aggregate industry is not explicitly provided across all studies, some data points offer insight. For instance, the production of olivine aggregate used for slag conditioning is reported to generate approximately $5 5 \mathsf { k g } \mathsf { C O 2 }$ equivalent (CO2e) per tonne [9]. A complete cradle-to-site analysis of aggregate impact would encompass emissions from quarrying, crushing, washing, and transportation, considering energy consumption, fuel types, machinery emissions, and potential loss of carbon sequestration in disturbed areas [13].  

The energy efficiency of extraction and processing methods plays a critical role in the overall carbon footprint [2]. Improving energy efficiency in industrial processes can potentially reduce CO2 emissions by $1 5 \mathrm { - } 2 0 \%$ , although achieving deeper reductions typically necessitates more transformative changes such as electrification [2]. Energy consumption during stages like quarrying, crushing, and washing are key factors determining the footprint, alongside the energy demands of transportation [13].  

Transportation distances and modes have a considerable impact on overall carbon emissions. Shifting away from road transport towards methods like trains, ships, or barges can help optimize logistics and reduce the carbon intensity of aggregate delivery [26]. The reduction in transportation needs is an inherent advantage of using locally sourced recycled aggregates [11]. Identifying the most energy-intensive stages of virgin aggregate production typically involves evaluating the energy demands of heavy machinery used in extraction, crushing, and sorting, as well as the energy required for any hightemperature processing steps [2,13]. Energy consumption figures can vary significantly across different extraction sites due to geological conditions, scale of operation, and adopted processing technologies.​  

Efforts to innovate within the mineral products industry, including the adoption of renewable energies and optimization of manufacturing processes, are aimed at reducing the carbon footprint [26]. Technological advancements are generally seen as instrumental in mitigating carbon emissions, as evidenced by studies showing a negative correlation between technological innovation and CO2 emissions [3,14,22].  

# 3.6 Biodiversity Loss and Ecosystem Disruption  

Virgin aggregate extraction constitutes a significant driver of biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption [5]. The fundamental mechanisms involve the physical destruction, loss, fragmentation, and modification of habitats [6,7,13,20,23]. This directly leads to the destruction of biota and disruption of ecological processes necessary for species survival and ecosystem function [7,13,23]. The impact of these pressures on biodiversity can be quantified using metrics such as the Mean Species Abundance (MSA), which measures the remaining abundance of original species relative to undisturbed ecosystems [10].​  

Certain ecosystems exhibit particular vulnerability to virgin aggregate extraction. Deep-sea ecosystems, often targeted for mineral resources, are highly susceptible due to their unique ecological characteristics, including their largely pristine state, high structural complexity, rich diversity, prevalence of rare species, and extremely slow recovery rates following disturbance [7]. Marine environments are also vulnerable, with valuable ecological features such as the underwater parts of rocky islands and sandy shores hosting significant biodiversity, including algae, invertebrates, and vascular plants, which may not be adequately covered by existing conservation frameworks [12]. Furthermore, wetland ecosystems are directly impacted by quarrying and sand excavation, leading to habitat destruction and ecological disruption [23]. Similarly, aquatic ecosystems can be disrupted by sediment buildup resulting from aggregate processing or waste disposal [8]. Terrestrial areas undergoing extraction face land degradation, which includes biological processes leading to a decline in biodiversity [15]. The habitat loss and fragmentation resulting from extraction activities negatively impact species populations, including endangered or threatened species, by reducing available space, isolating populations, and hindering movement and gene flow [7,13,20]. Impacts can extend across borders, affecting migratory species or shared resources through transboundary ecosystem service disruption [21].​  

The loss of biodiversity has profound implications for ecosystem services, which are the benefits humans derive from ecosystems. Biodiversity underpins provisioning, regulating, and cultural services [27]. For instance, deep-sea biodiversity plays a role in critical services such as climate regulation and oxygen production [7]. The degradation of ecosystems due to aggregate extraction diminishes their capacity to provide these essential services. This necessitates robust conservation efforts, starting with monitoring to identify critical habitats and species affected by mining activities, enabling targeted interventions [5].​  

A case study employing the Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) as an aggregate accounting system illustrates the impact of mining on ecosystem service values [27]. This approach summarizes the value of various ecosystem services in a single monetary metric [27]. Analysis showed a significant decrease in the annual average growth rates of GEP from $3 0 . 7 8 \%$ in earlier periods to $9 . 1 \%$ by 2020 [27]. Concurrently, the proportion of regions with rich ecosystem service quality declined sharply from $5 1 . 9 0 \%$ to $3 2 . 1 8 \%$ [27]. Spatial analysis revealed significant spatial correlation and high clustering of GEP changes, with mining areas identified as concentrated high-density and hot spot areas of decline [27]. These findings underscore the direct negative influence of mining activities on ecosystem service values and highlight the potential for integrating ecosystem service considerations, such as GEP valuation, into aggregate mining planning and management to better assess and mitigate impacts.​  

Mitigation and restoration efforts are crucial for protecting biodiversity in areas affected by aggregate extraction. Strategies include the implementation of ecological red line approaches to safeguard critical habitats and support species recovery [20]. Restoration projects focus on recovering degraded ecosystems, such as wetlands, through measures like restoring vegetation and creating ecological conservation areas designed to provide suitable habitats for diverse organisms, including birds [23]. For abandoned quarry sites, restoration involves strategies like introducing soil layers of varying thickness to reestablish conditions for native plant species and utilizing natural forces to aid recovery [6]. While these efforts aim to counteract the negative impacts of extraction, their effectiveness in fully restoring the complexity and resilience of original ecosystems and biodiversity requires careful evaluation and long-term monitoring [5].​  

# 3.7 Cumulative and Transboundary Impacts  

Aggregate extraction activities often transcend political boundaries, leading to significant transboundary environmental impacts. This phenomenon arises because natural ecological systems rarely align precisely with international borders, resulting in neighboring countries sharing ecosystems, species, and consequently, ecosystem services [21].  

Drivers originating in one nation can therefore exert pressure on ecosystem services and human well-being in others [21]. Frameworks such as the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) can be instrumental in elucidating these complex crossborder linkages [21].  

Beyond direct site-specific effects, assessing the environmental footprint of aggregate extraction requires considering broader spatial and temporal scales, encompassing transboundary pollution and the cumulative effects of multiple mining operations [13]. Cumulative environmental hazards can cluster in specific geographical areas, as shown by the concentration of high cumulative impacts in locations like downtown areas and port complexes in studies assessing general environmental hazards [28]. Similarly, in specific ecosystems like the Baltic Sea, the marine environment faces cumulative pressures from multiple sources, including habitat loss, eutrophication, and hypoxia, impacting areas across national waters and exclusive economic zones [12].​  

Furthermore, global trade patterns significantly contribute to transboundary environmental pressures, including biodiversity loss. Analysis indicates that for numerous countries, particularly smaller nations with high import demands from sectors like agriculture and forestry, over half of their biodiversity footprint is attributable to environmental pressures occurring outside their territories [10]. Developed regions such as Europe, North America, and Japan are net importers of biodiversity loss, meaning their consumption patterns drive environmental degradation elsewhere [10]. For instance, approximately half of the biodiversity losses resulting from environmental pressures in Africa have been linked to European consumption [10]. While these studies often focus on land-related impacts, the principle of consumption-driven transboundary environmental burdens extends to resources like virgin aggregates, with trade contributing to biodiversity loss, including that associated with greenhouse gas emissions across global regions [10].​  

Assessing and managing these large-scale, complex impacts presents significant challenges. The spatial scale over which indirect impacts occur is frequently unknown, complicating impact prediction and mitigation efforts [7]. Managing cumulative impacts necessitates regulatory frameworks that are adaptive. Such frameworks should allow for responses like modifying operations, relocating activities, or adjusting protected areas as new data emerges, crucially acting before reaching a threshold of serious harm [7]. The long-term consequences of unmitigated cumulative and transboundary impacts on ecosystem resilience and the sustained provision of ecosystem services are substantial. Cumulative pressures can degrade the health and functionality of shared ecosystems [12], potentially leading to long-term or even irreversible damage that impairs their capacity to provide essential services across affected regions [7].​  

# 4. Socio-Economic Impacts  

The extraction of virgin aggregates exerts multifaceted socio-economic impacts on local communities, encompassing both economic benefits and significant social and environmental costs. Economically, quarrying and associated stone processing often become a primary source of income and employment, particularly in regions with limited alternative economic opportunities. In Fuping, for instance, a county containing ancient Tang Dynasty tombs, local farmers face severely low-yield farmland, resulting in minimal income from agriculture (e.g., 300 yuan/US  

36perpersonperyearfromfarminginSanfengVillage)[24].Incontrast, incomederivedfromsellingquarriedstoneamountedtoapproximately8, 000yuan(US  

964) per person, constituting about $7 0 \%$ of the annual income for local farmers and contributing significantly to local finance [24]. This dependence elevates quarrying to a "pillar" industry for local counties, highlighting its critical role in immediate economic sustenance [24]. Beyond direct income, the aggregate industry contributes through job creation and revenue generation for local communities [13]. Emerging areas like deep-sea mining are also promoted under the concept of "Blue Growth," aiming for sustainable economic development, with the principle of the Common Heritage of Mankind suggesting that benefits should accrue to the international community, particularly developing states [7].

However, these short-term economic gains frequently conflict with the preservation of cultural heritage and environmental integrity. In Fuping, the economic imperative led local governments to support the cement industry and stone quarries, sometimes neglecting the protection of historical relics, including the Tang Dynasty tombs [24]. Prioritizing immediate financial benefits over long-term cultural preservation carries profound implications, potentially resulting in irreversible loss of invaluable historical assets [24].  

The distribution of economic benefits and environmental costs associated with virgin aggregate extraction is often uneven. While the industry generates revenue and employment, communities near extraction sites disproportionately bear the environmental burden [13]. These environmental costs include expenses for remediation and the loss of valuable ecosystem services [13]. The spatial-temporal relationship between economic factors like GDP and mining effects illustrates the potential for conflict or synergy, although achieving a "win-win" scenario for both the economy and the ecological environment requires careful management, such as restricting the annual growth rate of mining areas [27]. Furthermore, the increase in government investment in environmental governance, while positive for the environment, may introduce uncertainty in economic policies that could negatively affect resident income and employment levels [29].  

The social impacts of quarrying extend to community well-being and potential conflicts. Extraction activities can lead to the displacement of communities and negatively impact property values [13]. Environmental degradation caused by quarrying and associated activities, such as unregulated dumping of waste materials like shells, can pose public health risks due to unsanitary conditions in public spaces [8], leading to health problems and loss of livelihoods [13].​  

Addressing these social impacts requires effective community engagement and compensation mechanisms. Mining companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of a "social license to operate," which can be fostered through demonstrating environmental stewardship, particularly via transparent environmental monitoring and reporting [5]. Involving local communities directly in monitoring efforts can enhance relationships and promote collaborative approaches to environmental protection [5]. Post-extraction land rehabilitation, such as transforming abandoned quarries into public recreational spaces [6,23] or utilizing agroforestry for ecological and economic security [15], can offer alternative socioeconomic benefits and mitigate negative impacts.  

Socioeconomic factors can exacerbate the vulnerability of certain communities to the adverse effects of aggregate extraction. Studies indicate a correlation between cumulative environmental hazards and the spatial distribution of racial– ethnic minority populations and areas with high poverty levels [28]. For example, census tracts in Los Angeles with the highest percentage of nonwhite residents (up to $9 9 . 9 6 \%$ ) and populations below $2 0 0 \%$ of the federal poverty level (up to $9 6 . 2 0 \%$ ) were observed to overlap geographically with areas facing higher environmental hazards, suggesting that existing socioeconomic disparities can render these communities more susceptible to the negative environmental and social consequences of industrial activities like aggregate extraction [28].  

# 5. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Virgin Aggregates  

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) serves as a crucial tool for evaluating the potential environmental impacts associated with virgin aggregate production and utilization, typically encompassing stages from raw material extraction to their incorporation into construction projects [13]. Methodologies employed in LCA studies necessitate careful definition of system boundaries, functional units, and impact assessment methods to ensure robust and comparable results.​  

![](images/c735e59eb3f8dd38a7d8aea2b0e076d008eca17942b76828797fa212e30271f0.jpg)  

One approach involves a "cradle to site" system boundary, which includes the environmental burdens related to material production, transportation to the construction site, and on-site construction processes [13]. For instance, one study adopted this scope for analyzing a hospital building project, detailing the environmental footprint of materials including aggregates [13]. A notable methodological step in this study was the conversion of Bill of Quantity (BOQ) data into a Bill of Materials (BOM) using an official analysis of rate (AOR) document, which allowed for detailed quantification of materials [13]. This BOM data was then linked with India-specific characterization factors across six environmental domains to calculate the total life cycle footprint [13]. While this method offers a detailed, project-specific inventory based on readily available construction documents like BOQ and AOR, representing a significant novelty, its strength is contingent on the accuracy and granularity of these source documents and the availability of relevant regional characterization factors [13].​  

Key environmental indicators commonly assessed in LCA studies of virgin aggregates and construction materials include energy use, global warming potential, ozone depletion potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, and photochemical ozone creation potential [13]. The selection and weighting of these indicators significantly influence the perceived environmental hotspots within the aggregate life cycle, which typically include extraction, crushing, screening, and transportation phases due to energy consumption and emissions.  

Despite the utility of LCA, significant data gaps and uncertainties persist, hindering the comprehensive assessment of virgin aggregates. These limitations stem from factors such as regional variations in geological conditions, extraction techniques (e.g., quarrying vs. dredging), and transportation distances, which can drastically alter environmental profiles but are often not adequately captured in generic databases. Furthermore, assessing long-term environmental effects, such as land degradation post-extraction or the leaching of substances from aggregates over the service life of structures, presents methodological challenges. A critical limitation, particularly noted in contexts like the Indian construction sector, is the lack of access to detailed, project-specific inventory data for all materials and processes [13]. Additionally, the absence of comprehensive and up-to-date regional environmental footprint databases hinders the application of relevant characterization factors, necessitating reliance on potentially less representative global or foreign datasets [13]. These data gaps necessitate the exclusion of certain life cycle stages, such as the use, operation, maintenance, and end-of-life phases, from the system boundary due to data unavailability [13].​  

Addressing these limitations in future research requires several strategies. Developing standardized protocols for collecting detailed inventory data specific to aggregate production sites and regional transportation networks is essential. Furthermore, investing in the creation and maintenance of comprehensive, region-specific life cycle inventory databases and characterization factors would significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of LCA studies [13]. Methodological advancements are also needed to better incorporate the long-term environmental impacts of aggregate use and the end-oflife phase, possibly through dynamic LCA approaches or integrated modeling techniques. Finally, increasing data transparency and accessibility within the industry could facilitate more robust and verifiable LCA results.  

# 6. Mitigation Strategies and Sustainable Alternatives  

Addressing the significant environmental impacts associated with virgin aggregate extraction necessitates a multi-faceted approach encompassing mitigation during operations, post-extraction restoration, and crucially, the adoption of sustainable alternative materials.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Strategy Category</td><td>Description / Examples</td><td>Primary Goal(s)</td></tr><tr><td>Sustainable Extraction</td><td>Practices during operation (erosion control, water/air mgmt)</td><td>Minimize environmental footprint at the source</td></tr><tr><td>Rehabilitation/Restoration</td><td>Post-extraction re- vegetation, habitat creation, water mgmt</td><td>Reclaim land,restore ecosystems/biodiversity</td></tr><tr><td>Recycled Aggregates</td><td>From CDW (RCA, RFA, RA)</td><td>Reduce virgin resource demand, divert waste, circularity</td></tr><tr><td>Mine Tailings/By-products</td><td>Tailings,fly ash, slag</td><td>Waste utilization, resource conservation, CO2 potential</td></tr><tr><td>Novel Materials</td><td>Shells, Geopolymers</td><td>Eco-friendly substitutes, lower impact binders</td></tr></table></body></html>  

While sustainable extraction practices focus on minimizing the environmental footprint at the source by controlling erosion, managing water and air quality, reducing waste and energy consumption, and preserving biodiversity [7,13,16,26], and rehabilitation and restoration efforts aim to reinstate ecological function and biodiversity in disturbed areas through methods like re-vegetation and habitat creation guided by environmental monitoring [5,6,13,23], a fundamental strategy involves replacing virgin aggregates with alternative sources. This section compares these different strategic pillars, with a particular focus on evaluating the potential, feasibility, benefits, and challenges associated with utilizing alternative materials, thereby reducing the primary demand for extracted virgin resources [11].  

The potential for replacing virgin aggregates lies in the increasing availability and technological viability of various alternative materials, including recycled aggregates derived from construction and demolition waste, mine tailings and industrial by-products, and novel materials like alternative shell aggregates and geopolymers [1,8,11,13]. Recycled aggregates, such as recycled concrete aggregate (RCA), recycled fine aggregates (RFA), and recycled aggregate sand (RA), offer a direct substitute in various applications, from conventional concrete to lightweight pervious concrete and 3D-printed mortar [4,11,13,17]. Similarly, mine tailings and industrial by-products like fly ash and slag, while sometimes used as supplementary cementitious materials, are also explored for their aggregate potential [1,13]. Waste streams like Sururu shells present opportunities as fine aggregate substitutes [8]. Geopolymers, utilizing industrial byproducts as precursors, function as a binder alternative to cement, indirectly reducing aggregate demand by enabling sustainable concrete production [1].​  

The environmental and economic benefits of promoting these materials are substantial. Utilizing recycled and wastederived aggregates directly contributes to a circular economy by diverting vast quantities of waste from landfills and conserving finite natural resources [1,8,11]. Life cycle assessments often indicate lower environmental burdens compared to virgin materials, particularly in raw material acquisition and waste disposal phases [13]. Furthermore, certain materials like mine tailings offer potential for carbon dioxide sequestration through enhanced weathering [9], while others like fly ash and slag reduce the carbon footprint of cement production when used as SCMs [1]. Economic benefits can arise from reduced material costs, potential revenue from waste processing, and avoided landfill fees, although cost-effectiveness is influenced by factors like processing, transportation, and market demand.​  

Despite the clear advantages, the wider adoption of alternative materials faces several challenges and barriers. Ensuring consistent quality control is paramount due to the inherent variability and heterogeneous nature of waste streams and industrial by-products [4,17]. Potential contamination from undesirable substances in the source materials can compromise the performance and environmental safety of the final product [13]. Technical performance can differ from virgin aggregates; for example, recycled aggregate sand may exhibit specific shear behavior characteristics distinct from natural sand, requiring careful consideration in design and application [17]. Other challenges include public perception regarding the use of "waste" materials, the need for standardized regulations and specifications tailored to alternative aggregates, and optimizing mix designs for specific applications like 3D printing with recycled fines [11]. Overcoming these barriers requires continued research into material properties, development of effective processing and quality control measures, supportive regulatory frameworks [29], and demonstrating the long-term durability and reliability of structures built with these materials. Innovative solutions, such as developing non-hazardous activators for geopolymers compatible with existing concrete plant infrastructure, can facilitate integration into current practices [1]. Ultimately, realizing the full potential of alternative materials as a mitigation strategy requires addressing technical, economic, regulatory, and perceptual challenges in a comprehensive manner [11].  

# 6.1 Sustainable Extraction Practices  

Minimizing the environmental footprint of virgin aggregate extraction necessitates the implementation of best management practices across various operational phases. A key aspect of sustainable extraction involves controlling erosion and sedimentation, which significantly impacts soil stability and water quality [16]. Research indicates that integrating vegetation management strategies, such as establishing grass strips in strategic locations, can effectively regulate hydrodynamic processes, thereby reducing the scouring energy of surface runoff and preventing soil erosion [16].  

Managing water quality is another critical component of sustainable extraction. Practices include minimizing water pollution [13] and, in specific contexts like deep-sea mining, implementing plume management strategies to control the dispersal of fine sediments and other materials [7]. Beyond water quality, sustainable operations also aim to reduce air and noise pollution [13].​  

Efforts to minimize waste and energy consumption are central to reducing the overall environmental impact. The mineral products industry is adopting methods such as optimizing manufacturing processes and improving transport efficiency [26]. The use of alternative raw materials is also being explored, which can decrease the reliance on virgin resources and associated extraction impacts [26]. General practices for minimizing waste and reducing energy consumption during extraction are recognized as essential [13].​  

Furthermore, sustainable practices extend to minimizing habitat destruction and promoting biodiversity conservation [13]. Strategies to achieve this include reducing the physical footprint of mining operations within a contracted area [7]. Reticulated extraction patterns, for instance, involve leaving large, contiguous areas undisturbed by direct mining, allowing associated fauna and minerals to remain in place [7]. Establishing impact-free refugia can also contribute to biodiversity preservation within or adjacent to extraction sites [7]. Responsible site design should also prioritize safety, with facilities and paths intentionally avoiding dangerous zones while acknowledging the site's unique features [6]. Collectively, these practices form a comprehensive approach to mitigating the environmental consequences associated with virgin aggregate extraction.​  

# 6.2 Rehabilitation and Restoration  

Rehabilitation and restoration are critical phases in mitigating the environmental impacts associated with virgin aggregate extraction, seeking to reinstate ecological function and biodiversity in disturbed areas [13]. This process is often considered after initial impact mitigation efforts have been maximized [7]. Common strategies employed include re-vegetation, habitat creation, and water management, all aimed at restoring disturbed ecosystems and promoting biodiversity [13]. Revegetation, in particular, is recognized as a crucial technique for quarry site rehabilitation [16].​  

Various methodologies have been implemented in practice. For instance, the rehabilitation of abandoned quarries at Nanning Garden Expo Park involved a multi-faceted approach [6]. Techniques included using UAV aerial scanning to precisely match site landforms, introducing soil to establish viable planting areas, and the strategic use of native plant species [6]. A notable aspect was the tailoring of design strategies to the unique characteristics of each quarry, transforming areas into distinct features such as a wooden pavilion with a waterfall or an aquatic garden [6].  

Another example is the ecological restoration of the degraded wetland ecosystem at Yichang Huangbai River Wetland Park, which serves as a relevant reference for aggregate extraction sites [23]. This project addressed degradation resulting from sand excavation through methods such as dredging and connecting residual pits and ponds to form an integrated "sponge system" and rain gardens [23]. Key to its success was the restoration of wetland vegetation using native and suitable wetland plant species to enhance regional biodiversity [23]. Furthermore, shoreline modification and water depth adjustments were undertaken to create more natural water body forms while ensuring safety [23].​  

Comparing these approaches reveals both commonalities and site-specific adaptations. Both projects emphasized the use of native or suitable local plant species, a fundamental principle in ecological restoration for promoting biodiversity [6,23]. However, the specific techniques differed based on the nature of the degraded site; the Nanning quarry project focused on terrestrial/rocky landscapes requiring landform reconstruction and soil addition [6], while the Yichang wetland project centered on aquatic systems requiring dredging and water body reconfiguration [23]. The Nanning project also integrated specific landscape design features for each quarry, highlighting aesthetic considerations alongside ecological goals [6].  

Specific re-vegetation technologies, such as agroforestry, have demonstrated efficacy in rehabilitating degraded lands [15]. Techniques like establishing vegetative barriers using hedgerows of specific tree species and grasses, along with tree plantations and trenching, are effective in enhancing soil quality, reducing erosion, and sequestering carbon [15]. The position of vegetation, such as grass strips, is particularly important for maximizing the effectiveness of erosion control [16]. Effective rehabilitation and restoration initiatives are guided by data collected through environmental monitoring, which helps assess conditions and inform strategies for disturbed ecosystems [5].  

Despite the array of strategies and demonstrated project examples, significant knowledge gaps persist, particularly concerning the long-term ecological impacts and quantitative success rates of rehabilitation projects in aggregate extraction sites. While methods are described, detailed, long-term monitoring data on biodiversity recovery trajectories, ecosystem service restoration levels, and the resilience of restored sites over extended periods are often limited in the available literature. Furthermore, extending successful terrestrial remediation requirements to challenging environments like the deep sea presents numerous conceptual and practical hurdles, indicating another area requiring further research and development [7]. Understanding the long-term ecological outcomes and refining evaluation metrics are crucial for improving future rehabilitation efforts and ensuring the sustainable management of land affected by aggregate extraction.  

# 6.3 Recycled Aggregates  

Recycled aggregates, primarily derived from construction and demolition waste, offer a sustainable alternative to virgin aggregate extraction [1,13]. Their utilization contributes significantly to the development of a circular economy, reducing landfill reliance and conserving natural resources [1,11]. Sources of recycled aggregates include recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) from crushed concrete [13], recycled fine aggregates (RFA), and recycled aggregate sand (RA) [11,17]. Processing typically involves crushing waste materials, such as discarded concrete or various rock types like sandstone, basalt, and river pebble [17], to produce aggregates of desired sizes and gradations. Specific recycled materials, such as Sururu shells, have also been explored as substitutes for fine aggregates in mortar [8].​  

The performance characteristics of recycled aggregates vary depending on their source and processing, impacting their suitability for different applications. In concrete production, recycled aggregates have been investigated for various applications, including standard concrete, lightweight pervious concrete, and 3D-printed mortar [4,11]. Studies comparing recycled aggregate concrete with conventional concrete highlight differences in mechanical properties and durability, often linked to the quality of the recycled aggregate source. For instance, RCAs produced from concretes with low compressive strength have been shown to yield pervious concrete with correspondingly low strength, with compressive strengths varying between 1.50 and 2.00 MPa in lightweight pervious concrete applications designed for pedestrian use [4]. The optimal mix design parameters, such as water-cement ratio $( \mathsf { w } / \mathsf { c } )$ and aggregate-cement ratio $( \mathsf { a } / \mathsf { c } )$ , and aggregate gradation, also significantly influence the resulting properties like bulk density $( 1 1 6 0 - 1 0 8 0 \mathrm { k g } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 } )$ ) and permeability [4]. Research on recycled aggregate sand (RA) has compared its particle shape and shear behavior under loading conditions against natural quartz sand (QS), providing insights into its potential as a substitute in various construction layers [17]. For emerging technologies like 3D printing, the mechanical properties of RFA in mortar have been assessed, emphasizing the need for optimizing mix designs to enhance both sustainability and performance [11]. Generally, the variability inherent in the source material of recycled aggregates, such as different concrete strengths or rock types, presents challenges in achieving consistent mechanical properties compared to using standardized virgin aggregates [4,17].​  

Beyond performance, the environmental benefits of using recycled aggregates are a key driver for their adoption. These benefits include substantial reductions in the volume of waste sent to landfills and the conservation of finite natural resources required for virgin aggregate extraction [11]. Lifecycle environmental impact assessments comparing recycled and virgin aggregates often indicate lower environmental burdens associated with recycled materials, particularly concerning raw material acquisition and waste disposal [13].  

Despite the environmental advantages and demonstrated performance in various applications, the widespread adoption of recycled aggregates faces challenges. Ensuring consistent quality control is critical due to the heterogeneous nature of construction and demolition waste sources [4,17]. Potential contamination from non-aggregate materials can also impact performance. While not detailed in the provided digests, issues such as public perception and standardized regulations can also influence the utilization rates of recycled aggregates. Evaluating the full lifecycle environmental impacts necessitates considering factors beyond resource conservation and waste reduction, including the energy and emissions associated with transportation, processing, and potential further disposal of recycled materials, although a comprehensive analysis across all these stages was not fully detailed in the provided digests [13].  

# 6.4 Mine Tailings and Industrial By-products  

The utilization of mine tailings and various industrial by-products as substitutes for virgin aggregates presents a significant opportunity to mitigate the environmental burden associated with traditional aggregate extraction. This approach not only reduces the demand for finite natural resources but also addresses the substantial quantities of waste materials generated by industrial processes. Identifying the specific types of these materials suitable for aggregate applications requires an evaluation of their inherent properties and potential environmental impacts [13].  

Several industrial by-products and waste streams have been explored for their potential as aggregate substitutes. Prominent examples include mine tailings, fly ash, and slag [1,13]. Fly ash and slag, in particular, are well-established supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) that can significantly reduce the carbon footprint associated with cement production when used in concrete [1]. While the digests mention the potential use of these materials as aggregates, detailed information regarding their specific chemical composition, physical properties, and performance characteristics as aggregates is not extensively provided within the current scope. However, their suitability hinges on meeting the technical requirements for various applications, such as concrete production, road construction, or backfilling, which necessitates rigorous characterization.​  

A notable environmental benefit associated with certain waste materials, particularly mine tailings, is their potential for carbon dioxide sequestration [9]. Mining operations globally produce an estimated mean quantity of approximately 13 Gt·year⁻¹ of tailings material [9]. The largest volumes of tailings originate from the extraction of commodities such as Cu (mean ATPX $\approx 1 0$ Gt·year⁻¹), Fe, and Au [9]. Other deposit types producing substantial tailings include those for U, Al, Ni, and PGM [9], while deposits for Pb, Sn, W, Ti, and diamonds generally produce less than 20 Mt·year⁻¹ [9]. The carbon sequestration potential of these tailings is primarily attributed to the presence of Mg–Fe–Ca-bearing silicate minerals, including olivine, serpentine, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and amphibole [9]. Deposits hosting high abundances of Ca– Mg-bearing silicates exhibit the highest potential for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) per unit mass of tailings [9]. Globally, the hypothetical maximum CDR capacity of mine wastes from selected commodities and deposit types is estimated to be substantial, ranging from approximately 1.1 to 4.5 Gt $C O _ { 2 }$ annually, potentially offsetting a significant portion $( 3 1 - 1 2 5 \%$ ) of the industry's primary emissions [9]. However, current understanding indicates that the dissolution rates of the relevant minerals can be slow, suggesting that only a fraction (roughly $3 - 2 1 \%$ ) of this theoretical potential may be realized within a 50-year timeframe [9]. This “enhanced weathering and alkalinity production potential” (Eₚₒₜ) represents a hypothetical maximum [9]. Beyond $C O _ { 2 }$ sequestration, the use of materials like fly ash and slag directly contributes to environmental improvements by reducing the reliance on virgin materials in cement production, a process known for its high carbon emissions [1].​  

Despite the environmental benefits, the use of mine tailings and industrial by-products as aggregate substitutes is not without potential risks. A primary concern is the potential leaching of heavy metals or other contaminants contained within these waste streams into the surrounding environment [13]. The specific composition of tailings and by-products varies significantly depending on the source material and processing methods, necessitating thorough characterization and testing to assess potential leaching behavior and ensure compliance with environmental regulations. Proper processing and stabilization techniques may be required to mitigate such risks.​  

Evaluating the overall suitability of these materials requires considering not only their technical performance and environmental impacts (benefits and risks) but also the economic and logistical feasibility of their utilization. While the sheer volume of available tailings (approximately 13 Gt·year⁻¹) highlights their potential as a widespread resource [9], factors such as location relative to potential markets, transportation costs, processing requirements, and regulatory frameworks play crucial roles in determining their economic viability and widespread adoption. The potential for carbon sequestration further adds an economic dimension, especially in the context of carbon pricing or carbon credits, although the slow reaction rates pose a challenge to realizing the full theoretical potential [9]. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment must integrate environmental, technical, economic, and logistical factors to determine the most promising applications and strategies for deploying mine tailings and industrial by-products as sustainable aggregate alternatives.  

# 6.5 Alternative Shell Materials  

The exploration of sustainable alternatives to virgin aggregates is crucial for mitigating the environmental impacts associated with their extraction and use [8].  

Shell materials, often considered waste products from the seafood industry, have emerged as potential candidates for use as aggregates in construction materials [8].  

Assessing the feasibility of utilizing such materials necessitates a detailed understanding of their physical and chemical properties, as well as their performance when incorporated into cementitious matrices [8].  

Research into Sururu shell aggregate (SSA) provides insight into the characteristics of one such alternative material [8].  

The properties reported for SSA include a specific gravity of $2 . 6 6 \ g / c m ^ { 3 }$ , a unit weight of $1 , 4 5 3 \ k g / m ^ { 3 }$ , a void index of $4 2 \%$ , and a water absorption rate of $1 . 2 4 \%$ [8]. Particle size analysis indicates that a minimal amount of grains, less than $0 . 1 \%$ , are larger than $1 . 1 8 \mathsf { m m }$ [8]. Chemically, SSA is primarily composed of $C a C O _ { 3 }$ ​ , constituting $9 7 . 8 6 \%$ of its composition [8].  

These reported properties suggest potential suitability for use in construction applications. The specific gravity of 2.66 $g / c m ^ { 3 }$ is within a range comparable to some types of natural aggregates. The low percentage of particles larger than 1.18 mm indicates a fine aggregate material, potentially suitable for mortar or specific concrete applications depending on grading. A water absorption rate of $1 . 2 4 \%$ is relatively low for a porous material like shells, which is a favorable characteristic for aggregates in cementitious materials as it influences the water–cement ratio and overall mix design. The high $C a C O _ { 3 }$ content is also a significant property, as calcium carbonate can react with cement hydration products over time, potentially influencing durability and strength development [8]. Utilizing shell waste streams as aggregates directly contributes to reducing the demand for virgin materials and diverting waste from landfills, aligning with principles of circular economy and sustainability, thereby mitigating some of the environmental burdens associated with traditional aggregate production [8].​  

# 6.6 Geopolymers  

Geopolymers, also known as alkaline-activated materials, represent a significant advancement in sustainable construction as a viable alternative to traditional Portland cement concrete [1]. Their composition involves the reaction of a precursor material, typically a waste or byproduct such as Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) or fly ash (FA), with an alkaline activator solution [1]. This activator is commonly a mixture of caustic soda and sodium silicate, which reacts with the precursor in the presence of water to form a geopolymer structure [1].  

Compared to conventional cement, geopolymers offer substantial environmental benefits, primarily characterized by a low environmental impact [1]. Specifically, research indicates that geopolymers contribute to reduced carbon emissions and energy consumption during production [1]. This is largely attributed to the utilization of industrial byproducts and processing at lower temperatures compared to the high-temperature calcination required for cement clinker production.  

In terms of performance characteristics, geopolymers exhibit a denser microstructure than typical cementitious paste [1]. This inherent structural density contributes to excellent resistance against aggressive chemical agents [1]. Such durability makes geopolymers particularly suitable for demanding applications, including precast concrete elements intended for environments subject to high anthropic impact [1]. While the provided information highlights resistance to chemical attack and structural density, comprehensive data on strength development and long-term durability across various conditions relative to traditional concrete would necessitate further investigation.​  

The wider adoption of geopolymers in the construction industry faces challenges, such as variability in precursor material properties, optimization of alkaline activator compositions, and concerns regarding handler safety due to the alkaline nature of activators. However, opportunities are emerging through innovative developments. For instance, an innovative type of geopolymer concrete utilizes a non-hazardous alkaline liquid slag activator (MAPECUBE GEO) [1]. This specific  

activator demonstrates compatibility with standard polycarboxylate ether (PCE) superplasticizers, which are commonly used in traditional concrete production [1]. This compatibility is a significant advantage, as it facilitates the manufacture of geopolymer-based concrete using existing plant infrastructure and standard methods already employed for Portland-based concrete, thereby mitigating potential barriers related to processing and equipment [1]. Overcoming challenges related to standardization, cost-effectiveness, and long-term performance validation under diverse environmental conditions will be key to realizing the full potential and widespread application of geopolymers as a sustainable construction material.  

# 7. Policy and Regulatory Frameworks

The environmental impact of virgin aggregate extraction is intrinsically linked to the policy and regulatory frameworks governing the mining industry and the promotion of sustainable material alternatives. Globally, there is an increasing recognition of the importance of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors as drivers for sustainable practices within the mining sector [19]. Governments play a crucial role in developing roadmaps for industrial decarbonization and adjusting regulations and incentives to support this transition, including encouraging investment in renewable energy generation [2]. Environmental regulation, encompassing economic, legal, and supervised dimensions, is identified as a potent policy tool capable of significantly improving energy efficiency, reducing carbon emissions, and enhancing the ecological environment [29]. Achieving a balance between economic growth and environmental sustainability to effectively combat climate change necessitates integrated policy approaches and guidelines for sustainable development practices [14].​  

Regulatory frameworks governing aggregate extraction vary significantly across regions and jurisdictions, reflecting diverse environmental priorities and governance structures [13]. Many mining operations are subject to numerous regulations aimed at minimizing environmental impacts, requiring companies to conduct environmental monitoring to ensure compliance [5]. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), which often rely on models to predict potential ecological effects, are a common regulatory tool. Examples of specific regulatory approaches include China's ecological red line approach for biodiversity and land use protection, alongside the establishment of extensive protected areas to prevent habitat loss [20]. China's "Fourteenth Five-Year Plan for Historical Legacy Mine Ecological Restoration Action," which incorporates green mine inspections, signifies a national effort towards remediation and sustainability in mining [19]. Furthermore, regional regulations, such as those in Shaanxi Province for protecting cultural relics during construction or agricultural activities, can impose strict limitations on excavation in specific areas [24]. At the international level, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) governs mining activities in the deep seabed "Area" beyond national jurisdiction, designating it as the "Common Heritage of Mankind" and requiring the International Seabed Authority (ISA) to ensure effective protection of the marine environment [7]. The ISA is actively drafting exploitation regulations that incorporate environmental considerations [7]. Regional international agreements like the EU Habitats Directive and broader targets such as the Aichi biodiversity targets also mandate the conservation of natural areas, including marine environments, potentially affecting aggregate extraction [12].​  

Policies promoting sustainable aggregate management often include mandates and incentives for the use of alternative materials and practices. For instance, regulations in Italy, such as UNI EN 197-1:2011, UNI EN 206:2021, and UNI 11104:2016, prescribe the composition, specifications, and compliance criteria for cement utilizing supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) and for concrete production, thereby facilitating the adoption of more sustainable binding agents [1]. The principle of "Avoid $>$ Reduce $>$ Reverse land degradation" serves as a key strategic guide for land use planning towards achieving land degradation neutrality, emphasizing avoidance as the most cost-effective approach [18]. Initiatives promoting mindful resource utilization, such as India's LiFE movement, also contribute to a policy environment conducive to reducing demand for virgin materials [15]. Financial instruments and incentives play a significant role; examples include the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) climaterelated disclosure rules, which incentivize decarbonization within industries, including mining [19]. Policies emphasizing carbon pricing, renewable energy targets, energy efficiency standards, and direct incentives for the development and deployment of green technology demonstrably reduce carbon emissions, highlighting the effectiveness of policy stringency.  

Despite the existence of policies promoting sustainable practices, significant barriers hinder the wider adoption of sustainable aggregates and related innovations. A major impediment is the acceptance from the construction industry and regulatory bodies, who often rely on traditional materials with established performance histories [26]. Companies in the mineral products sector are actively working to encourage customers to adopt these newer, more sustainable innovations [26].​  

Challenges in enforcing environmental regulations and monitoring programs persist. While companies are required to conduct monitoring to ensure compliance [5], the effectiveness of regulations is contingent upon rigorous oversight. The persistence of threats to protected sites, such as quarrying near Tang Dynasty tombs despite existing cultural heritage regulations, suggests potential weaknesses in enforcement mechanisms or monitoring effectiveness [24]. Improving compliance and promoting sustainable aggregate management requires companies to stay informed about evolving regulations and ensure their monitoring efforts align with legal requirements [5]. Strategies for improvement involve governments continuing to refine roadmaps, adjust regulations and incentives [2,19]. Promoting the acceptance of innovative sustainable materials within the industry is also critical [14,26]. Furthermore, integrated policy approaches that balance economic and environmental goals are essential [14]. Ecological restoration demonstration projects exemplify proactive strategies for mitigating past impacts and promoting sustainable land management [23].​  

In conclusion, a complex web of international, national, and regional policies and regulations influences virgin aggregate extraction and the potential for sustainable alternatives. While frameworks exist to protect the environment, promote conservation, and incentivize greener practices, challenges remain in terms of inconsistent regional approaches, industry acceptance of innovative materials, and effective enforcement and monitoring. Addressing these gaps requires continuous policy refinement, stronger implementation mechanisms, and collaborative efforts across governments, industries, and international bodies.​  

# 8. Case Studies and Best Practices  

Case studies provide crucial insights into the environmental impacts associated with virgin aggregate extraction and the efficacy of implemented mitigation strategies. Analysis of diverse real‐world examples reveals common success factors and highlights transferable best practices for sustainable aggregate management.  

A prominent area of study involves the ecological restoration and landscape transformation of abandoned mining and quarrying sites. The Nanning Garden Expo Park quarry gardens project exemplifies this, demonstrating the potential to convert environmentally damaged areas into aesthetically pleasing and ecologically functional landscapes [6]. Similarly, the Yichang Huangbai River Wetland Park serves as a case study for the successful ecological restoration of a site degraded by aggregate extraction [23]. Key strategies employed included minimizing human intervention, restoring native vegetation, and designing a resilient landscape capable of managing stormwater and providing wildlife habitat [23]. The project underscored the significance of stormwater analysis in planning for flood‐prone areas [23]. Related efforts in land rehabilitation include the application of agroforestry systems in India, utilizing species like _Acacia nilotica_ and _Acacia tortilis_ in silvi‐pastoral systems for ravine regions, and cultivating diverse crops in agri‐horticulture systems across various agro‐climatic zones [15]. Furthermore, studies on vegetation patterns—for instance, those conducted on the Loess Plateau in China—demonstrate the effectiveness of strategically placed vegetation (e.g., grass strips on the lower upslope) in regulating hydrodynamic processes and reducing soil erosion, a critical issue on disturbed lands [16]. Ecosystem management in mining areas is further supported by spatial–temporal analyses of Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP), contributing to sustainable regional development [27].​  

Beyond post‐extraction restoration, sustainable practices are being implemented within active mining and material use cycles. Leading mining companies are focusing on supply chain sustainability, labor relations, and community benefits in overseas projects, attempting to set a standard for responsible practices [19]. In the context of deep‐sea mining, experiments like DISCOL evaluate potential impacts, although challenges remain in identifying unaffected control sites [7]. Mitigation attempts, such as the case of Nautilus Minerals leaving a nearby site unmined, illustrate efforts to address predicted biodiversity losses, though the goal of zero net loss remains challenging [7].​  

The exploration and utilization of alternative materials offer another pathway to reduce reliance on virgin aggregates. The potential use of Sururu shells in Brazil demonstrates how waste streams from other industries, such as fishing, can be repurposed as eco‐friendly aggregates [8]. Research into sustainable concrete alternatives, such as geopolymer concrete and concrete with hybrid reinforcement, investigates materials with potentially lower environmental impacts compared to traditional cement‐based concrete, focusing on structural performance, durability, and environmental footprint [1]. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) case studies on residential buildings highlight that materials like bricks, aluminum, steel, and cement are major contributors to environmental impact, with the material manufacturing stage being a significant hotspot [13]. This finding reinforces the importance of developing and utilizing alternative, lower‐impact materials.​  

Policy and regulatory frameworks play a crucial role in guiding sustainable aggregate management. A successful policy response to protect cultural heritage from quarrying impacts is demonstrated by the relocation of a brick‐making factory and local residents from the protection zones of ancient imperial mausoleums, involving compensation and the construction of new settlements [24]. Spatial planning tools, such as the evaluation of the Finnish MPA network using extensive data and spatial prioritization methods, provide a template for identifying and protecting ecologically sensitive areas from potential extraction activities [12]. Broader biodiversity conservation efforts, like China's successful protection of the giant panda through protected areas and monitoring systems, illustrate effective national policies for environmental preservation that can inform regional resource management strategies [20]. Collaborative platforms, such as the US–China Clean Energy Research Center (CERC), demonstrate how international cooperation and joint R&D can facilitate the development and adoption of cleaner technologies relevant to the construction and materials sectors [3].  

Comparing these diverse case studies reveals several common success factors. Integrated approaches that combine ecological restoration with landscape aesthetics and functional design are effective for rehabilitating degraded sites [6,23]. Proactive spatial planning and the establishment of protected areas are vital for preventing impacts in sensitive environments [12,20,24]. The development and adoption of alternative materials and waste utilization strategies offer promising pathways to reduce the demand for virgin resources [1,8]. Furthermore, successful implementation often involves stakeholder engagement, including compensation for affected communities and integrating sustainability considerations into corporate practices [19,24]. Scientific tools like LCA, GEP analysis, and spatial modeling provide essential data for informed decision‐making and impact assessment [12,13,27].​  

While these cases highlight successful strategies, challenges remain. Ensuring the long‐term ecological success and resilience of restored sites requires sustained effort and monitoring. Scaling up successful site‐specific interventions to regional or national levels can be complex. Accurately assessing the full environmental impacts of activities, particularly in challenging environments like the deep sea, remains difficult [7]. Balancing economic demands for aggregates with environmental protection objectives continues to be a fundamental challenge.  

Key lessons learned include the importance of integrated planning that considers environmental, social, and economic factors. Utilizing scientific tools for assessment and planning is crucial. Exploring and implementing alternative materials and waste valorization should be prioritized. Effective policies involve clear regulations, protected areas, and mechanisms for addressing community impacts.​  

Based on these case studies, practical recommendations for future projects include conducting comprehensive environmental impact assessments (using tools like LCA and spatial analysis) before extraction begins, implementing site specific restoration plans based on successful models like those in Nanning and Yichang, actively researching and incorporating alternative materials and recycled aggregates into construction, utilizing spatial planning to avoid sensitive ecosystems, and developing robust policies that include stakeholder engagement, compensation mechanisms, and long‐ term monitoring requirements. Opportunities exist in further R&D into novel sustainable materials, enhancing the transferability of successful restoration techniques across different ecosystems, and strengthening international collaboration on clean technologies and sustainable resource management.​  

# 9. Challenges and Future Directions  

Achieving a widespread transition from virgin aggregate extraction towards more sustainable alternatives necessitates overcoming a multifaceted array of challenges spanning technological, economic, regulatory, and social domains. One of the most significant barriers impeding the broader adoption of innovative, lower-energy construction materials, including sustainable aggregates, is the inherent hesitancy and resistance from the traditional construction industry and its regulatory bodies. This preference for established, tried-and-tested materials over novel solutions hinders the market penetration of more environmentally benign options [26].  

Technological barriers present considerable hurdles. The performance characteristics of sustainable aggregates, such as recycled fine aggregates (RFA), may exhibit slight reductions in properties like compressive and flexural strengths compared to natural aggregates in certain applications, necessitating further research for optimization and the development of innovative strategies for improvement [11]. The shear behavior of recycled aggregates, for instance, requires further investigation into the influence of factors like grading, particle size, and uniformity coefficient beyond just particle shape [17]. Furthermore, the development and implementation of low-emission processes and technologies, crucial for reducing the environmental footprint of aggregate production and use, face significant cost challenges [2]. In specific contexts like deep-sea mining, limited technological capacity exists to adequately minimize harm to ecosystems [7].​  

Economic constraints are intrinsically linked to technological adoption. The high costs associated with implementing lowemission processes pose a challenge, particularly in price-sensitive commodity markets such as cement, which relies heavily on aggregates [2]. Balancing the necessary investment in environmental monitoring with budget limitations is also a persistent issue [5]. Financial and technical support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) within the mining sector is needed to enhance their environmental management and resource utilization capabilities [19]. Moreover, resolving the conflict between economic development aspirations and the protection of environmental and cultural heritage, such as balancing the economic needs of local communities with the preservation of historical sites threatened by quarrying, requires careful consideration [24]. Incentives are necessary to drive a paradigm shift towards the adoption of renewable energy and technological upgrades across industries relevant to aggregate production and consumption [3,14].  

Regulatory hurdles and governance issues contribute significantly to the challenge landscape. Navigating the complex framework of existing regulations can be difficult [5]. There is a recognized need to strengthen ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) supervision within the mining industry, requiring the establishment of clear metrics, compliance baselines, standardized information disclosure, and robust third-party verification mechanisms [19]. Developing regulations for emerging areas like deep-sea mineral exploitation requires a transparent and consultative approach, clearly defining how environmental impacts, particularly biodiversity loss, will be measured, what levels of net loss are acceptable, and what compensation mechanisms will be put in place [7]. Furthermore, promoting sustainable practices necessitates enhancing ESG information disclosure quality and comparability, refining standards, and promoting supply chain collaboration [19]. The lack of a unified view on complex interconnected issues such as climate change, energy poverty, and environmental regulation underscores the complexity of the policy landscape [29].  

Social acceptance issues are interwoven with regulatory and economic factors. As noted, the hesitancy of the construction industry is a major impediment [26]. Balancing the needs and desires of local populations for economic prosperity with the imperative to protect historical heritage affected by extraction activities represents a critical social challenge [24]. Promoting public participation in oversight and community engagement in environmental monitoring efforts are identified as crucial aspects for the future [5,19]. Furthermore, fostering better coordination between local communities and environmental management agencies is vital for effective conservation and resource management [18].

Significant gaps exist in current knowledge, necessitating focused future research. Limited data on species and habitats hinder the assessment of ecological impacts and the effectiveness of conservation measures [12]. There are substantial gaps in ecological knowledge regarding complex ecosystems like the deep sea and uncertainties surrounding their recovery potential after disturbance [7]. A critical methodological gap is the lack of a widely accepted method for aggregating environmental hazards, especially when dealing with potentially correlated or interacting factors, posing challenges for comprehensive impact assessments [28].  

Based on these challenges and gaps, several key directions for future research emerge. There is a clear need for more comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) studies to fully understand the cradle-to-site environmental impacts of both virgin and sustainable aggregates. Specifically, research should quantify the environmental impact, including carbon footprint and energy consumption, of novel aggregate materials like Sururu Shell Waste (SSA) when used as fine aggregate substitutes [8]. Improving monitoring and assessment techniques is paramount. This includes ensuring the accuracy and reliability of monitoring data [5], developing robust methods for aggregating cumulative environmental impacts [28], and integrating advanced technologies such as drones and artificial intelligence for real-time environmental monitoring [5,19]. Furthermore, enhancing databases, such as Multiregional Input-Output (MRIO) databases with more detailed sector and product classifications, is needed to enable more granular analysis of supply chains linked to environmental impacts, including extending analysis to cover aquatic biodiversity [10].  

Innovative approaches to mitigation and management are also critical areas for research and development. This includes exploring techniques to accelerate mineral dissolution rates for leveraging mining waste in carbon dioxide removal strategies, potentially using CO2-rich fluids, heat, acids, or microbial processes [9]. Developing innovative and cost-effective rehabilitation techniques for degraded lands, such as quarry sites with complex challenges like unstable water levels and geological risks, is essential [6,15]. Research into the long-term environmental impacts of aggregate extraction and the effectiveness of different restoration strategies is explicitly needed. This includes long-term monitoring of ecological recovery at rehabilitated sites [6] and assessing the sustainability of implemented strategies.​  

Potential interdisciplinary research opportunities are abundant and necessary for holistic solutions. Integrating ecological, economic, and social considerations into decision-making processes is crucial for sustainable resource management [13]. This involves incorporating ecosystem services supply and demand perspectives into landscape management [18], fostering better coordination between diverse stakeholders like local communities and management agencies [18], and addressing the complex interplay between economic growth, environmental impact, and social well-being, particularly in balancing development with heritage protection [24]. Coordinated efforts across entire economic sectors, such as transforming both the energy and industrial sectors simultaneously, are needed to achieve low-carbon futures [2]. Collaboration and partnerships across different entities are also highlighted as key for effective environmental monitoring and sustainable practices [5,19]. Finally, given the global nature of environmental challenges like biodiversity loss, international cooperation remains a critical component of future efforts [7,20].​  

# 10. Conclusion  

The comprehensive analysis presented in this survey underscores the significant environmental impacts associated with the extraction and utilization of virgin aggregates. These impacts span various domains, including land degradation, habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, and substantial carbon emissions [7,20]. Addressing these multifaceted environmental  

challenges necessitates a fundamental transition towards more sustainable practices within the construction and mining sectors [2,19,20].  

Mitigation strategies and the adoption of sustainable alternatives offer viable pathways to reduce reliance on virgin aggregates and lessen their environmental footprint. Ecological restoration of degraded quarry sites, as demonstrated by projects transforming desolate areas into functional landscapes and wetland habitats, presents significant opportunities for environmental recovery and biodiversity promotion [6,23]. Furthermore, integrating vegetation, such as strategically placed grass strips, can effectively mitigate soil erosion associated with land disturbance.  

The increased use of recycled and waste materials as aggregate substitutes is crucial. Recycled fine aggregates from construction waste have demonstrated suitability for applications like eco-friendly 3D printing, although optimization of mix designs is necessary to balance sustainability with mechanical performance. Recycled aggregate sand can exhibit better shear strength and liquefaction resistance compared to traditional quartz sand, making it a viable option for foundation engineering. Industrial waste streams, such as Sururu shells, show potential as fine aggregate in mortar, though further research on durability and comprehensive environmental impact is required. Beyond aggregate substitution, broader industry-wide carbon reduction initiatives, including enhanced weathering of mine tailings, collaboration, and the adoption of low-carbon technologies, are essential for achieving net-zero ambitions [2].​  

Despite the proven potential of sustainable alternatives, significant barriers to widespread adoption persist, including limited acceptance within the traditional construction industry. Overcoming these barriers requires concerted efforts in research, policy, and industry collaboration. Continuous environmental monitoring is vital within the mining industry to ensure regulatory compliance, manage risks effectively, and track progress towards sustainability goals. The development of novel instruments, particularly utilizing remote sensing data, is necessary for accurately assessing and monitoring the extent and severity of land degradation. Standardized tools, such as life cycle assessment templates, can also facilitate the evaluation of the environmental impacts of alternative materials and practices.​  

Policy interventions are paramount to accelerating the transition. Policies should be designed to promote structural change, attract investment in green technologies, foster technological innovation, and incentivize the consumption of renewable energy, all of which are crucial for reducing carbon emissions [3]. Regulatory frameworks need strengthening, particularly regarding Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in the mining sector, to ensure responsible practices and improve disclosure [19]. Furthermore, environmental regulations should consider addressing cumulative environmental hazards and inequalities, potentially through measures like integrated source reduction and the placement of green infrastructure in vulnerable communities. Spatial prioritization maps can serve as valuable tools for guiding impact avoidance and sustainable resource management, including marine environments. Considering the moderating role of environmental regulation between climate change and energy poverty is also an important dimension for comprehensive policy design.  

Recommendations for future research include rigorous comparative studies assessing the long-term durability and full life cycle environmental impacts of alternative aggregate materials and concrete formulations, such as geopolymer concrete. Further investigation into optimizing the performance of recycled aggregates in various applications, like 3D printing, is also needed. Research should continue to explore innovative monitoring techniques and assessment tools for land degradation and ecosystem health. Understanding the complex interplay between economic factors, technological advancements, and environmental outcomes remains a critical area for future study [3]. Finally, research exploring effective policy mechanisms to incentivize sustainable practices and overcome industry inertia is essential.​  

Ultimately, promoting a more circular and environmentally responsible construction sector requires a holistic approach tha integrates environmental protection with economic viability and social equity. Policymakers must create enabling frameworks, industry stakeholders must embrace innovation and collaborate on sustainable practices, and researchers must continue to provide the evidence base and technical solutions necessary to accelerate the adoption of sustainable aggregates and minimize the environmental burden of construction activities. Protecting biodiversity and ecosystems is fundamental to protecting humanity and ensuring a sustainable future [20].​
