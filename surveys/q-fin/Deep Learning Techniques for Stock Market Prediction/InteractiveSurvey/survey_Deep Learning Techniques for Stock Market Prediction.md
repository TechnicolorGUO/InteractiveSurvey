# 2 Introduction
The stock market is a complex and dynamic system influenced by a myriad of factors, including economic indicators, company performance, political events, and investor sentiment [1]. Accurate stock price prediction is crucial for investors, financial analysts, and policymakers, as it can inform strategic decisions and mitigate risks [2]. Traditional approaches to stock price prediction, such as technical and fundamental analysis, have been widely used but often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of factors that influence market dynamics [3]. With the advent of deep learning, there has been a significant shift towards more sophisticated and data-driven methods that can handle the complexity and non-linearity of financial data [4]. Deep learning models, particularly those that integrate diverse data sources and advanced neural network architectures, have shown promising results in enhancing the accuracy and robustness of stock price predictions [5].

This survey paper focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for stock market prediction, with a particular emphasis on hybrid models that leverage multiple data sources and advanced neural network architectures [6]. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in this field, highlighting the latest research trends, methodologies, and practical applications. We explore how deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are being used to enhance stock price prediction [7]. Additionally, we discuss the integration of diverse data sources, including macroeconomic indicators, news articles, social media sentiment, and alternative data, to build more comprehensive and accurate predictive models.

One of the key areas covered in this survey is the development of hybrid deep learning models that combine the strengths of different architectures to address the unique challenges of stock market prediction [6]. For instance, models that integrate CNNs and LSTMs can effectively process and integrate heterogeneous data types, extracting complex patterns and relationships that are not apparent in traditional models. The paper also delves into the use of advanced techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, attention mechanisms, and synthetic data generation to optimize the performance of deep learning models. These techniques are crucial for handling the high dimensionality and non-stationarity of financial data, ensuring that the models are robust and reliable in real-world applications.

Another important aspect discussed in this survey is the practical evaluation of deep learning models through trading simulations. Trading simulations provide a practical assessment of the model's performance in a simulated trading environment, allowing researchers to evaluate not only the accuracy of the predictions but also their potential economic value. The paper reviews various methods for validating the effectiveness of deep learning models, including the use of performance metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and cumulative returns. These metrics offer a comprehensive view of the model's profitability and risk profile, providing valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners.

The contributions of this survey paper are multifaceted. First, it provides a detailed review of the latest research in deep learning for stock market prediction, covering a wide range of topics from data integration and model architecture to optimization techniques and practical evaluation [1]. Second, it highlights the key challenges and opportunities in this field, offering insights into the future directions of research. Finally, it serves as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in the intersection of deep learning and financial market prediction, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and innovation in this exciting and rapidly evolving domain [8].

# 3 Hybrid Deep Learning Models for Stock Price Prediction

## 3.1 Graph-based and Multi-source Models

### 3.1.1 Leveraging Diverse Data Sources for Enhanced Prediction
Leveraging diverse data sources has emerged as a critical approach to enhancing the accuracy and robustness of stock price predictions. Traditional models, such as those based on technical and fundamental analysis, often rely on historical price data and company financial statements, which can be limiting in capturing the full spectrum of factors influencing stock prices. By integrating a broader range of data sources, including macroeconomic indicators, news articles, social media sentiment, and even weather data, predictive models can better account for the multifaceted nature of market dynamics. For instance, macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth rates, unemployment figures, and interest rates provide valuable context for understanding the broader economic environment in which companies operate, thereby influencing investor sentiment and market trends.

Incorporating textual data from news articles and social media platforms has also proven to be a valuable addition to predictive models. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as sentiment analysis, can extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data, helping to gauge public sentiment and market mood [9]. This is particularly useful in capturing real-time reactions to significant events, such as company announcements, political developments, or global crises, which can have immediate impacts on stock prices. Moreover, the integration of alternative data sources, such as satellite imagery and sensor data, can provide unique perspectives on company operations and industry trends. For example, satellite imagery can be used to monitor the activity levels of manufacturing plants or retail store foot traffic, offering early indicators of a company's performance.

To effectively leverage these diverse data sources, advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques are essential. Models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks can process and integrate heterogeneous data types, extracting complex patterns and relationships that are not apparent in traditional models. For instance, CNNs can be used to analyze spatial data, such as satellite images, while LSTMs can capture temporal dependencies in time series data, such as stock prices and news sentiment over time. By combining these models, it is possible to build more comprehensive and accurate predictive frameworks that can adapt to the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the stock market.

### 3.1.2 Integration of Background Information in Experimental Setup
The integration of background information into the experimental setup is crucial for enhancing the predictive power and robustness of financial forecasting models. In the context of stock price prediction, background information can encompass a wide range of data, including macroeconomic indicators, company-specific financial reports, news articles, and social media sentiment. This information is often heterogeneous and high-dimensional, requiring sophisticated methods to effectively incorporate it into the model. For instance, macroeconomic data such as GDP growth rates, inflation rates, and unemployment figures can provide a broader context for market trends, while company-specific data like earnings reports and management changes can offer insights into individual stock performance.

To integrate this diverse background information, researchers have employed various techniques, including feature engineering, multi-modal learning, and hybrid models. Feature engineering involves the manual selection and transformation of relevant features from background data to align with the model's input requirements. Multi-modal learning, on the other hand, leverages deep learning architectures capable of processing multiple types of data simultaneously, such as combining textual data from news articles with numerical data from financial reports. Hybrid models, such as the Attention-based CNN-LSTM and XGBoost (AttCLX) model, integrate different machine learning techniques to leverage the strengths of each, thereby improving the model's ability to capture complex patterns and dependencies in the data [6].

The experimental setup must also account for the temporal dynamics of background information, as the relevance and impact of certain factors can vary over time. For example, during economic crises, macroeconomic indicators may become more significant, while in stable periods, company-specific news might play a more prominent role. To address this, models can be designed to dynamically adjust the weight of different background factors based on their current relevance. This adaptive approach ensures that the model remains responsive to changing market conditions, thereby enhancing its predictive accuracy and reliability. Additionally, the integration of background information can be validated through extensive experiments, where the model's performance is compared with and without the inclusion of such data, providing empirical evidence of its added value.

### 3.1.3 Validation Through Trading Simulations
Validation through trading simulations is a critical step in the evaluation of stock price prediction models, as it provides a practical assessment of the model's performance in a simulated trading environment. This method involves the use of historical data to simulate trades based on the predictions generated by the model, allowing researchers to assess not only the accuracy of the predictions but also their potential economic value. The primary goal is to determine whether the model can generate profitable trading signals under realistic market conditions, taking into account factors such as transaction costs and market liquidity. Trading simulations are particularly useful for evaluating the robustness of a model over different market conditions, as they can be conducted over various historical periods, including both bull and bear markets.

In the context of deep learning models, trading simulations often employ walk-forward validation techniques, which are designed to mimic the real-world application of a model. This approach involves dividing the dataset into a series of training and testing periods, where the model is trained on past data and then tested on a subsequent period. The sliding window method, a variant of walk-forward validation, is particularly suitable for stock price prediction due to its ability to maintain the recency of the data used for training. This method ensures that the model is continuously updated with the most recent market information, which is crucial for capturing the dynamic and non-stationary nature of financial markets. By simulating trades over these testing periods, researchers can evaluate the model's ability to adapt to changing market conditions and its potential for generating consistent returns.

The results of trading simulations are typically evaluated using a combination of performance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and cumulative returns. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's profitability and risk profile, allowing for a more nuanced assessment of its practical utility. Additionally, the simulation results can be used to identify specific market conditions or patterns where the model performs particularly well or poorly, which can inform further model refinement and feature selection. Overall, trading simulations serve as a bridge between theoretical model development and practical application, ensuring that the predictive models are not only accurate but also economically viable in the context of real-world trading.

## 3.2 Temporal and Hybrid Neural Networks

### 3.2.1 Optimizing LSTM and GRU Models with Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimizing LSTM and GRU models through hyperparameter tuning is crucial for enhancing their predictive performance in stock price forecasting [10]. Hyperparameters such as the learning rate, number of neurons per layer, batch sizes, number of layers, and optimizers play a significant role in the model's ability to generalize and minimize prediction errors [11]. The learning rate, for instance, controls the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function, and an optimal learning rate can prevent the model from either converging too slowly or overshooting the minimum. Similarly, the number of neurons per layer affects the model's capacity to capture complex patterns in the data; too few neurons can lead to underfitting, while too many can cause overfitting.

To systematically explore the vast hyperparameter space, techniques like Tree-Structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) Bayesian optimization are employed. TPE Bayesian optimization is a sequential model-based optimization method that builds probabilistic models of the objective function to efficiently search for the best hyperparameters. It iteratively selects promising hyperparameters by balancing exploration and exploitation, thereby reducing the computational cost compared to grid search or random search. By applying TPE Bayesian optimization, researchers can identify the optimal configuration of hyperparameters that maximizes the model's performance metrics, such as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and \( R^2 \) score.

In practice, the optimization process involves setting up a validation set to evaluate the performance of the model with different hyperparameter settings. The validation set helps in avoiding overfitting to the training data and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Once the optimal hyperparameters are identified, the final model is trained on the entire training dataset and evaluated on a separate test set to assess its real-world performance. This rigorous approach to hyperparameter tuning not only improves the accuracy of LSTM and GRU models but also enhances their robustness and reliability in dynamic financial markets.

### 3.2.2 Combining Political Signals with Advanced Machine Learning
Combining political signals with advanced machine learning techniques represents a novel and promising approach to enhancing stock market prediction models [12]. Traditional financial models often overlook the significant impact of political events and policies on market dynamics. By integrating political signals, such as election outcomes, policy changes, and geopolitical tensions, these models can better capture the multifaceted nature of stock market movements. Advanced machine learning, particularly deep learning architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are well-suited to process and analyze the complex, non-linear relationships between political events and stock prices [8]. These models can identify patterns and correlations that are not easily discernible through traditional statistical methods, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of stock market predictions.

The integration of political signals into machine learning models involves several key steps. First, a comprehensive dataset of political events and their associated impacts on the stock market is compiled. This dataset includes a wide range of sources, such as news articles, social media posts, and economic reports, which are preprocessed and structured for machine learning. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed to extract relevant information and sentiment from textual data, which is then combined with numerical financial data [13]. The use of large language models (LLMs) can further enhance this process by generating detailed reports on the potential economic impacts of political events. These reports serve as additional input features for the machine learning models, enriching the data and providing a more nuanced understanding of market dynamics.

To evaluate the effectiveness of combining political signals with advanced machine learning, extensive experiments are conducted using a variety of deep learning architectures. The models are trained and tested on historical stock market data, with political signals integrated at different stages of the prediction process. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of political signals significantly improves the predictive accuracy of the models, particularly in the context of high-impact political events such as elections and policy announcements. This approach not only enhances the overall performance of the models but also provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between politics and the stock market, opening new avenues for research and practical applications in financial forecasting.

### 3.2.3 Utilizing Vision-Language Models for Granular Market Change Prediction
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in the domain of granular market change prediction, leveraging the synergistic capabilities of visual and textual data to enhance predictive accuracy. These models integrate deep learning architectures designed for image and text processing, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, to analyze complex financial datasets [2]. By incorporating visual elements, such as stock charts and financial news images, alongside textual data from news articles and social media, VLMs can capture nuanced patterns that traditional numerical models might overlook. This multimodal approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of market dynamics, enabling more precise predictions of short-term price movements and long-term trends.

The integration of VLMs in market prediction involves preprocessing steps that align visual and textual data, ensuring that the model can effectively learn from both modalities. For instance, stock charts are processed using CNNs to extract temporal and spatial features, while textual data is analyzed using Transformers to understand sentiment and contextual information. The combined features are then fed into a unified deep learning framework, which can dynamically adjust its focus between visual and textual inputs based on their relevance to the prediction task. This adaptability is crucial in volatile markets, where the importance of different data types can vary rapidly. Moreover, the use of attention mechanisms within VLMs allows the model to weigh the significance of various inputs, further refining its predictive capabilities.

Empirical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of VLMs in enhancing market prediction accuracy. For example, models that incorporate both visual and textual data have shown superior performance in forecasting stock price movements compared to models that rely solely on numerical data. The ability of VLMs to handle large volumes of diverse data in real-time makes them particularly suitable for high-frequency trading environments. Additionally, the interpretability of VLMs, facilitated by attention maps and feature visualization techniques, provides valuable insights into the factors driving market changes. This transparency is essential for building trust among financial analysts and investors, who can use these insights to make more informed decisions. Overall, the utilization of VLMs represents a significant advancement in the field of financial market prediction, offering a robust and versatile approach to capturing and analyzing the multifaceted nature of market dynamics.

## 3.3 Deep Learning for Intraday and Long-term Forecasting

### 3.3.1 Informer Model for Efficient Real-time Prediction
The Informer model, an advanced variant of the Transformer architecture, has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing the challenges of real-time prediction in the stock market, particularly for long sequence data [10]. Unlike traditional models that struggle with the computational complexity and memory requirements of processing long sequences, the Informer model optimizes these aspects through a series of innovative mechanisms. One of the key innovations is the ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which significantly reduces the computational complexity from \(O(L^2)\) to \(O(L \log L)\), where \(L\) is the sequence length. This reduction is crucial for real-time applications, as it allows the model to handle sequences of up to 4096 time steps efficiently, making it particularly suitable for high-frequency trading scenarios where minute-level predictions are essential.

In addition to the ProbSparse self-attention, the Informer model incorporates a generative autoregressive decoder that further enhances its predictive capabilities. This decoder allows the model to generate predictions in a sequential manner, which is beneficial for forecasting tasks that require multiple steps ahead. The combination of the ProbSparse self-attention and the generative decoder not only accelerates the prediction process but also improves the accuracy of the forecasts, especially in volatile and rapidly changing markets. The Informer model's ability to capture long-term dependencies and patterns in the data, without the typical computational overhead, makes it a valuable asset in the arsenal of financial analysts and traders.

Moreover, the Informer model's effectiveness in real-time prediction is further bolstered by its robust handling of noisy and sparse data, which is common in financial datasets. The model's architecture includes a series of encoder and decoder layers that are designed to filter out irrelevant information and focus on the most salient features of the time series. This feature is particularly important in the stock market, where data can be highly erratic and influenced by a myriad of external factors. By efficiently processing and interpreting large volumes of data, the Informer model provides a more reliable and accurate prediction framework, thereby enhancing the decision-making process for investors and traders.

### 3.3.2 Analyzing Economic Conditions Through Time Series Analysis
Analyzing economic conditions through time series analysis involves leveraging historical data to forecast future trends, particularly in financial markets [14]. Time series analysis is pivotal in understanding the dynamics of stock prices, which are influenced by a multitude of factors including macroeconomic indicators, market sentiment, and geopolitical events [14]. Techniques such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models are widely used for their ability to capture trends, seasonal patterns, and cyclical variations in the data [15]. ARIMA models are particularly effective when the data is stationary or can be transformed to stationarity through differencing. The process involves identifying the appropriate parameters (p, d, q) for the autoregressive, differencing, and moving average components, respectively, by analyzing the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots.

However, traditional ARIMA models face limitations in handling non-linear relationships and high-frequency data, which are common in financial time series. To address these challenges, advanced techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units have been increasingly adopted [15]. LSTMs are capable of capturing long-term dependencies in the data, making them suitable for forecasting stock prices over extended periods [10]. These models can integrate multiple data sources, including technical indicators, news sentiment, and economic reports, to enhance predictive accuracy. Despite their complexity, LSTMs have shown promising results in outperforming traditional models, especially in scenarios with large datasets and complex temporal dynamics [10].

In addition to these advanced models, hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both statistical and machine learning methods have gained popularity. For instance, integrating ARIMA with neural networks can leverage the former's ability to handle linear trends and the latter's capacity to model non-linear relationships. This hybrid approach often involves preprocessing the data with ARIMA to stabilize the time series, followed by feeding the residuals into a neural network for further refinement. Such a combination not only improves the robustness of the predictions but also provides a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying economic conditions. The effectiveness of these models is continually being evaluated and refined, contributing to the evolving landscape of financial time series analysis.

### 3.3.3 Image Processing Techniques for Trading Strategies
Image processing techniques have emerged as a novel approach in the domain of trading strategies, particularly for short-term stock price prediction. These techniques leverage the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to transform and analyze time-series stock price data as images [8]. By converting stock price sequences into two-dimensional matrices, researchers can apply image recognition algorithms to identify complex patterns and trends that are not easily discernible through traditional numerical analysis. This transformation allows for the extraction of multi-scale temporal features, which are crucial for capturing both short-term fluctuations and long-term dependencies in stock prices.

One significant application of image processing in trading strategies involves the creation of semantic segmentation masks that correspond to the predicted up/down trends of future stock prices. These masks are generated by training deep convolutional networks on historical price data represented as images. The networks learn to segment the input images into regions that indicate potential upward or downward movements in stock prices. This method has shown promising results in improving the accuracy of stock trend predictions, especially when combined with other machine learning techniques such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers [16]. The integration of these models helps in handling the sequential nature of stock price data while maintaining the spatial relationships captured by the image processing techniques.

Moreover, the use of image processing in trading strategies extends beyond simple trend prediction. Researchers have developed advanced models that incorporate multiple price frames to capture both short-term and long-term market dynamics. These models often employ a combination of downsampling and upsampling layers to extract deep coarse feature maps from consecutive price frames, which are then refined to produce high-resolution predictions [8]. This approach not only enhances the predictive accuracy but also provides valuable insights into the underlying market structure, enabling traders to make more informed and timely investment decisions. The effectiveness of these techniques underscores the potential of image processing in revolutionizing the field of quantitative finance and trading strategies.

# 4 Meta-Learning and Synthetic Data for Financial Forecasting

## 4.1 Advanced Deep Learning Models and Techniques

### 4.1.1 Crossformer and Stock Code Embedding for Asset Return Prediction
In the realm of asset return prediction, the Crossformer and stock code embedding have emerged as powerful tools for capturing both temporal and inter-stock relationships, enhancing the accuracy of financial forecasting models. The Crossformer, a variant of the transformer architecture, is specifically designed to handle long-range dependencies and high-dimensional time series data, which are prevalent in financial markets. By leveraging self-attention mechanisms, the Crossformer can effectively model the temporal dynamics of stock prices, allowing it to capture intricate patterns and trends that are often missed by traditional time series models. This capability is crucial for predicting asset returns, as financial markets are characterized by non-stationary and highly volatile data.

To further enhance the predictive power of the model, stock code embedding is employed to represent individual stocks in a high-dimensional vector space. This embedding captures the unique characteristics and historical performance of each stock, providing a richer representation that can be used to inform the prediction process. The stock code embedding network is trained to map stock identifiers into a dense vector space, where each dimension encodes specific features such as market capitalization, sector, and past performance [2]. This approach allows the model to leverage inter-stock relationships, which are essential for understanding market dynamics and making informed predictions. By combining the outputs of the Crossformer and the stock code embedding network, the model can better account for both the temporal and cross-sectional aspects of stock returns.

The fusion network, which integrates the outputs from the Crossformer and the stock code embedding, plays a critical role in generating the final predictions [2]. This network is designed to combine the temporal features extracted by the Crossformer with the stock-specific features provided by the code embedding, creating a comprehensive representation of the input data. The fusion network then processes this combined representation to predict the dynamic return distributions of stocks, which is a more nuanced and informative output compared to point predictions [2]. This approach not only improves the accuracy of the predictions but also provides insights into the uncertainty and variability of stock returns, making it a valuable tool for risk management and portfolio optimization in quantitative finance.

### 4.1.2 Sampling Methods and Attention Mechanisms for Imbalanced Data
In addressing the challenge of imbalanced data in financial datasets, various sampling methods and attention mechanisms have been explored to enhance model performance. Sampling methods, such as oversampling, undersampling, and hybrid approaches, aim to balance the distribution of classes by either increasing the representation of minority classes or reducing the majority class instances. Oversampling techniques, like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), generate synthetic samples for the minority class, while undersampling methods, such as Tomek links, remove instances from the majority class to reduce dominance. Hybrid methods combine both strategies to achieve a balanced dataset. These techniques are crucial in financial applications, where rare events, such as extreme market movements or fraudulent transactions, are often of primary interest but are underrepresented in the data.

Attention mechanisms, on the other hand, focus on improving the model's ability to weigh the importance of different features or time steps in sequence data. In the context of financial time series, attention mechanisms can help the model focus on critical periods or features that are more indicative of future trends or anomalies. For instance, self-attention mechanisms, as used in transformers, allow the model to dynamically assign weights to different parts of the input sequence, enabling it to capture long-term dependencies and subtle patterns that might be missed by traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). By integrating attention mechanisms with sampling techniques, models can better handle the temporal and feature imbalances present in financial data, leading to improved predictive accuracy and robustness.

To evaluate the effectiveness of these methods, a systematic approach is employed, involving the application of different sampling techniques and attention mechanisms to a variety of deep learning models, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks and transformers. The performance of these models is assessed using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) on both synthetic and real-world financial datasets. Additionally, the impact of sampling and attention on model interpretability is analyzed using techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, which provide insights into the contribution of individual features to the model's predictions. This comprehensive evaluation helps identify the most effective combinations of sampling and attention mechanisms for handling imbalanced financial data, ultimately contributing to more reliable and interpretable financial models.

### 4.1.3 Large Language Models for Time Series Analysis
Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for time series analysis, particularly in financial forecasting, where they can augment traditional econometric and machine learning methods. These models, such as GPT-3.5-Turbo, Falcon, and PaLM, are capable of generating high-quality synthetic financial data, which can be used to overcome the limitations of real-world datasets, such as data scarcity and noise. By leveraging the vast knowledge and generative capabilities of LLMs, researchers can create synthetic time series that closely mimic real financial data, thereby improving the robustness and generalization of predictive models [4]. For instance, the integration of LLMs with generative models like Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) can help in generating synthetic stock prices and market indicators, which can be used to train deep learning models for tasks such as stock return prediction and market trend analysis.

The application of LLMs in time series analysis is not limited to data generation; they can also be used for feature extraction and alpha factor discovery. In the context of stock market prediction, LLMs can be employed to extract relevant features from unstructured data sources, such as news articles, social media posts, and financial reports. These features can then be integrated with traditional time series data to enhance the predictive power of models. For example, hierarchical temporal attention mechanisms and cross-modal attention fusion, as proposed by Sawhney et al., can be used to align textual and numerical data, thereby capturing the impact of market events and news on stock prices. Additionally, LLMs can assist in the discovery of new alpha factors by analyzing a wide range of data sources and identifying patterns that are not easily discernible through conventional methods.

Despite the potential benefits, the use of LLMs in time series analysis also presents several challenges. One of the primary concerns is the computational cost associated with training and deploying these models, especially when dealing with large-scale financial datasets. Moreover, the interpretability of LLMs remains a significant issue, as their complex internal structures can make it difficult to understand how specific predictions are made. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring techniques such as model distillation and explainable AI (XAI) to make LLMs more efficient and transparent. Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with domain-specific knowledge and expert systems can help in refining the generated features and predictions, thereby improving the overall performance of time series analysis models in financial applications.

## 4.2 Synthetic Data and Meta-Learning Approaches

### 4.2.1 Enhancing Model Performance with Synthetic Data Generation
Synthetic data generation plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance of deep learning models, particularly in the context of financial market prediction, where the availability of large, high-quality datasets is often limited [4]. By leveraging advanced generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), researchers can create synthetic financial time series data that closely mimics the statistical properties of real-world data [17]. This synthetic data not only augments the training dataset but also introduces variability and complexity, which are essential for improving the model's generalization capabilities.

The process of generating synthetic financial data involves several key steps [4]. First, the generative model is trained on a limited set of real financial data to learn the underlying distributions and patterns. Once trained, the model can generate new data points that exhibit similar characteristics to the original dataset. These synthetic data points are then used to augment the training set, allowing the predictive model to learn from a more extensive and diverse dataset. This augmentation is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the real data is scarce or imbalanced, as it helps to mitigate overfitting and improves the model's robustness to different market conditions.

Moreover, the use of synthetic data in financial modeling offers additional advantages beyond data augmentation. It enables researchers to conduct controlled experiments by introducing specific anomalies or market conditions that may not be present in the real data. This capability is invaluable for stress testing and validating the model's performance under various hypothetical scenarios. Additionally, synthetic data generation can help address privacy concerns associated with using real financial data, as the synthetic data does not contain personally identifiable information. Overall, the integration of synthetic data generation techniques into the model training pipeline represents a significant advancement in the field of financial deep learning, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of predictive models [4].

### 4.2.2 Dynamic Strategy Optimization Using Large Language Models
Dynamic strategy optimization in financial markets, particularly in the context of stock trading, involves continuously refining trading strategies to adapt to changing market conditions. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for this purpose, offering a flexible and scalable approach to strategy optimization. By leveraging the vast knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, these models can process and integrate a wide array of financial data, including historical prices, news articles, and economic indicators, to generate insightful and actionable trading signals. The key advantage of using LLMs lies in their ability to understand and contextualize complex financial information, which is crucial for identifying profitable trading opportunities and mitigating risks.

The process of dynamic strategy optimization using LLMs typically involves several stages. Initially, the LLM is trained on a diverse dataset that includes both structured and unstructured financial data. This training phase helps the model to develop a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics and the underlying factors that influence stock prices. Once the model is trained, it can be used to generate alpha factors, which are quantitative measures that predict the relative performance of stocks. These alpha factors are then evaluated and refined through back-testing on historical data to ensure their robustness and reliability. The multi-agent architecture within the LLM framework allows for the simultaneous exploration of multiple market scenarios, enabling the identification of optimal trading strategies that perform well across different market conditions.

Finally, the dynamic strategy optimization process is iterative, with continuous feedback loops that allow the LLM to adapt to new data and emerging market trends. This adaptability is crucial in the fast-paced and ever-changing financial markets, where the effectiveness of a trading strategy can diminish rapidly if not regularly updated. By integrating real-time data and market insights, LLMs can dynamically adjust trading strategies to maximize returns and minimize risks. Moreover, the interpretability of LLMs provides valuable insights into the decision-making process, allowing traders and portfolio managers to understand the rationale behind the recommended strategies and make informed adjustments as needed.

### 4.2.3 Evaluating Deep Learning Models for Financial Time Series
Evaluating deep learning models for financial time series involves a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique challenges of financial data, such as non-stationarity, high volatility, and the presence of noise [8]. Traditional metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are often used but may not fully capture the complexities of financial markets. For instance, these metrics treat all errors equally, regardless of the market conditions or the volatility of the stock. This can lead to models that perform well on average but fail during critical market events. To overcome this, researchers have proposed incorporating volatility-weighted metrics that assign higher penalties to errors during periods of high market volatility, thereby ensuring that the model's performance is robust across different market conditions.

Moreover, the evaluation of deep learning models in financial time series forecasting must consider the dynamic nature of financial markets [1]. Models need to be evaluated not only on historical data but also on their ability to generalize to unseen market conditions. This is particularly important for sub-new stocks, which are often more volatile and less predictable than established stocks. Meta-learning approaches, such as the Reptile algorithm, have been proposed to enhance the model's ability to adapt to new and diverse market scenarios. By constructing meta-learning tasks that incorporate both old and sub-new stocks, these models can learn to generalize more effectively, improving their predictive accuracy and robustness [18]. The adaptive learning strategy, which assigns weights to tasks based on their difficulty, further refines the model's performance by focusing on the most challenging and volatile segments of the market.

Finally, the evaluation of deep learning models for financial time series should also consider the practical aspects of real-world deployment, such as computational efficiency and interpretability [11]. While deep learning models can achieve high accuracy, they often require significant computational resources and may be difficult to interpret, which can be a barrier to their adoption in financial institutions [4]. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate models not only on their predictive performance but also on their computational efficiency and the interpretability of their outputs. Techniques such as pruning, quantization, and the use of attention mechanisms can help to balance these trade-offs, making deep learning models more suitable for real-time financial applications [4].

## 4.3 Robustness and Adaptability in Financial Forecasting

### 4.3.1 Robustness Certificates for Streaming Models
In the context of streaming models, robustness certificates play a critical role in ensuring that the model's predictions remain reliable and consistent even when faced with adversarial attacks or data perturbations. The streaming setting is particularly challenging due to the sequential nature of the data, where inputs are presented as a potentially infinite sequence of correlated items. To address this, we derive robustness guarantees that provide bounds on the average model performance over long data streams. Our approach involves defining a threat model where a man-in-the-middle adversary can manipulate the data stream, and we aim to certify the model's performance under such adversarial conditions [19].

Our robustness certificate is designed for streaming models that use a fixed-sized sliding window over the data stream to make predictions [19]. This sliding window approach ensures that the model only considers a limited, recent segment of the data at any given time step, which is crucial for maintaining computational efficiency and responsiveness to recent changes in the data. The certificate provides a theoretical upper bound on the model's performance degradation due to adversarial perturbations, which is independent of the length of the stream but depends on the window size and the average perturbation size. This dependency highlights the importance of window size in determining the model's robustness; smaller window sizes are generally more robust to adversarial attacks, as they limit the impact of perturbations on the model's predictions.

To validate the effectiveness of our robustness certificate, we conduct extensive experiments using a variety of deep learning architectures, including convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based models. These experiments demonstrate that the certificate accurately predicts the model's performance under adversarial conditions, providing a reliable measure of robustness. Furthermore, we show that the certificate can be applied to different types of streaming data, such as financial time series and sensor data, making it a versatile tool for ensuring the reliability of streaming models in real-world applications. The results also highlight the trade-offs between window size, computational efficiency, and robustness, offering valuable insights for practitioners and researchers designing streaming models for deployment in adversarial environments [19].

### 4.3.2 Task-Difficulty-Adaptive Meta-Learning for Sub-New Stock Prediction
In the realm of financial market prediction, the challenge of forecasting sub-new stock prices is exacerbated by the scarcity of historical data, which is a critical input for training predictive models [15]. To address this issue, we propose a task-difficulty-adaptive meta-learning model, Meta-Stock, which leverages the wealth of data available from old stock price prediction tasks to enhance the generalization capabilities of the model for sub-new stocks [18]. Meta-Stock employs a meta-learning framework where the model is trained across a diverse set of old stock prediction tasks, each characterized by varying levels of difficulty [18]. This approach not only enriches the model's ability to generalize but also equips it with the flexibility to adapt to the unique characteristics of sub-new stocks, thereby mitigating the impact of data scarcity.

The core innovation of Meta-Stock lies in its adaptive learning strategy, which dynamically adjusts the learning process based on the difficulty of each prediction task. The difficulty of a task is quantified through a combination of metrics, including the volatility of the stock, the length of the historical data available, and the complexity of the market conditions during the period of interest. By incorporating this task difficulty into the meta-learning process, Meta-Stock can prioritize the learning of more challenging tasks, which are likely to provide more valuable insights and improve the model's robustness. This adaptive mechanism ensures that the model is not only trained on a broad range of tasks but also focuses on the most informative and challenging ones, leading to a more refined and adaptable predictive model.

To implement the task-difficulty-adaptive meta-learning, Meta-Stock employs an outer-loop and an inner-loop training mechanism [18]. In the outer loop, the model is initialized with parameters that are optimized to perform well across a variety of tasks, with a particular emphasis on those with higher difficulty. In the inner loop, the model is fine-tuned on individual tasks, allowing it to adapt to the specific characteristics of each sub-new stock. This two-loop structure enables Meta-Stock to balance the generalization capabilities learned from old stock tasks with the specific adaptations required for sub-new stocks, ultimately leading to more accurate and reliable predictions. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in prediction accuracy for sub-new stocks compared to traditional models.

### 4.3.3 Generating Financial Time Series Data for Improved Signal-to-Noise Ratio
Generating financial time series data with an improved signal-to-noise ratio is a critical task in the field of quantitative finance, particularly for stock market prediction. Traditional methods, such as linear regression and autoregressive models, often struggle to capture the complex and non-linear dynamics of financial markets, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address these limitations, advanced techniques like the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) have been employed to decompose financial time series into their constituent components, effectively separating the signal from the noise. DWT provides a multi-resolution analysis that captures both the long-term trends and short-term fluctuations, making it particularly useful for handling the volatility and non-stationarity inherent in financial data.

One of the key challenges in generating synthetic financial data is the need to replicate the intricate patterns and correlations observed in real market data [4]. This is especially important for sub-new stocks, which often have limited historical data and exhibit unique price dynamics. To overcome this, two innovative methods have been proposed: the first involves using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create synthetic data that closely mimics the statistical properties of real stock prices [3]. GANs can generate high-quality synthetic time series by learning the underlying distribution of the data, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio. The second method leverages variational autoencoders (VAEs) to model the latent factors driving stock price movements [20]. By encoding the temporal dependencies and volatility characteristics, VAEs can produce synthetic data that not only captures the essential features of the market but also maintains the necessary level of variability.

These synthetic data generation techniques are particularly valuable in addressing the data scarcity issues prevalent in the stock market, especially for stocks with short listing times [4]. By augmenting the available data with high-quality synthetic samples, these methods can significantly improve the training of predictive models, leading to more accurate and robust forecasts. Moreover, the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio achieved through these techniques can help in identifying and exploiting alpha factors, which are critical for successful quantitative trading strategies. The application of these methods in the context of China’s A-share market, for instance, has shown promising results in improving the performance of stock prediction models, thereby addressing the unique challenges posed by this market.

# 5 Reinforcement Learning and Graph Neural Networks for Portfolio Management

## 5.1 Advanced Neural Network Architectures for Market Prediction

### 5.1.1 Temporal Distance-aware Recurrent Networks for Dynamic Relationships
Temporal Distance-aware Recurrent Networks (TDRNs) are designed to capture the dynamic relationships in financial time series data by integrating temporal distance awareness into recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures. Unlike traditional RNNs, which treat all past information equally, TDRNs assign varying weights to historical data points based on their temporal proximity to the current time step. This approach is particularly beneficial in financial markets, where the relevance of past data can decay over time, and recent events may have a more significant impact on future trends.

In TDRNs, the temporal distance is quantified using a distance metric that reflects the time elapsed between data points. This metric is then used to modulate the hidden state updates within the RNN, allowing the model to adaptively focus on more recent or relevant information. By incorporating this temporal awareness, TDRNs can better capture the evolving relationships between financial instruments, such as stocks, and their underlying market conditions. This is achieved through a combination of attention mechanisms and gated units, which enable the network to selectively attend to different time scales and filter out noise from less relevant historical data.

Furthermore, TDRNs are particularly suited for multi-frequency data, where different time scales (e.g., 5-minute, daily, and weekly) provide complementary information about market dynamics. By processing these multiple frequencies in parallel and then combining the outputs, TDRNs can effectively integrate short-term and long-term dependencies, leading to more accurate and robust predictions. This capability is crucial in financial applications, where the ability to capture both immediate market reactions and longer-term trends is essential for making informed trading decisions.

### 5.1.2 Deep Risk Model Combining GRU and GAT for Portfolio Optimization
In the realm of portfolio optimization, the integration of deep learning models has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing risk assessment and return maximization [16]. The Deep Risk Model, which combines Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), represents a significant advancement in this domain. GRUs are particularly adept at capturing temporal dependencies in financial time series data, making them ideal for modeling the dynamic nature of stock prices and market conditions. By integrating GRUs with GATs, the model leverages the strengths of both architectures to not only capture temporal patterns but also to understand the complex interdependencies among different stocks and market factors.

The GAT component of the model plays a crucial role in identifying and weighing the importance of various market factors and their interactions. Unlike traditional factor models that rely on pre-defined factors, the GAT dynamically learns the most relevant factors and their relationships from the data. This adaptability is crucial in a rapidly changing market environment, where the significance of different factors can vary over time. The attention mechanism within the GAT allows the model to focus on the most influential nodes (stocks or factors) in the graph, thereby improving the accuracy of risk assessments and portfolio construction. The combination of GRUs and GATs thus provides a comprehensive view of the market, enabling the model to make more informed decisions about asset allocation and risk management.

Empirical evaluations of the Deep Risk Model have demonstrated its superiority over traditional methods in terms of both risk reduction and return enhancement. The model's ability to dynamically adjust to new market conditions and extract meaningful patterns from high-dimensional data sets it apart from conventional approaches. By effectively combining temporal and relational information, the Deep Risk Model not only achieves lower portfolio volatility but also identifies high-growth potential stocks, contributing to higher cumulative returns. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning techniques in revolutionizing portfolio optimization and financial decision-making processes [1].

### 5.1.3 Quantum Gramian Angular Field for Enhanced Visualization
Quantum Gramian Angular Field (QGAF) represents a significant advancement in the visualization and analysis of time series data, particularly in the context of stock market prediction. Building upon the traditional Gramian Angular Field (GAF) technique, which transforms one-dimensional time series data into two-dimensional images, QGAF leverages the principles of quantum computing to enhance the representation and processing of these images. By encoding time series data into a quantum state, QGAF can exploit the superposition and entanglement properties of qubits to capture more intricate patterns and relationships within the data [21]. This quantum-enhanced representation not only preserves the temporal dependencies inherent in the original time series but also amplifies the discriminative features that are crucial for accurate forecasting.

The integration of QGAF with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offers a robust framework for analyzing and predicting stock market movements [21]. Unlike traditional GAF, which may suffer from information loss during the transformation process, QGAF ensures that the quantum-encoded images retain a higher fidelity of the original data. This is achieved through the use of quantum gates that manipulate the qubits to encode the time series data in a manner that is both efficient and information-rich [21]. When combined with a CNN, the QGAF-generated images serve as a powerful input for feature extraction, enabling the model to identify complex patterns and trends that might be overlooked by conventional methods. Empirical evaluations on real-world stock market datasets have demonstrated that QGAF, when integrated with a deep learning framework, outperforms classical GAF and other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness [1].

Moreover, the application of QGAF extends beyond mere visualization to include the enhancement of computational efficiency and scalability. The quantum nature of QGAF allows for parallel processing of multiple time series, which is particularly advantageous in high-frequency trading scenarios where rapid decision-making is critical. Additionally, the reduced dimensionality and enhanced feature representation provided by QGAF contribute to faster training times and lower computational costs, making it a viable solution for large-scale financial applications. As quantum computing technology continues to evolve, the potential of QGAF in financial analytics is expected to grow, offering new opportunities for innovation and improvement in stock market prediction and risk management.

## 5.2 Reinforcement Learning and Variational Autoencoders

### 5.2.1 Recurrent Variational Autoencoder for Latent Factor Extraction
The Recurrent Variational Autoencoder (RVRAE) is a powerful tool for latent factor extraction in financial time series data, particularly in the context of stock market prediction [20]. By integrating the temporal dependencies captured by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with the probabilistic framework of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), RVRAE is uniquely suited to model the complex, non-linear relationships inherent in financial data. The RNN component of the RVRAE is responsible for capturing the sequential nature of the data, allowing the model to understand the context and temporal dynamics of stock prices, trading volumes, and other relevant financial indicators [20]. This is crucial for accurately predicting future market movements, as it enables the model to account for the historical context of the data.

In the RVRAE framework, the VAE component plays a critical role in extracting latent factors that are not directly observable but are essential for understanding the underlying structure of the financial data. The VAE achieves this by encoding the input data into a lower-dimensional latent space, where the distribution of the latent variables is modeled using a probabilistic approach. This allows the model to capture the inherent uncertainty and variability in the financial data, which is particularly important for risk management and portfolio optimization. The latent factors extracted by the VAE can represent various aspects of the market, such as market sentiment, economic conditions, and company-specific factors, which are crucial for making informed investment decisions.

The combination of RNN and VAE in the RVRAE framework also facilitates the incorporation of external information, such as macroeconomic indicators and news events, into the model. This is achieved by conditioning the VAE on additional input data, which can provide valuable context and improve the model's predictive performance. The RVRAE is trained using a variational inference approach, where the model learns to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables given the observed data. This training process ensures that the model can effectively extract meaningful latent factors that are both temporally coherent and statistically significant, thereby enhancing its ability to predict future market trends and inform trading strategies.

### 5.2.2 Deep Learning Neural Network Traders with Asynchronous Market Simulators
Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) traders integrated with asynchronous market simulators represent a significant advancement in algorithmic trading, addressing the complexities of real-world financial markets [22]. These systems leverage deep neural architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to capture intricate patterns in market data. The asynchronous market simulator plays a crucial role by providing a realistic training environment that mimics the dynamic and non-deterministic nature of actual markets. This setup allows the DLNN trader to learn and adapt to various market conditions, enhancing its robustness and predictive accuracy.

The integration of asynchronous market simulators with DLNN traders enables the simulation of high-frequency trading scenarios, which are essential for testing and validating trading strategies under realistic market conditions [22]. Unlike traditional synchronous simulators, which assume a fixed and predictable market environment, asynchronous simulators account for the inherent delays and uncertainties present in real trading environments. This capability is particularly important for deep learning models, which require extensive and diverse training data to generalize effectively. By exposing the DLNN trader to a wide range of market dynamics, the simulator helps in refining the model's decision-making processes and improving its performance in live trading scenarios.

Moreover, the combination of DLNN traders with asynchronous market simulators facilitates the exploration of advanced reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, such as policy gradient methods, which are well-suited for continuous trading environments [22]. These methods optimize the trading policy directly by maximizing the expected cumulative reward, aligning closely with the objectives of financial trading. The asynchronous nature of the simulator ensures that the RL agent receives timely feedback, enabling it to adjust its actions in response to changing market conditions. This synergy between deep learning and reinforcement learning, supported by a realistic market simulation, represents a powerful approach to developing sophisticated and adaptive trading algorithms capable of outperforming traditional methods.

### 5.2.3 Deep Multi-factor Framework with Graph Attention Modules
In the proposed deep multi-factor framework, the integration of graph attention modules represents a significant advancement in leveraging multi-relational stock graphs for stock selection and factor identification [23]. This framework constructs a dynamic graph where stocks are nodes, and edges represent two types of relationships: industry-specific and universe-wide connections [23]. The industry-specific edges allow the model to capture the nuanced interactions within the same sector, which are crucial for understanding sector-specific trends and influences. Meanwhile, the universe-wide edges facilitate the learning of broader market dynamics, enabling the model to discern the impact of external factors on stock performance.

The graph attention modules are designed to summarize the industry and universe influences on each stock by aggregating information from neighboring nodes in a weighted manner [23]. This process is executed in two steps: a time-aware graph attention mechanism and a heterogeneous graph attention mechanism. The time-aware mechanism considers the temporal dynamics of stock relationships, ensuring that the model can adapt to changing market conditions. The heterogeneous mechanism, on the other hand, allows the model to handle the diverse nature of the stock market, where different stocks and sectors can have varying degrees of influence on each other. By combining these two mechanisms, the framework can effectively capture both the temporal and structural aspects of stock interactions.

Finally, the deep multi-factor model employs a factor-attention module to identify the deep factors that are most relevant for stock selection. This module not only helps in distinguishing between attractive and unattractive stocks but also provides insights into how these deep factors are derived from the original input factors, such as style and macroeconomic indicators. The effectiveness of this framework is validated through extensive experiments on the S&P 500 and CSI 300 datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in portfolio performance and cumulative returns compared to traditional and state-of-the-art models. The deployment of this model in a real-world trading platform further underscores its practical utility and robustness in dynamic market environments.

## 5.3 Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Management

### 5.3.1 Deep Reinforcement Learning for Financial Portfolio Management
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful tool in financial portfolio management, offering a dynamic and adaptive approach to decision-making in complex and volatile market environments [24]. Unlike traditional rule-based or statistical models, DRL algorithms can learn optimal trading strategies through interaction with the market, continuously adapting to new information and changing conditions. This adaptability is crucial in financial markets, where patterns and relationships can shift rapidly due to various economic, political, and social factors. DRL algorithms, particularly those based on policy gradient methods, have shown significant promise in this domain due to their ability to handle continuous action spaces and optimize long-term rewards.

In the context of financial portfolio management, the state space of DRL models typically includes a wide range of features such as historical prices, trading volumes, market indicators, and macroeconomic data. These features are often processed through multi-layer neural networks, which can capture complex nonlinear relationships and temporal dependencies. For instance, the Multi-Frequency Continuous-Share Quantitative Trading (MCTG) algorithm, which is based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), incorporates multi-frequency data processed by parallel network layers [24]. This approach allows the model to consider both short-term and long-term market dynamics, enhancing its predictive accuracy and decision-making capabilities. The use of multi-frequency data is particularly important in capturing the nuanced movements of financial markets, which can exhibit different behaviors at various time scales.

Furthermore, DRL models in financial portfolio management often employ advanced techniques such as GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) to model and predict market volatility. Volatility is a critical factor in portfolio management, as it directly impacts risk assessment and the allocation of assets. By integrating GARCH models, DRL algorithms can better account for the heteroskedastic nature of financial time series, leading to more robust and reliable trading strategies. Additionally, the use of attention mechanisms and graph neural networks (GNNs) has been explored to model the dynamic relationships between different financial instruments and market entities [5]. These techniques enable the model to focus on the most relevant information and adapt its strategies accordingly, further enhancing its performance in real-world trading scenarios.

### 5.3.2 CNN-based Trading System with Return-weighted Loss Function
In the realm of algorithmic trading, the integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting stock price movements [8]. However, the challenge of effectively leveraging trading information, particularly in high-dimensional and noisy financial datasets, remains a significant bottleneck. To address this issue, we propose a CNN-based trading system augmented with a return-weighted loss function [7]. This novel loss function is designed to prioritize the model's focus on stocks with high growth potential and high risk, thereby enhancing the system's ability to capture top growth opportunities while mitigating potential losses.

The return-weighted loss function is formulated by incorporating a weighted scheme that adjusts the importance of each prediction based on the expected return of the stock. Specifically, the weights are derived from a capped version of the daily percentage return, ensuring that the model pays more attention to stocks with significant price movements. This approach not only helps in identifying high-growth stocks but also in managing the risk associated with volatile assets. By integrating this loss function into the CNN architecture, the model can better learn the complex patterns and temporal dependencies present in multi-frequency stock trading data, leading to improved prediction accuracy and more informed trading decisions.

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed CNN-based trading system with the return-weighted loss function, we conducted extensive experiments using a diverse set of stock market data, including historical trading data at multiple frequencies (5-minute, daily, and weekly intervals) [7]. The results demonstrate that the system outperforms traditional models in terms of cumulative returns and risk-adjusted performance metrics. The enhanced ability to capture and respond to market dynamics, coupled with the strategic weighting of predictions, underscores the potential of this approach in real-world quantitative trading platforms. This work contributes to the growing body of research that leverages deep learning techniques to optimize trading strategies and improve financial market predictions [1].

### 5.3.3 Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Financial Time Series Prediction
Temporal and heterogeneous graph neural networks (TH-GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for financial time series prediction, addressing the complexities inherent in stock market data [5]. By modeling the dynamic relationships between entities such as companies, industries, and market indices, TH-GNNs can capture both temporal and structural dependencies. In this approach, historical stock trading data at multiple frequencies (5-minute, daily, and weekly intervals) are transformed into a temporal and heterogeneous graph, where nodes represent entities and edges encode their relationships. This graph structure allows for the integration of various types of data, including price movements, volume, and macroeconomic indicators, providing a comprehensive representation of the market.

The proposed TH-GNN model employs a two-stage attention mechanism to learn the dynamic relationships within the graph. The first stage focuses on temporal attention, where the model captures the evolving patterns of each entity over time. This is achieved by processing the multi-frequency data through parallel deep neural network (DNN) layers, each tailored to a specific frequency. The outputs from these layers are then combined to form a unified representation that captures the temporal dynamics of the entities. The second stage involves structural attention, which identifies the most relevant relationships between entities in the graph. This dual attention mechanism enables the model to effectively weigh the importance of different temporal and structural features, leading to more accurate predictions.

To further enhance the predictive capabilities of the TH-GNN, the model incorporates a graph learning framework that adapts to the changing market conditions. This framework dynamically updates the graph structure based on the latest market data, ensuring that the model remains relevant and responsive to new information. The combination of temporal and structural attention, along with the dynamic graph learning, allows the TH-GNN to capture the intricate and evolving nature of financial markets [5]. Empirical evaluations on real-world stock market data have demonstrated that this approach outperforms traditional models, highlighting its potential for practical applications in quantitative trading and financial forecasting.
