# 2 Introduction
The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various domains has revolutionized the way we process and understand complex data [1]. LLMs, with their ability to generate human-like text and understand nuanced contexts, have found applications in a wide range of fields, from natural language processing and machine translation to content generation and customer service. However, one of the most promising and impactful areas for LLMs is finance [2]. The financial sector, characterized by its vast amounts of data, complex decision-making processes, and stringent regulatory requirements, stands to benefit significantly from the advanced capabilities of LLMs [2]. This survey paper explores the current state and future directions of LLMs in finance, highlighting their potential to transform various aspects of the industry, from risk management and sentiment analysis to predictive modeling and personal finance advice [2].

This survey paper focuses on the application of LLMs in finance, with a particular emphasis on explainability, privacy, and security. The paper also delves into domain-specific frameworks and agents, as well as the integration of LLMs in time series analysis and reasoning tasks [3]. By examining the latest research and developments in these areas, the paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape and identify key challenges and opportunities for future research. The survey is structured to cover a broad spectrum of topics, ensuring that readers gain a deep understanding of the multifaceted role of LLMs in the financial domain [4].

The paper begins by exploring the critical issues of explainability and privacy in LLMs. Enhancing the reliability and accuracy of LLMs is essential for their adoption in finance, where transparency and trust are paramount. Techniques such as hypergraph-driven retrieval systems (HDRS) are discussed, which leverage hypergraphs to model higher-order relationships among entities, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant retrieval results. The paper also examines optimized jailbreak techniques, which aim to bypass the constraints imposed by LLMs, and the importance of understanding these vulnerabilities to develop more robust security frameworks [1]. Additionally, the paper covers bias detection and mitigation, a crucial component in ensuring that LLMs are fair and transparent, particularly in applications that can have significant societal impacts.

Next, the paper delves into privacy-preserving mechanisms, which are essential for protecting sensitive financial data.

By addressing these challenges and opportunities, the survey aims to foster greater adoption and acceptance of LLMs in finance, ultimately contributing to more efficient, transparent, and secure financial systems [4].

# 3 Explainability and Privacy in LLMs

## 3.1 Enhancing Reliability and Accuracy

### 3.1.1 Hypergraph-Driven Retrieval Systems
Hypergraph-Driven Retrieval Systems (HDRS) represent a significant advancement in the field of information retrieval, particularly in the context of complex, multi-relational data. Unlike traditional graph-based retrieval systems that primarily focus on pairwise relationships, HDRS leverage hypergraphs to model higher-order relationships among entities. This capability is crucial for applications such as recommendation systems, semantic search, and knowledge graph completion, where the relationships between entities are often multifaceted and intricate. By representing these relationships as hyperedges, HDRS can capture and utilize the collective interactions among multiple entities, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant retrieval results.

The core mechanism of HDRS involves the construction of a hypergraph, where nodes represent entities (e.g., users, items, or concepts) and hyperedges represent the relationships among these entities. Each hyperedge can connect more than two nodes, allowing for the representation of complex interactions that cannot be adequately captured by simple graphs. For instance, in a recommendation system, a hyperedge might connect a user, a product, and a context (such as time or location), providing a richer representation of the user's preferences and behavior. This hypergraph structure is then used to perform retrieval tasks, such as finding the most relevant items for a user or identifying the most appropriate context for a recommendation.

To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of HDRS, various techniques have been developed for hypergraph construction, representation learning, and query processing. Hypergraph construction methods often involve the identification of relevant entities and the extraction of their relationships from data sources such as user interactions, content metadata, and external knowledge bases. Representation learning techniques, such as hypergraph neural networks (HGNs), are used to embed the hypergraph into a lower-dimensional space, where the relationships between entities can be more easily analyzed and utilized for retrieval tasks. Query processing in HDRS involves the development of algorithms that can efficiently traverse the hypergraph to find the most relevant entities or paths, often leveraging techniques from graph theory and machine learning to optimize performance and accuracy.

### 3.1.2 Optimized Jailbreak Techniques
Optimized jailbreak techniques represent a significant area of concern in the security landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) [1]. These techniques aim to bypass the constraints imposed by LLMs to generate outputs that violate ethical guidelines, legal standards, or operational policies. One notable approach involves the use of diverse target templates, which allows attackers to craft prompts that are more likely to elicit undesirable responses. By varying the structure and content of these prompts, attackers can explore multiple angles of attack, increasing the likelihood of finding a successful jailbreak.

Another critical aspect of optimized jailbreak techniques is the implementation of an automatic multi-coordinate updating strategy. This strategy involves iteratively refining the attack parameters to maximize the probability of success. Each iteration adjusts the prompt based on the feedback received from the LLM, gradually converging on a configuration that can effectively bypass the model's safeguards. This method leverages the adaptive nature of machine learning to refine the attack, making it more resilient to countermeasures and harder to detect.

Finally, the study of optimized jailbreak techniques also highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms that make LLMs susceptible to such attacks [1]. By examining the vulnerabilities exposed through jailbreaking, researchers can gain valuable insights into the limitations of current LLM architectures and develop more robust security frameworks [1]. This includes enhancing the model's ability to recognize and resist adversarial inputs, as well as implementing more sophisticated monitoring and response systems to detect and mitigate jailbreak attempts in real-time.

### 3.1.3 Bias Detection and Mitigation
Bias detection and mitigation are critical components in the development and deployment of explainable AI (XAI) systems, particularly in ensuring fairness and transparency [5]. The complexity of modern AI models, especially large language models (LLMs) and deep neural networks, often leads to the inadvertent embedding of biases from training data. These biases can manifest in various forms, such as racial, gender, or socioeconomic biases, and can have significant societal impacts, including perpetuating stereotypes and exacerbating inequalities. The detection of bias involves identifying these unfair patterns in model outputs, which can be challenging due to the opaque nature of many AI algorithms.

To address bias, researchers have developed a range of techniques, including statistical methods, adversarial learning, and fairness-aware algorithms. Statistical methods involve analyzing the distribution of model outputs across different demographic groups to identify disparities. Adversarial learning, on the other hand, trains a separate model to detect and counteract biases in the primary model. Fairness-aware algorithms incorporate fairness constraints directly into the model training process, ensuring that the model's predictions are equitable across different groups. These techniques are often used in combination to provide a more robust approach to bias detection and mitigation.

However, the effectiveness of these methods can vary depending on the specific application and the nature of the bias. For instance, in image recognition systems, biases can arise from imbalanced datasets or skewed feature representations, requiring specialized techniques such as data augmentation and rebalancing. In natural language processing (NLP), biases in language use and cultural context can be more subtle and require advanced natural language understanding and context-aware models. Ongoing research is focused on developing more sophisticated and adaptable methods to detect and mitigate bias, ensuring that AI systems are not only accurate but also fair and transparent.

## 3.2 Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms

### 3.2.1 Theoretical and Empirical Analysis
The theoretical and empirical analysis of explainable AI (XAI) is crucial for advancing the field and ensuring that AI systems are transparent, interpretable, and fair [5]. Theoretically, XAI aims to bridge the gap between the complex, often opaque mechanisms of AI models and the human need for understanding and trust [5]. This involves developing mathematical frameworks and algorithms that can decompose the decision-making process of AI models into understandable components. For instance, in the context of large language models (LLMs), theoretical analysis focuses on understanding how these models encode and utilize information from vast datasets, and how this information influences their outputs. This includes exploring the representational capacities of neural networks, the role of attention mechanisms, and the impact of training data biases on model behavior.

Empirically, XAI research involves rigorous testing and validation of these theoretical constructs through experiments and case studies. Empirical analysis often employs a combination of quantitative metrics, such as accuracy and fidelity, and qualitative assessments, such as user studies and expert evaluations, to gauge the effectiveness of XAI techniques. For example, in the healthcare domain, empirical studies might evaluate how well an XAI method helps clinicians understand and trust the recommendations made by an AI system, thereby improving patient outcomes. Similarly, in the financial sector, empirical analysis could focus on how XAI enhances the transparency of risk assessment models, leading to better regulatory compliance and reduced operational risks.

Moreover, the empirical analysis of XAI also addresses the practical challenges and limitations of current methods. This includes assessing the robustness of XAI techniques against adversarial attacks, the scalability of explanations to large and complex models, and the generalizability of XAI methods across different domains and applications. By combining theoretical insights with empirical evidence, researchers can develop more reliable and trustworthy AI systems that align with ethical and legal standards, ultimately fostering greater adoption and acceptance of AI technologies in society [9].

### 3.2.2 Taxonomy of Backdoor Attacks
Backdoor attacks represent a significant threat to the integrity and reliability of large language models (LLMs) [6]. These attacks involve the insertion of hidden functionalities that allow attackers to control the model's behavior under specific conditions. A comprehensive taxonomy of backdoor attacks is essential for understanding and mitigating these threats [6]. The taxonomy can be structured based on the stages of the model's lifecycle: pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference. Each stage presents unique opportunities for adversaries to inject backdoors, and understanding these stages helps in developing targeted defenses.

During the pre-training phase, backdoor attacks often involve data poisoning, where the attacker manipulates the training dataset by injecting carefully crafted samples that contain triggers [10]. These triggers are designed to activate specific behaviors in the model when encountered during inference. The poisoned data can be subtly integrated into the training set, making it difficult to detect. The model learns these triggers alongside legitimate patterns, leading to a compromised model that behaves normally under most conditions but exhibits malicious behavior when triggered.

In the fine-tuning phase, backdoor attacks can be more sophisticated, leveraging the model's existing knowledge to embed triggers more effectively [6]. Attackers may adjust the model's parameters or loss function to ensure that the backdoor is robust and less detectable [10]. Fine-tuning attacks can also involve the use of adversarial examples, where slight perturbations to input data are used to trigger the backdoor. During the inference phase, the focus shifts to ensuring that the backdoor remains active and undetected. Techniques such as dynamic system methods can be employed to monitor and detect anomalous behavior, but they must be carefully designed to avoid false positives and maintain the model's performance. Understanding the nuances of each phase is crucial for developing comprehensive defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks.

### 3.2.3 Metamorphic Testing for Fairness
Metamorphic Testing (MT) is a software testing technique designed to verify the correctness of software systems through the use of metamorphic relations (MRs), which are properties that should hold true before and after a transformation of the input. In the context of fairness in AI, MT can be particularly useful for identifying and mitigating biases that may not be apparent through traditional testing methods. By applying transformations to the input data and observing whether the output maintains certain fairness criteria, MT can help ensure that AI systems behave consistently and fairly across different demographic groups.

In fairness assessment, MRs can be defined to capture various aspects of fairness, such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and predictive parity. For instance, a common MR might involve swapping the gender labels in a dataset and verifying that the model's predictions do not change significantly. If the model's behavior deviates from the expected MR, it indicates a potential bias that needs to be addressed. This approach is especially valuable in scenarios where the ground truth is not readily available or when the data is inherently imbalanced, making it challenging to assess fairness directly.

Moreover, MT can be extended to evaluate the robustness of fairness interventions. By systematically applying transformations that simulate real-world variations in data distribution, researchers can test how well fairness mechanisms perform under different conditions. This not only helps in validating the effectiveness of fairness techniques but also in identifying edge cases where the system may fail to meet fairness standards. Overall, the integration of MT into the fairness evaluation framework provides a rigorous and systematic method for ensuring that AI systems are both fair and reliable [9].

## 3.3 Security and Robustness

### 3.3.1 Backdoor Poisoning Attacks
Backdoor poisoning attacks represent a significant threat to the integrity and reliability of large language models (LLMs) [6]. These attacks involve the strategic insertion of malicious triggers into the training data, which, when activated during inference, cause the model to produce specific, unintended outputs. The attackers typically craft these triggers to be inconspicuous, ensuring that the model's performance remains largely unaffected in normal operations, thereby evading detection. The triggers can be embedded in various forms, such as specific words, phrases, or even subtle patterns in the input data, making them difficult to identify and remove.

The process of backdoor poisoning can occur at different stages of the model's lifecycle, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference [10]. During pre-training, attackers can inject poisoned data into the massive datasets used to train the initial model, ensuring that the backdoor is deeply embedded within the model's architecture [10]. Fine-tuning is another vulnerable stage, where attackers can manipulate smaller, domain-specific datasets to introduce backdoors that activate under specific conditions relevant to the target application. Inference-time attacks are less common but equally dangerous, as they involve dynamically injecting triggers into the input data to elicit the desired malicious behavior. Each stage presents unique challenges and requires distinct defense mechanisms to mitigate the risk of backdoor poisoning.

To effectively combat backdoor poisoning attacks, a multi-faceted approach is necessary. This includes rigorous data validation and cleaning to detect and remove poisoned samples, robust model training techniques that can identify and neutralize backdoors, and continuous monitoring during deployment to detect anomalous behavior. Additionally, researchers are exploring advanced techniques such as adversarial training and anomaly detection to enhance the resilience of LLMs against backdoor attacks [6]. Despite these efforts, the evolving nature of these attacks necessitates ongoing research and collaboration between the academic and industrial communities to stay ahead of emerging threats.

### 3.3.2 Comprehensive Security Architectures
Comprehensive security architectures for large language models (LLMs) are essential to mitigate the multifaceted risks associated with their deployment, particularly in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and government. These architectures integrate multiple layers of security measures to protect against a wide array of threats, including data breaches, model poisoning, and adversarial attacks. One key component of these architectures is the real-time anomaly detection system (ADS), which continuously monitors transaction patterns and user interactions to identify and flag suspicious activities. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the ADS can adapt to evolving threat landscapes and provide timely alerts to security teams, thereby enhancing the overall resilience of the system.

Another critical element is the use of blockchain technology, which provides a decentralized and immutable ledger for recording transactions and data exchanges. This not only ensures the integrity and traceability of data but also reduces the risk of tampering and unauthorized access. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) further strengthens the security framework by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification, thus significantly reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access. Together, these technologies form a robust defense-in-depth strategy that addresses both internal and external threats, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of LLM-driven applications.

To evaluate the effectiveness of these comprehensive security architectures, performance metrics such as reaction time, accuracy in breach detection, and transaction integrity are crucial [11]. Empirical studies have shown that these metrics can provide valuable insights into the system's ability to detect and respond to security incidents promptly and accurately. Additionally, the integration of these security measures must be balanced with the need for system efficiency and user convenience. Future research should focus on optimizing these architectures to minimize performance overhead while maintaining high levels of security, thereby facilitating the widespread adoption of LLMs in various industries.

### 3.3.3 Code-Based Vulnerability Detection
Code-based vulnerability detection is a critical component in the software development lifecycle, aimed at identifying and mitigating security flaws in the source code [12]. This section delves into the methodologies and techniques employed in code-based vulnerability detection, emphasizing their role in enhancing software security [12]. The primary focus is on static and dynamic analysis techniques, which are essential for identifying vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. Static analysis involves examining the code without executing it, using techniques such as data flow analysis, control flow analysis, and pattern matching to detect potential issues. These methods are particularly useful for identifying common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS).

Dynamic analysis, on the other hand, involves running the code in a controlled environment to observe its behavior and identify runtime vulnerabilities. This approach is effective for detecting issues that are not easily discernible through static analysis, such as race conditions and memory leaks. Advanced dynamic analysis tools can simulate various attack scenarios to test the resilience of the software against different types of threats. Both static and dynamic analysis are often complemented by interactive analysis, where developers manually inspect the code to understand the context and intent behind specific code segments, which can help in identifying subtle vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.

Despite the advancements in code-based vulnerability detection, several challenges remain [12]. One of the primary challenges is the high false positive rate, which can lead to unnecessary rework and delays in the development process. Another challenge is the complexity of modern software systems, which often involve multiple layers and dependencies, making it difficult to perform comprehensive analysis. To address these challenges, researchers and practitioners are exploring hybrid approaches that combine static, dynamic, and interactive analysis to provide a more robust and efficient detection mechanism. Additionally, the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence in vulnerability detection tools is gaining traction, as these technologies can help in reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of vulnerability identification.

# 4 Domain-Specific LLMs in Finance

## 4.1 Predictive Models and Risk Management

### 4.1.1 Advanced Machine Learning Integration
Advanced Machine Learning Integration in the financial domain has seen significant advancements, particularly with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models, when fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets, can achieve state-of-the-art performance in various financial NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, summarization, and risk assessment [13]. For instance, the development of Plutus-8B, the first Greek financial LLM, demonstrates the potential of training LLMs on specialized financial data to enhance their performance on domain-specific benchmarks like Plutus-ben [14]. However, the challenge of maintaining up-to-date knowledge in a rapidly evolving financial landscape remains a critical issue. Traditional fine-tuning methods, which rely on periodic updates with new data, are often insufficient to capture the high velocity of financial information. This necessitates the development of more dynamic and adaptive training strategies, such as online learning, to ensure that LLMs can continuously incorporate the latest financial data and trends [4].

To address these challenges, recent research has focused on integrating advanced machine learning techniques that can enhance the adaptability and interpretability of LLMs in financial applications [4]. Sparse AutoEncoders (SAEs), for example, have shown promise in extracting interpretable features from complex financial documents, such as SEC filings. By leveraging the TopK function, SAEs can balance sparsity and reconstruction accuracy, making them suitable for tasks that require both high interpretability and robust performance. Additionally, the application of SAEs in mechanistic interpretability can help financial experts understand the decision-making processes of LLMs, thereby increasing trust and reliability in these models. This is particularly important in the financial sector, where transparency and accountability are paramount.

Another key aspect of advanced machine learning integration in finance is the development of domain-specific post-training frameworks, such as FINDAP [2]. This framework incorporates a set of core capabilities (FinCap) required for financial domain expertise, including domain concepts, tasks, and reasoning [2]. It also includes a training recipe (FinRec) that balances continual pre-training (CPT) and instruction tuning (IT) to mitigate forgetting and improve task generalization. By using a mixture of in-domain and general domain data, FINDAP aims to create specialized LLMs that can effectively handle the unique challenges of the financial domain. These advancements not only enhance the performance of LLMs in financial applications but also pave the way for more sophisticated and reliable AI-driven solutions in the finance industry [4].

### 4.1.2 Cross-Asset Risk Management
Cross-Asset Risk Management (CARM) is a critical component in modern financial systems, particularly in the context of integrating large language models (LLMs) to enhance real-time monitoring and dynamic risk assessment [15]. CARM involves the systematic evaluation and management of risks across various asset classes, including equities, bonds, commodities, and derivatives. The primary goal is to ensure that risks are identified, measured, and managed in a way that aligns with the overall strategic objectives of financial institutions. LLMs play a pivotal role in this process by providing advanced text analysis capabilities, enabling the extraction of valuable insights from unstructured financial data such as news articles, regulatory filings, and market reports [16].

The integration of LLMs in CARM frameworks allows for the synthesis of multiple data sources, including textual, numerical, and temporal data. This synthesis is crucial for understanding the complex interdependencies between different asset classes and for identifying emerging risks that may not be apparent through traditional quantitative methods alone. For instance, LLMs can analyze sentiment in financial news to predict market movements, detect anomalies in financial statements to identify potential fraud, and interpret regulatory changes to assess their impact on various asset classes [15]. By leveraging these capabilities, financial institutions can make more informed decisions, optimize their portfolios, and mitigate potential risks more effectively.

Moreover, the dynamic nature of financial markets requires continuous monitoring and adaptation of risk management strategies. LLMs can facilitate this by providing real-time insights and automated alerts based on predefined risk thresholds. For example, a CARM framework might use LLMs to monitor social media and news feeds for sudden shifts in market sentiment, triggering immediate risk assessments and adjustments to investment strategies. Additionally, LLMs can help in the development of scenario analysis and stress testing, allowing financial institutions to simulate various market conditions and assess the resilience of their portfolios under different risk scenarios. This comprehensive approach to risk management, powered by LLMs, enhances the ability of financial institutions to navigate the complexities of global financial markets and maintain stability in their operations.

### 4.1.3 Personal Finance Response Analysis
Personal finance is a critical aspect of everyday life, yet it remains a challenging domain due to its complexity and the individualized nature of financial needs [8]. Individuals often face difficulties in managing budgets, investments, taxes, and financial planning, leading to suboptimal financial decisions and outcomes. Traditional methods of seeking financial advice, such as consulting financial advisors or using basic online calculators, are often insufficient or inaccessible to many. In response to these challenges, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for providing personalized and accessible financial guidance [1].

In this paper, we systematically evaluate the performance of LLMs in addressing a wide range of personal finance topics, focusing on the U.S [4]. context. We analyze the responses of several prominent LLMs, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Anthropic’s Claude, to questions related to mortgages, taxes, loans, and investments [8]. Our evaluation framework includes metrics such as accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction. The results indicate that while LLMs can provide useful and often accurate information, they still exhibit limitations, particularly in handling complex financial scenarios and maintaining consistency across different topics [4]. For instance, some models perform well in tax-related inquiries but struggle with investment advice, highlighting the need for domain-specific fine-tuning and continuous improvement.

To enhance the reliability and utility of LLMs in personal finance, we explore the impact of fine-tuning with human feedback, as exemplified by InstructGPT. Our findings suggest that incorporating human feedback during the training process significantly improves the alignment of LLM outputs with user intent, reducing the likelihood of misleading or harmful advice. This approach is particularly crucial in risk management, where accurate and trustworthy information is paramount. Additionally, we discuss the potential of integrating advanced analytics and real-time data to further refine LLM responses, enabling them to provide more nuanced and contextually relevant financial guidance. As LLM technology continues to advance, the prospects for transforming personal finance management through AI are increasingly promising [8].

## 4.2 Sentiment Analysis and Data Generation

### 4.2.1 Financial Text Sentiment Analysis
Financial text sentiment analysis (FTSA) is a critical component in the domain of financial natural language processing (NLP), aimed at extracting and quantifying the emotional tone from financial texts such as news articles, social media posts, and analyst reports. Unlike general sentiment analysis, FTSA requires a deep understanding of financial terminology, market dynamics, and the nuanced language used by financial professionals. Early approaches to FTSA primarily relied on lexicon-based methods, where pre-defined lists of positive and negative words were used to score the sentiment of financial texts. However, these methods often failed to capture the context and complexity of financial language, leading to inaccuracies in sentiment classification.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of FTSA [1]. Models like BERT, FinBERT, and GPT have been fine-tuned on financial datasets, enabling them to better understand the context and nuances of financial text [17]. These models leverage deep learning architectures to capture the semantic and syntactic structures of text, allowing for more accurate sentiment analysis. For instance, BERT-type models use bidirectional transformers to encode the context of words, while GPT-type models employ autoregressive architectures to generate coherent and contextually relevant predictions. The integration of these models with financial datasets has led to improved performance in identifying subtle sentiments and market reactions, making them valuable tools for financial analysts and traders.

Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in FTSA. The financial domain is characterized by rapid changes and high volatility, which can lead to sudden shifts in sentiment. LLMs must be continuously updated and fine-tuned to adapt to these changes, ensuring that they remain effective in real-world applications [18]. Additionally, the interpretability of LLMs in financial contexts remains a concern, as stakeholders often require transparent and explainable models. Future research in FTSA should focus on developing more interpretable models and exploring the integration of domain-specific knowledge to enhance the accuracy and reliability of sentiment analysis in financial texts [17].

### 4.2.2 FinNLI Dataset Generation
The generation of the FinNLI dataset is a critical component of our work, designed to address the specific challenges of natural language inference (NLI) in the financial domain [13]. Unlike general NLI datasets, which often contain biases and artifacts, FinNLI is meticulously crafted to ensure high-quality, domain-specific annotations. The dataset generation process begins with the selection of premises from a diverse array of financial documents, including news articles, SEC filings, and financial reports. These documents are chosen to cover a wide range of financial genres and contexts, ensuring that the dataset reflects the complexity and variability of real-world financial data.

To generate hypothesis-label pairs, we employ multiple large language models (LLMs) to propose hypotheses based on the selected premises. This multi-model approach helps to introduce diversity and reduce the risk of bias that can arise from a single model's predictions. The generated hypotheses are then subjected to a rigorous filtering process using Z-filtering, a technique that identifies and removes spurious correlations and artifacts. This step is crucial for ensuring that the dataset is robust and that models trained on it can generalize well to unseen data.

Finally, the dataset undergoes a refinement phase where the prompts and hypotheses are further curated based on feedback from both a general-domain NLI model and domain experts. This iterative process ensures that the dataset not only meets the technical standards of NLI tasks but also aligns with the specific requirements and nuances of the financial domain. The resulting FinNLI dataset is a high-quality resource that can be used to evaluate and improve the performance of LLMs on financial NLI tasks, thereby advancing the state of the art in financial language processing [13].

### 4.2.3 Chronologically Consistent LLMs
Chronologically consistent LLMs are designed to avoid lookahead bias by training exclusively on historical data available up to a specific point in time. This approach ensures that the models do not have access to future information, which is crucial for applications in domains like finance where historical accuracy and temporal consistency are paramount. Despite the conceptual simplicity of this method, ensuring that these models remain competitive with state-of-the-art counterparts presents significant challenges. The primary issue is maintaining the model's performance while adhering to strict chronological constraints, as the model must learn to generalize effectively from a limited and potentially outdated dataset.

To address these challenges, we propose a framework that involves training a series of LLMs with knowledge cutoffs spanning from 1999 to 2024. Each model is trained on data available up to its respective cutoff year, ensuring that it does not have access to future information. This approach not only helps in maintaining chronological consistency but also allows for a comparative analysis of how the model's performance evolves over time. By training models on progressively more recent data, we can evaluate the impact of temporal data on model performance and identify potential areas for improvement. For instance, models trained on more recent data may exhibit better performance in tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, such as financial forecasting and market analysis.

Our framework also explores the use of domain-specific fine-tuning to enhance the performance of chronologically consistent LLMs [19]. Fine-tuning on financial data from the relevant time period can help the models better understand the nuances of financial language and improve their ability to handle domain-specific tasks. This approach is particularly useful in addressing the limitations of general-purpose LLMs, which may struggle with the specialized terminology and context found in financial texts [4]. By combining chronological consistency with domain-specific fine-tuning, we aim to develop LLMs that are both historically accurate and capable of high-level language comprehension, thereby opening new avenues for credible LLM applications in the social sciences [20].

## 4.3 Domain-Specific Frameworks and Agents

### 4.3.1 Finance-Specific Frameworks
Finance-specific frameworks represent a critical advancement in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the financial domain, addressing the unique challenges posed by financial data [16]. These frameworks are designed to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in handling specialized financial tasks, such as sentiment analysis, risk assessment, and financial reporting [4]. One notable framework is FINDAP, which integrates four key components: FinCap, FinRec, FinTrain, and FinEval [2]. FinCap focuses on defining the core capabilities required for a financial domain expert, including financial concepts, reasoning, and task execution. FinRec encompasses data and model strategies to guide domain-adaptive post-training, ensuring that the model can effectively learn from and adapt to financial data [2]. FinTrain curates training texts and prompts based on a carefully designed data recipe, while FinEval provides a systematic approach to evaluating the performance of the trained model on financial tasks.

Another important framework is the Cross-Asset Risk Management (CARM) framework, which leverages LLMs for real-time monitoring and dynamic risk assessment across different financial markets [15]. CARM synthesizes multiple data sources, including financial texts, news articles, and market reports, to provide a comprehensive view of potential risks and opportunities. By integrating advanced analytics and natural language processing, CARM enhances the ability of financial institutions to make informed decisions and manage risks more effectively. The framework has been validated through extensive backtesting and real-time simulations, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and reliability compared to traditional risk management approaches.

Finally, the development of Plutus-8B represents a significant milestone in the creation of Greek financial LLMs. Fine-tuned on Greek domain-specific data, Plutus-8B bridges the gap between existing models and Greek financial tasks, addressing the limitations of English-trained models in handling the nuances of Greek financial discourse [14]. This model demonstrates the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning in improving the performance of LLMs on specialized tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER) and numerical reasoning. The success of Plutus-8B highlights the potential for developing similar models for other underrepresented languages and financial markets, thereby expanding the applicability of LLMs in global finance [14].

### 4.3.2 Financial Agent Development
The development of financial agents, particularly those leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), has seen significant advancements aimed at addressing the unique challenges of the financial domain [16]. These challenges include the need for specialized financial terminology, numerical reasoning, and the ability to handle ambiguous contexts. Traditional models, such as LLaMA-3.2-1B, Qwen2.5-1.5B, and Mistral-7B, often fail to meet these requirements, particularly in tasks like named entity recognition (NER) and question answering (QA). The introduction of domain-specific models, like Plutus-8B, which is the first Greek financial LLM, marks a crucial step forward [14]. Plutus-8B, along with the Plutus-ben benchmark and Plutus-instruction dataset, provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and fine-tuning financial LLMs in the Greek language, addressing the gap in multilingual financial NLP [14].

The development of financial agents involves not only the creation of specialized models but also the integration of these models into practical applications. For instance, the fine-tuning of FinBloom 7B on the Financial Context Dataset to create a Financial Agent demonstrates the potential for these models to generate contextually relevant answers and extract data from financial modules [21]. This agent is capable of handling dynamic financial scenarios, ensuring precise and contextually accurate responses [21]. The effectiveness of such agents is validated through rigorous testing and comparison with other popular models, highlighting the importance of domain-specific post-training frameworks like FINDAP. FINDAP integrates core capabilities (FinCap), data and model strategies (FinRec), and training text curation (FinTrain) to guide the development of financial LLMs [2].

The integration of LLMs into financial applications is further supported by methodological advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and the growing body of literature on financial sentiment analysis [17]. These advancements have evolved from early dictionary-based approaches to more sophisticated techniques like topic modeling and the integration of LLMs. The ability of LLMs to understand financial sentiment, perform next-sentence prediction, and analyze structured financial data is crucial for applications such as risk assessment, stock market prediction, and automated financial reporting [4]. As the field continues to evolve, the development of financial agents will likely focus on enhancing interpretability, robustness, and the integration of real-time data, ultimately leading to more credible and effective AI-driven financial solutions [8].

### 4.3.3 Greek Financial Evaluation Benchmark
The Greek Financial Evaluation Benchmark, known as Plutus-ben, represents a significant milestone in the development of domain-specific benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in the financial sector [14]. Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily focus on English or other major languages, Plutus-ben is tailored specifically for the Greek financial market, addressing a critical gap in the current landscape. This benchmark encompasses five essential financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, relation extraction, question answering, and text classification, each designed to reflect the unique challenges and requirements of the Greek financial ecosystem [14].

Plutus-ben is complemented by Plutus-instruction, a novel dataset curated for fine-tuning LLMs on Greek financial instructions. This dataset not only enhances the model's ability to understand and execute complex financial tasks but also ensures that the models are better aligned with the linguistic and cultural nuances of the Greek market. The creation of Plutus-instruction involved meticulous annotation and validation processes to ensure high-quality data, which is crucial for training robust and reliable financial LLMs. By integrating these tasks and instructions, Plutus-ben provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the performance of LLMs in a variety of financial applications, from automated report generation to real-time market analysis.

To further advance the capabilities of LLMs in the Greek financial domain, we have developed Plutus8B, the first Greek financial LLM fine-tuned on domain-specific data [14]. Plutus8B leverages the rich and diverse data sources available in the Greek financial market, including regulatory filings, news articles, and financial reports, to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Plutus-ben benchmark. This model demonstrates the potential of fine-tuning large pre-trained models on specialized datasets to enhance their performance in niche areas, paving the way for more tailored and effective solutions in the financial technology sector. The success of Plutus8B underscores the importance of domain-specific benchmarks and datasets in driving innovation and practical applications of LLMs in finance.

# 5 Time Series Analysis with LLMs

## 5.1 Anomaly Detection and Debiasing

### 5.1.1 k-NN Detector Refinement
In the context of time series anomaly detection, the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm is a popular choice due to its simplicity and effectiveness in identifying anomalies based on distance metrics. However, traditional k-NN detectors often suffer from high false alarm rates and limited contextual understanding, which can degrade their performance in complex and noisy environments. To address these limitations, we propose a method that leverages large language models (LLMs) to refine the outputs of k-NN detectors. This approach involves post-processing the k-NN results using LLMs to filter out false positives and provide more accurate and contextually relevant anomaly detections.

The refinement process begins by identifying potential anomalies using a standard k-NN detector. The k-NN algorithm classifies a data point as an anomaly if its distance to its k-nearest neighbors exceeds a predefined threshold. However, this thresholding approach can be overly simplistic and may lead to false alarms, especially in datasets with varying noise levels and complex patterns. To mitigate this, the identified anomalies are passed to an LLM, which evaluates each potential anomaly in the context of the surrounding data. The LLM can leverage its natural language processing capabilities to interpret the temporal and contextual information, thereby providing a more nuanced assessment of whether a data point is truly anomalous.

Through this hybrid approach, the LLM can significantly enhance the precision of the k-NN detector by reducing false positives and providing explanatory insights into its decisions. The LLM's ability to incorporate domain-specific knowledge and contextual information allows it to make more informed judgments, leading to improved overall performance [2]. Experimental results on a variety of time series datasets from the Hexagon ML/UCR archive demonstrate that this LLM-refined k-NN detector outperforms traditional k-NN methods in terms of both precision and recall, highlighting the potential of integrating LLMs into time series anomaly detection workflows [22].

### 5.1.2 Self-Debiasing Prompting Strategy
Self-debiasing prompting is a novel approach designed to systematically identify and mitigate cognitive biases within prompts used in large language models (LLMs) [23]. This strategy involves a three-step iterative process: bias determination, bias analysis, and cognitive debiasing. Initially, the bias determination step involves breaking down the prompt to detect the presence of cognitive biases. If a bias is identified, the next step is a thorough analysis to understand the nature and extent of the bias. This analysis is crucial for tailoring the subsequent debiasing step, where the prompt is modified to eliminate or reduce the identified bias. The process is repeated until the prompt is free from significant cognitive biases, ensuring that the LLM's output is more reliable and unbiased.

Compared to existing cognitive debiasing methods, such as the self-help approach proposed by Echterhoff et al., the self-debiasing prompting strategy offers several advantages [23]. The self-help method, while effective in addressing a single type of cognitive bias, fails in more complex scenarios where multiple biases coexist or where no bias is present. In the no-bias setting, the self-help method may inadvertently introduce noise by modifying bias-free prompts, leading to a degradation in performance. Similarly, in the multi-bias setting, the self-help method's lack of a systematic analysis can result in suboptimal debiasing, as it modifies prompts without a clear understanding of the underlying biases. These limitations highlight the need for a more robust and adaptive debiasing strategy.

The self-debiasing prompting strategy addresses these limitations by providing a structured and iterative approach to cognitive debiasing [23]. By systematically identifying and analyzing biases, this method ensures that only necessary modifications are made to the prompts, preserving their original intent while enhancing the reliability of the LLM's output. This approach not only improves the precision of the LLM's responses but also enhances the interpretability of the results, making it particularly useful in applications where decision-making accuracy is critical. The iterative nature of the self-debiasing process also allows for continuous improvement, adapting to new types of biases as they emerge, thus maintaining the effectiveness of the LLM over time.

### 5.1.3 ESG Activity Identification
ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) activity identification is a critical component in the assessment of corporate sustainability and responsible investment [24]. This task involves the accurate recognition and classification of activities that align with ESG criteria, which can range from environmental conservation efforts to ethical labor practices. Traditional methods for ESG activity identification often rely on manual review and expert judgment, which can be time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into this process offers a promising solution by leveraging their ability to understand and interpret unstructured textual data [4]. LLMs can parse through extensive documentation, such as annual reports, sustainability disclosures, and news articles, to identify and categorize ESG activities with high precision and recall.

One of the primary challenges in ESG activity identification is the variability and complexity of the language used to describe these activities. Unlike structured data, textual descriptions can vary significantly in terminology, detail, and context. LLMs excel in this domain by applying advanced natural language processing techniques to extract meaningful insights from diverse and unstructured sources. For example, an LLM can recognize synonyms and related terms, understand the context in which activities are described, and even infer implicit information that might not be explicitly stated. This capability is crucial for accurately identifying activities that contribute to sustainability goals, such as reducing carbon emissions, promoting diversity and inclusion, or ensuring transparent governance practices.

To enhance the effectiveness of ESG activity identification, LLMs can be fine-tuned on domain-specific datasets that include labeled examples of ESG activities. This fine-tuning process allows the model to learn the nuances and specificities of ESG-related language, improving its performance in real-world applications. Additionally, integrating LLMs with other data sources, such as time series data and knowledge graphs, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the context in which ESG activities occur. For instance, combining LLM-generated insights with time series data on environmental metrics can help track the progress and impact of sustainability initiatives over time. This multi-modal approach not only enhances the accuracy of ESG activity identification but also supports more informed decision-making in corporate sustainability and responsible investment.

## 5.2 Multi-Task and Multi-Modal Analysis

### 5.2.1 Time-MQA Framework
The Time-MQA (Time Series Multi-Query Answering) framework is designed to enhance the reasoning and inference capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the context of time series data [25]. This framework leverages the advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities of LLMs to interpret and analyze time series data through natural language queries, thereby enabling deeper insights and more sophisticated reasoning beyond traditional numeric tasks. The Time-MQA framework addresses a critical gap in the current landscape of time series analysis, where the integration of LLMs with time series data is often limited by the lack of appropriate datasets and benchmarks.

To facilitate the development and evaluation of models within the Time-MQA framework, a large-scale dataset, TSQA, has been created. This dataset consists of paired language and time series data, spanning multiple domains and tasks, and includes open-ended reasoning questions with detailed text-based explanations [25]. The TSQA dataset is designed to bridge the gap between classical time series analysis and modern LLM-driven approaches by providing a rich source of training and evaluation data. The dataset's diversity and complexity enable models to learn and generalize across a wide range of time series tasks, from anomaly detection to forecasting and event prediction.

Experiments conducted using the TSQA dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the Time-MQA framework in enhancing the time series reasoning capabilities of LLMs [25]. Representative models, such as Mistral 7B, Llama-3 8B, and Qwen-2.5 7B, were fine-tuned on the TSQA dataset and showed significant improvements in their ability to generate task-specific assertions and explanations. These models outperformed the closed-source GPT-4 in identifying desirable assertions by an average of 20.93%, highlighting the potential of the Time-MQA framework to advance the state of the art in time series analysis and reasoning. The open-source nature of the TSQA dataset and the associated benchmark further facilitate reproducibility and future research in this domain.

### 5.2.2 VersaTune Data Composition
VersaTune's data composition strategy is designed to enhance the versatility and performance of large language models (LLMs) across various domains during supervised fine-tuning [19]. The framework begins by detecting the proportion distribution of domain knowledge within the target model, ensuring that the fine-tuning process is aligned with the existing knowledge base [26]. This initial step is crucial for maintaining the model's capabilities in non-target domains, thus preventing catastrophic forgetting. By carefully balancing the domain knowledge proportions, VersaTune ensures that the model remains robust and adaptable, even when fine-tuned on specialized datasets [19].

The data composition strategy employed by VersaTune is both efficient and flexible. It leverages distribution consistency training during the fine-tuning stage, which helps maintain the model's performance across different tasks and domains. This approach is particularly beneficial for open-source models with varying parameter sizes, ranging from 7B to 14B. The flexibility of VersaTune allows it to be adapted to specific scenarios, such as expanding performance on particular domain tasks while minimizing the degradation of the model's capabilities in other areas. This balance is achieved through a dynamic data composition process that adjusts the proportion of domain-specific data based on the model's current knowledge distribution.

To validate the effectiveness of VersaTune, extensive experiments were conducted using a variety of LLMs, including Mistral 7B, Llama-3 8B, and Qwen-2.5 7B. These models were fine-tuned on the TSQA dataset, which combines time series data with textual descriptions, to assess their ability to reason about temporal data through natural language queries [25]. The results demonstrated significant improvements in the models' performance, particularly in tasks requiring advanced reasoning and inference. The efficient and flexible nature of VersaTune's data composition strategy makes it a valuable tool for enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in diverse and complex environments.

### 5.2.3 Climate Forecasting with LLMs
In the realm of climate forecasting, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool, capable of generating detailed and contextually rich predictions. Unlike traditional numerical models that rely solely on historical data and physical equations, LLMs can integrate textual information, such as meteorological reports, news articles, and scientific papers, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of climate patterns. This integration of textual and numerical data allows LLMs to capture complex interactions and dependencies that might not be evident in purely numerical models. For instance, LLMs can infer the impact of human activities, policy changes, and natural phenomena on climate trends, enhancing the predictive accuracy and interpretability of climate forecasts.

However, the application of LLMs in climate forecasting is not without challenges. One of the primary issues is the computational cost associated with running these models, especially for high-frequency or long-term predictions. The resource-intensive nature of LLMs can limit their applicability in real-time or resource-constrained settings. Additionally, LLMs often struggle with arithmetic operations and may lack the transparency needed for reliable Bayesian inference, which is crucial for understanding the uncertainty in climate predictions. Despite these limitations, recent studies have shown that LLMs can be effectively fine-tuned on climate-specific datasets to improve their performance in generating accurate short-term and long-term climate forecasts [27]. For example, experiments with models like ChatGPT-4 have demonstrated the potential of LLMs to capture and predict climate trends, particularly in rainfall forecasting [27].

To advance the use of LLMs in climate forecasting, future research should focus on developing more efficient and transparent models that can handle the computational demands of real-time predictions while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, the creation of large-scale, multimodal datasets that combine time series data with textual information is essential for training LLMs to better understand and predict climate patterns. Furthermore, benchmarking and evaluation frameworks specific to climate forecasting tasks are needed to systematically assess the performance of LLMs and identify areas for improvement [27]. By addressing these challenges, LLMs can become a valuable tool in the arsenal of climate scientists and policymakers, providing actionable insights for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.

## 5.3 Reasoning and Prediction

### 5.3.1 Multimodal Time Series Analysis
Multimodal time series analysis involves the integration of multiple data types, such as numerical time series data and natural language text, to enhance the understanding and prediction of complex systems [3]. This approach leverages the complementary strengths of different data modalities to provide a more comprehensive and accurate analysis. For instance, in financial markets, time series data of stock prices can be augmented with textual data from news articles and social media to better predict market trends and anomalies. The integration of these modalities requires sophisticated models that can effectively process and correlate diverse data sources.

One of the key challenges in multimodal time series analysis is the development of models that can seamlessly integrate and reason over different types of data [3]. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for addressing this challenge [1]. LLMs, with their ability to understand and generate natural language, can be used to enhance the interpretability and context-awareness of time series models [7]. For example, LLMs can provide descriptive insights and explanations for observed patterns in time series data, which can be particularly useful in domains like healthcare and finance where interpretability is crucial. Moreover, LLMs can be fine-tuned to incorporate domain-specific knowledge, further improving their performance in specialized tasks [2].

To effectively leverage LLMs in multimodal time series analysis, several technical considerations must be addressed [18]. First, the design of multimodal architectures that can efficiently combine the outputs of time series models and LLMs is essential [3]. This often involves the development of hybrid models that integrate temporal convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, and transformer-based LLMs. Second, the preservation of LLM capabilities during the integration process is crucial to ensure that the natural language understanding and reasoning abilities of LLMs are not compromised. Finally, the evaluation of multimodal models requires the use of comprehensive benchmarks that can assess the models' performance across various tasks, including forecasting, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition. These benchmarks should also consider the interpretability and robustness of the models, which are critical for real-world applications.

### 5.3.2 AutoElicit Algorithm for Priors
The AutoElicit algorithm represents a significant advancement in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for prior elicitation in linear models, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of predictive tasks [28]. Unlike traditional methods that rely on uninformative priors or require extensive domain expertise, AutoElicit automates the process of generating informative priors by utilizing the natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The algorithm operates by formulating a series of structured queries to the LLM, which are designed to elicit expert knowledge about the parameters of interest. These queries are carefully crafted to cover a range of possible scenarios and contexts, ensuring that the LLM's responses are comprehensive and contextually relevant.

Once the LLM generates its responses, the AutoElicit algorithm processes these outputs to construct a prior distribution over the model parameters. This distribution is then integrated into the Bayesian framework, where it serves as a starting point for posterior inference. The use of LLM-elicited priors has been shown to significantly improve the performance of linear models, particularly in scenarios with limited data [28]. By providing a more informed starting point, AutoElicit reduces the number of required training examples and accelerates the convergence of the model to optimal solutions. This is particularly beneficial in time-sensitive applications, such as predicting urinary tract infections (UTIs) in dementia care, where early and accurate predictions can lead to timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.

Moreover, the AutoElicit algorithm is adaptable to various types of predictive tasks, including those involving time series data. In benchmark studies, AutoElicit has consistently outperformed uninformative priors and even some forms of in-context learning (ICL) in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. The algorithm's flexibility allows it to be applied across different domains, from financial forecasting to traffic management, making it a versatile tool for enhancing the performance of linear models in a wide range of applications. By integrating the rich semantic and contextual understanding of LLMs, AutoElicit bridges the gap between traditional statistical methods and modern machine learning techniques, offering a powerful approach to prior elicitation [28].

### 5.3.3 Event Description Inference
Event Description Inference (EDI) is a critical task in time series analysis, where the objective is to infer the occurrence of specific events from the temporal data. Traditional approaches often rely on domain-specific knowledge and task-specific models, which can limit their generality and efficiency [26]. Recent advancements, such as the integration of large language models (LLMs) into time series tasks, have shown promise in enhancing the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of these models [3]. However, most existing methods focus on feature alignment between time series data and language models, often neglecting the importance of semantic task descriptions and event inference [26].

To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark that integrates time series data with associated natural language event descriptions [7]. This benchmark is designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to infer events from time series data, providing a more comprehensive assessment of their reasoning capabilities [7]. The dataset includes a diverse range of time series from various domains, such as sports, finance, and climate science, each paired with detailed event descriptions. By leveraging this benchmark, we can systematically assess how well LLMs can infer events based on temporal patterns and contextual information [7].

Our approach involves developing a Knowledge-Driven Temporal Prompt (KDTP) module, which generates high-quality temporal prompts by incorporating knowledge graphs [26]. This module enhances the semantic understanding of the LLMs, enabling them to better infer events from the time series data. The KDTP module is designed to be plug-and-play, allowing seamless integration into other multi-modal time series frameworks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the KDTP module significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of event inference, highlighting the potential of combining knowledge graphs with LLMs in time series analysis.
