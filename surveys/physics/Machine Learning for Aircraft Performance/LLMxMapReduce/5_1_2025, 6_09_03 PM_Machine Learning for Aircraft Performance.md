# 0. Machine Learning for Aircraft Performance  

# 1. Introduction  

The aerospace industry is undergoing a significant transformation, propelled by advancements in computational power and the proliferation of available data. These developments have rendered artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques increasingly viable and impactful within aerospace engineering [1,10,13,19,23,26,29].​  

Traditionally, aircraft performance analysis and optimization have heavily relied on computationally intensive methods such as numerical integration, finite element analysis, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [8,10,13]. While foundational, these approaches often present significant limitations. CFD simulations, particularly for complex threedimensional geometries like wings or for predicting phenomena such as aerodynamic heating, are time-consuming and demand substantial computational resources [6,8]. Furthermore, traditional design optimization processes often involve resource-intensive iterative refinements through extensive numerical simulations [14]. In areas like aero engine control, traditional methods based on linear models designed for specific flight states prove inadequate for engines operating across a wide flight envelope or experiencing performance degradation due to aging components [9]. Similarly, conventional approaches to predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of components may overlook complex dependencies between sensor data and fail to account for inherent uncertainties [4]. These limitations, including high computational costs, lengthy turnaround times, and potential inaccuracies under varying or degraded conditions, strongly motivate the exploration of alternative, more efficient, and adaptive methodologies.

In contrast, machine learning offers a powerful data-driven paradigm capable of addressing these challenges [13,29]. ML methods, particularly emerging data-driven optimization techniques, are well-suited for high-dimensional, nonconvex, constrained, and multi-objective problems prevalent in aircraft design and manufacturing, with performance improving as data volumes increase [19]. The potential of ML to revolutionize traditional methods in aircraft design and performance optimization is significant, offering advantages such as improved efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced safety [2,5,21,22].  

The increasing relevance of machine learning in aircraft performance is underscored by diverse research objectives across the field. Studies aim to leverage ML for predictive maintenance to minimize downtime and reduce costs [2,5], predict component failures, and integrate prognostics into dynamic maintenance scheduling frameworks [4,12]. In aerodynamics, the focus is on using ML to accelerate simulations, predict flow fields and aerodynamic coefficients, and develop generative models for direct airfoil design, reducing reliance on traditional CFD and wind tunnel testing [6,8,10,14,20]. For flight control and autonomous systems, researchers are exploring deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to create intelligent, adaptive controllers capable of operating across wide flight envelopes and compensating for degradation [7,9,23,26]. Furthermore, ML is being applied to enhance aviation safety through predictive analytics and improved air traffic management [21] and to reduce the environmental impact of aviation by optimizing routes and forecasts [25]. This collective effort highlights the potential of ML to address critical challenges and drive innovation across various facets of aircraft performance.

Key challenges in aircraft performance that ML is poised to address include optimizing fuel consumption, enhancing safety, reducing maintenance costs, accelerating complex design processes, and enabling autonomous and adaptive control under dynamic conditions [2,4,5,8,9,14,21,25].  

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art applications of machine learning in aircraft performance. Specifically, it will cover detailed applications in areas such as predictive maintenance and health monitoring, aerodynamic design and analysis, flight control and guidance, and operational optimization and safety [2,4,5,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,20,21,23,25]. While significant progress has been made, research gaps persist, particularly concerning the integration of prognostic information into maintenance planning [12], ensuring model interpretability and certifiability for safety-critical applications [19,20], and robustly handling uncertainty [4,25]. By synthesizing current research and identifying key challenges and opportunities, this survey aims to establish the necessity of continued research in this evolving field and provide a structured guide for researchers and practitioners interested in leveraging machine learning to enhance aircraft performance.  

# 2. Fundamentals of Aircraft Performance  

Aircraft performance analysis involves the study of how an aircraft behaves under various conditions, assessing its capabilities and limitations throughout its flight envelope. Fundamental principles dictate the interplay of forces such as lift, drag, weight, and thrust, which are intrinsically linked to aircraft geometry, operating parameters, and atmospheric conditions [22,24].

Key performance parameters encompass a wide range of metrics crucial for design, operation, and maintenance. These include aerodynamic characteristics such as lift coefficient $( C _ { l } )$ , drag coefficient $( C _ { D } )$ , and pressure distribution around airfoils and the overall aircraft structure [8,14,20]. Beyond basic aerodynamics, critical parameters extend to stall speed, fuel consumption, range, endurance, and aerodynamic heating, particularly for high-speed flight regimes [6,15,34]. Operational performance aspects like flight time, weather forecast accuracy influencing route efficiency, maneuverability, robustness, safety, and the ability to handle external disturbances and uncertainties are also vital considerations [23,25]. Furthermore, the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of critical components like aero engines is a key performance indicator for ensuring safety and optimizing maintenance [4,5,12]. Comprehensive aircraft design and analysis software suites integrate modules covering weight estimation, aerodynamics, propulsion, stability, control, dynamics, loads, structures, and cost analysis, all reliant on the accurate determination and interplay of these parameters [24].​  

Traditionally, aircraft performance analysis, prediction, and control have relied heavily on physics-based methods, empirical models, and experimental techniques [15,24,34]. For aerodynamic performance prediction, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations have become a widespread tool, driven by advancements in high-performance computing [8,13]. These methods solve governing fluid dynamics equations to predict parameters like lift, drag, and pressure distribution [8]. Similarly, aerodynamic heating predictions, particularly for hypersonic vehicles, traditionally employ CFD simulations, often used to generate data for subsequent analyses [6]. Aerodynamic optimization, aiming to improve metrics like buffet lift coefficient and cruise drag coefficient for airfoil design, has historically involved extensive numerical simulations, iterative processes, numerical integration, and finite element analysis [10,14]. Experimental methods like wind tunnel testing also play a crucial role in validating simulations and empirical models, though their physical limitations in replicating all flight conditions are acknowledged.  

In the domain of aircraft control, traditional methods range from basic PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers, foundational to automatic control, to more advanced techniques such as Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR), Model Predictive Control (MPC), adaptive control, dynamic inversion, backstepping control, and sliding mode control [7,9,26]. For engine control, PID, LQR, MPC, and adaptive control are common [9]. Flight control often utilizes linear gain scheduling or modern model-based techniques [7]. Navigation and disturbance rejection systems have historically used models like quasisteady aerodynamic models [23].​  

For the critical task of aero engine RUL prediction, traditional approaches fall into model-based and data-driven categories [4]. Model-based methods rely on physical degradation models, while traditional data-driven methods analyze historical sensor data [4]. Maintenance scheduling itself has traditionally followed fixed intervals or reactive strategies [12], sometimes based on engineers' interpretation of data [5]. Flight planning and weather forecasting have also relied on established meteorological models and planning algorithms [25].  

Despite their foundational importance, these traditional methods face inherent limitations that motivate the exploration and adoption of machine learning techniques. CFD simulations and extensive numerical processes, while powerful, demand significant computational resources and time, hindering rapid design iteration and optimization, especially for complex geometries and flow conditions [6,8,10,13,14,20]. Aerodynamic optimization methods like numerical integration can also be susceptible to converging only to local optima [10]. Physical testing methods, such as wind tunnels, while providing valuable data, are constrained by scaling effects and the inability to perfectly replicate all real-world flight environments and conditions.​  

Traditional control methods struggle with the complex, nonlinear, time-varying, and uncertain nature inherent in aircraft systems like aero engines or flight dynamics [9]. Methods depending on precise mathematical models, such as LQR and MPC, suffer when these models are inaccurate or incomplete, a common issue in complex systems [7,9]. While PID is modelindependent, its performance is limited in such complex scenarios [9]. Model-based control requires accurate modeling, and errors can impact performance or lead to critical failures [7]. Linear gain scheduling involves tedious parameter tuning over multiple operating points [7]. Quasi-steady aerodynamic models used in control are limited in capturing highly nonlinear and unsteady behaviors, particularly during aggressive maneuvers [23].​  

For RUL prediction, model-based methods are challenged by the difficulty in fully understanding complex degradation mechanisms [4]. Traditional data-driven RUL approaches may overlook non-Euclidean spatial relationships within sensor data and neglect crucial uncertainties in the data or prediction process [4]. Traditional fixed-interval or reactive maintenance strategies often result in suboptimal outcomes, either causing premature maintenance or risking delayed actions, as they fail to adapt to the actual condition of the equipment [5,12]. Furthermore, traditional methods for weather forecasting and flight planning can lack the precision and adaptability needed to handle dynamic, complex, and uncertain environmental conditions efficiently [25]. These limitations in computational efficiency, model accuracy, adaptability, and the ability to handle complex, nonlinear dynamics and large volumes of sensor data form the primary motivation for exploring machine learning techniques in aircraft performance analysis, prediction, and control.​  

# 3. Machine Learning for Aerodynamic Design and Prediction  

![](images/c8cb6f094f569b7e9d6723c37339818d5a778c1aec58dec440e2f6a5eace80bf.jpg)  

Machine learning (ML) is fundamentally transforming aerodynamic design and prediction, which have historically relied heavily on computationally intensive traditional methods such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and expensive experimental testing [10]. This paradigm shift leverages the power of ML algorithms to enhance various stages of the design process, leading to significant improvements in efficiency, creativity, and performance. ML techniques are being applied to generate novel aerodynamic designs, accurately predict complex aerodynamic characteristics like lift coefficients and full flow fields [8,20], and optimize existing designs for improved performance or reduced cost [10].

The application of ML spans diverse aerodynamic components and tasks. In airfoil design, ML models, including Transformer and Vision Transformer (ViT)–based architectures, are used for rapid flow-field prediction, mapping geometry and flow conditions to detailed velocity and pressure distributions, offering substantial speedups over CFD simulations [8,13]. Simpler networks like ESCNN predict specific coefficients such as the lift coefficient $C _ { l }$ from geometry and angle of attack [20]. Beyond prediction, generative models like diffusion models enable multi-objective airfoil design by directly generating geometries conditioned on desired performance targets, framing optimization as a generation task [14]. For larger structures like aircraft wings, ML is employed in design optimization, including integrated multi-fidelity structural optimization for UAV wings [29]. ML also extends to the optimization of rotary-wing aerodynamics for improved performance [16].​  

Predicting complex flow phenomena, including turbulence, separation, and shock waves, is a critical area where ML shows immense promise compared to traditional CFD, which often struggles with accuracy and efficiency in these regimes [13]. Various ML architectures have been explored for flow-field prediction, including CNNs using geometry representations like Signed Distance Functions (SDF) [18], Transformer networks demonstrating improved generalization and interpretability [13], and ViT-based models employing multi-level loss functions to enhance accuracy in shock-wave regions [8]. Hybrid deep neural networks are also utilized for modeling unsteady flow fields around moving boundaries [1]. A closely related application is the prediction of aerodynamic heating for high-speed vehicles, where CNNs, specifically U-Net architectures with skip connections, have demonstrated higher accuracy for complex geometries compared to simpler encoder–decoder models [6].  

Different ML approaches offer distinct strengths and weaknesses when addressing specific aerodynamic challenges [8,13,18]. Predictive surrogate models based on CNNs, Transformers, or ViTs excel at learning the mapping from design parameters and flow conditions to aerodynamic responses or flow fields, providing rapid evaluation capabilities ideal for design iteration and optimization loops. Generative models are powerful for inverse design problems, directly creating designs that satisfy specified performance criteria [14]. Techniques like Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate physical laws directly into the model training, promising improved physical consistency and efficacy for inverse problems and situations with limited data [1]. Furthermore, ML enables data-driven turbulence modeling [3] and learning aerodynamic models directly from flight data [1]. The emerging field of Intelligent Fluid Mechanics encompasses these integrations, outlining a systematic process for developing data-driven simulation and prediction models [1].  

Analyzing the trade-offs between model complexity, prediction accuracy, and computational cost is crucial. While complex deep-learning models like ViT or U-Net can achieve high accuracy, especially for capturing intricate phenomena or complex geometries [6,8], they often require substantial computational resources and large datasets for training. However, once trained, these models can offer dramatic speedups in inference compared to traditional simulations. Simpler models may be faster but potentially less accurate for highly complex scenarios [20]. The selection of the appropriate ML approach depends on the specific task, required accuracy, available data, and computational budget.​  

Despite significant progress, challenges remain in using ML models for aerodynamic design and prediction. A major challenge is the reliance on extensive high-fidelity simulation or experimental data for training, which can be costly to acquire [6]. Ensuring robustness and generalization to unseen conditions, including geometries, flow parameters, or offdesign flight envelopes, is critical for safety-critical aerospace applications [8,13]. Handling high-dimensional design spaces in optimization tasks also presents complexity. Furthermore, ensuring physical consistency and interpretability of ML predictions is an active area of research [1,13]. Future directions include developing more data-efficient learning methods, integrating physics-informed approaches (like PINNs) to improve robustness and reduce data dependency, enhancing generalization capabilities, and exploring advanced techniques for flow control and 3D field reconstruction [1,3]. The application of AI for controlling turbulent boundary layers using techniques like genetic algorithms highlights the potential of ML beyond simulation and prediction, directly impacting performance metrics like drag reduction [1].  

# 3.1 Airfoil Design and Optimization  

Machine learning techniques have emerged as powerful tools for addressing complex challenges in airfoil design and optimization, offering the potential to accelerate traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and explore novel design spaces. Various ML algorithms are being employed for tasks ranging from flow field prediction to generative design conditioned on desired performance metrics.  

One significant area of application is the prediction of aerodynamic characteristics and flow fields based on airfoil geometry and flow conditions. Models based on Transformer networks, for instance, have demonstrated capability in encoding complex airfoil geometries and mapping these, fused with physical parameters like Reynolds number and angle of attack, to predicted flow fields, exhibiting strong generalization across different airfoil shapes [13]. Similarly, ViT-based encoderdecoder architectures, such as the "东方·御风" model, are utilized for efficient and accurate prediction of velocity and pressure fields around airfoils, including complex supercritical profiles [8]. These predictive models take airfoil geometry and flow parameters (e.g., angle of attack, Mach number) as input and output detailed flow field data, enabling rapid evaluation of diverse designs without resorting to computationally expensive CFD simulations [8]. Furthermore, simpler models like the ESCNN have been successfully applied to predict specific performance metrics, such as the lift coefficient ( $C _ { l }$ ), based on airfoil coordinates and angle of attack, trained on datasets of thousands of samples [20]. Physics-informed machine learning tools, such as NeuralFoil, also contribute to airfoil aerodynamics analysis by integrating physical principles into the learning process [33].​  

Beyond predictive tasks, ML is increasingly used for generative airfoil design and direct optimization. Diffusion models, for example, facilitate multi-objective generative airfoil design, where the model generates airfoil geometries conditioned directly on desired aerodynamic performance metrics like buffet lift coefficient and cruise drag coefficient [14]. This approach frames optimization as a generation problem, aiming to satisfy multiple objectives simultaneously by manipulating geometric design variables based on performance targets [14]. Generally, neural networks are proposed for optimizing airfoil shapes and parameters to enhance performance and reduce costs [10]. These ML-based methods accelerate the optimization process significantly compared to traditional iterative methods and facilitate the exploration of new, potentially unconventional, design spaces [8].​  

Comparing different ML approaches reveals distinct advantages. Predictive models like those based on Transformer or ViT architectures excel at learning the complex, non-linear mapping between shape, flow conditions, and full flow fields [8,13]. Their accuracy and efficiency offer substantial computational cost savings for design evaluation compared to traditional methods [8]. Generative models, such as diffusion models, directly tackle the inverse problem of design, enabling the generation of shapes that meet specific performance criteria, which is highly valuable in multi-objective design scenarios [14]. While model complexity varies across these approaches (e.g., deep networks vs. simpler models), the trade-off typically involves higher prediction accuracy and broader applicability (like full flow field prediction) coming at the cost of increased computational resources for training and potentially inference latency compared to traditional simplified methods, though still offering significant speed-ups over high-fidelity simulations [8]. The integration of these ML techniques into the overall design workflow holds considerable promise for revolutionizing the efficiency and creativity of airfoil design processes.​  

# 3.2 Wing Design and Analysis  

Machine learning is increasingly applied to the complex task of aircraft wing design and analysis, aiming to optimize aerodynamic performance, structural integrity, and overall efficiency for diverse flight conditions. Tools such as AeroSandbox, which utilizes computational graph transformations for aircraft design optimization across aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, and trajectory, provide frameworks amenable to integrating machine learning approaches [33].  

Research in this domain includes the application of machine learning specifically for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wing design. Studies have explored a "Low-Fidelity Rapid Wing Design Optimization Approach" and "Integrated Multi-fidelity Structural Optimization" for UAV wings, demonstrating the potential of ML to expedite the design process and enhance structural performance [29]. The focus on integrated multi-fidelity structural optimization implies the use of ML to reduce wing weight while maintaining or improving structural integrity, thereby contributing to enhanced aircraft performance and potentially fuel efficiency, although specific comparative performance metrics with traditional designs are not detailed in the provided digests. Further research in UAV wing design utilizing advanced techniques is also an active area of study [3].  

Beyond fixed-wing aircraft, machine learning techniques are also employed in the optimization of rotor designs, a critical component for helicopters and other rotary-wing aircraft. This application involves optimizing aerodynamic and acoustic performance characteristics, as evidenced by research focused on applying ML to optimize rotor design [16]. This highlights the versatility of ML in optimizing lifting surfaces across different aircraft types.​  

# 3.3 Flow Field Prediction  

Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods face significant challenges in accurately and efficiently predicting complex flow fields, particularly in capturing phenomena such as turbulence, separation, and shock waves, while requiring substantial computational resources and time [13]. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising avenue to accelerate or even potentially replace traditional CFD simulations, addressing these limitations [8,18]. The application of deep learning models has been explored to predict and simulate aerodynamic characteristics, aiming to improve design efficiency [10].  

Various ML approaches have been investigated for flow field prediction. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been employed to predict aerodynamic flow fields around airfoils, mapping input geometric representations to pressure distribution and velocity fields [18]. Variants like encoder-decoder and U-Net architectures have been applied to predict heat flux distribution on hypersonic vehicle surfaces, a task closely related to flow field analysis, with U-Net demonstrating higher accuracy for complex geometries [6]. The self-attention mechanism inherent in Transformer networks has been leveraged for flow field prediction around airfoils, enabling the model to effectively capture near-wall flow data and focus on important geometric information while reducing attention on irrelevant regions [13]. A ViT-based encoder-decoder model has also been utilized for flow field prediction around airfoils, predicting velocity and pressure fields based on airfoil geometry, angle of attack (AOA), and Mach number [8]. Furthermore, hybrid deep neural networks have been developed to model the evolution of unsteady flow fields around moving boundaries by learning the relationship between the flow field and boundary positions at successive time steps [1].  

The ability of these ML models to capture complex flow phenomena varies with architecture and training strategies. The Transformer network's self-attention mechanism is particularly effective in focusing on critical areas like near-wall regions [13]. Capturing shock waves accurately is a notable challenge; the ViT-based encoder-decoder model addresses this using a multi-level wavelet transform loss function to improve prediction accuracy specifically in shockwave regions [8]. Hybrid deep neural networks have shown high accuracy in simulating complex unsteady flows, such as those around a forced oscillation cylinder, demonstrating their potential for dynamic flow field prediction [1].​  

The choice of input representation plays a crucial role in capturing the geometry effectively. Studies have explored using the Signed Distance Function (SDF) of the airfoil geometry as input features for CNNs, demonstrating its utility in encoding geometric information for flow field prediction [18]. Other models utilize airfoil coordinates or 3D geometric representations directly, combined with flow conditions like Reynolds number, angle of attack, and Mach number [6,8,13]. The effectiveness of these representations depends on the specific ML architecture and the complexity of the geometry and flow regime being modeled.​  

Evaluation of these models often involves comparison against ground truth data generated by traditional CFD simulations. The ViT-based model, for instance, achieves industrial-grade accuracy while providing a significant speedup of 24x compared to CFD [8]. Similarly, hybrid deep neural networks demonstrate high accuracy when compared to CFD simulation results for unsteady flows [1]. CNN models for aerodynamic heating are also evaluated based on their prediction accuracy and computational efficiency relative to CFD [6]. The Transformer network has demonstrated good generalization capabilities [13]. While these results indicate significant progress in terms of speed and accuracy for specific applications, potential limitations lie in their generalization to complex, unseen geometries or flow conditions beyond the training data, the need for vast amounts of high-fidelity CFD data for training, and the difficulty in ensuring physical consistency and robustness across all scenarios. Future work includes exploring advanced architectures better suited for specific complex phenomena, developing more data-efficient training methods, and integrating physical constraints into ML models to enhance robustness and interpretability. Research into fast reconstruction of 3D physical fields also contributes to advancing the capabilities in this domain [3].  

# 3.4 Aerodynamic Heating Prediction  

Predicting aerodynamic heating is a critical aspect of designing high-speed aircraft and hypersonic vehicles, and machine learning approaches, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown promise in this domain [6]. Research has explored the application of CNNs specifically for predicting aerodynamic heating in hypersonic vehicles [6].  

Various CNN architectures have been investigated for this task. Among them, encoder-decoder and U-Net models represent two distinct approaches [6]. While the encoder-decoder architecture processes input through downsampling layers to extract features before upsampling to generate the output prediction, the U-Net architecture incorporates skip connections that transfer feature maps from the encoder path directly to the decoder path at corresponding resolution levels. This allows the U-Net to retain fine-grained spatial information lost during downsampling in the encoder, which is particularly beneficial for tasks requiring precise pixel-wise predictions, such as detailed surface heat flux maps. Performance evaluation considering prediction accuracy and computational cost has indicated that the U-Net model tends to demonstrate higher accuracy, especially when dealing with complex geometries [6].  

The effectiveness of these models is significantly influenced by the input data representation. Studies typically utilize training datasets derived from high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations [6]. These simulations provide comprehensive surface data for various hypersonic vehicle geometries [6]. The way geometric information and flow field properties are encoded into input tensors for the CNNs is crucial, although specific details on the impact of different geometric representations on prediction accuracy require further comparative analysis beyond existing summaries.  

Evaluating ML models for aerodynamic heating involves considering the trade-offs between model complexity, computational cost, and prediction accuracy [6]. More complex models, such as the U-Net with its skip connections, may offer enhanced accuracy for intricate geometries [6], but they might also incur higher computational costs during training and inference compared to simpler architectures. Researchers must balance the need for high predictive performance against the computational resources available.​  

A key limitation in current aerodynamic heating prediction using supervised ML models, particularly those trained on CFD data, is their reliance on the fidelity and coverage of the simulation data [6]. CFD simulations, while powerful, come with inherent assumptions and computational expenses. Furthermore, discrepancies between simulation results and real-world conditions can limit the generalizability of models trained solely on CFD data. Future research avenues should explore incorporating experimental data to validate and augment CFD-based training sets, thereby improving robustness and reliability. Additionally, the integration of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which embed physical laws into the network architecture or loss function, represents a promising direction to potentially reduce the reliance on large datasets and improve physical consistency in predictions [6].  

# 3.5 Aerodynamic Modeling  

Machine learning techniques are increasingly being explored and applied to augment or directly replace traditional methods for aerodynamic modeling, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and system identification [1,6,8,20]. A prevalent application involves creating data-driven surrogate models that approximate the outputs of computationally expensive simulations or physical phenomena. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been utilized to develop data-driven models for predicting aerodynamic heating on hypersonic vehicles, effectively serving as surrogates for traditional CFD simulations [6]. Similarly, neural networks, such as the custom-designed Element Spatial Convolution Neural Network (ESCNN), have been employed to predict specific aerodynamic parameters like the lift coefficient $( C _ { l } )$ for airfoils, trained on extensive datasets generated from CFD solvers like Xfoil [20]. Another example is the "东方·御风" model, which functions as a surrogate to predict flow fields and aerodynamic coefficients, trained on CFD data of supercritical airfoils [8]. Beyond full surrogate models, data-driven approaches are also being applied to specific components within traditional simulations, such as data-driven turbulence modeling, which can augment or potentially replace classical turbulence closure models [3]. Furthermore, machine learning facilitates learning aerodynamic models directly from experimental or flight data. A notable approach is the use of physics neural networks, like the attitude dynamics network, capable of identifying aerodynamic models end-to-end from flight data without requiring prior analytical aerodynamic knowledge [1].​  

Compared to traditional methods like high-fidelity CFD simulations, machine learning-based surrogate models offer significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency. Once trained, these models can predict aerodynamic properties or flow fields orders of magnitude faster than running a new CFD simulation for each query, making them suitable for realtime applications, rapid design exploration, and optimization loops. The accuracy of these ML models is heavily dependent on the quality and coverage of the training data, which is often generated from traditional methods like CFD [6,8,20]. Models trained on large datasets covering a wide range of parameters, such as the 15678 samples covering diverse airfoil types and angles of attack used for $C _ { l }$ ​ prediction [20], aim to achieve accuracy comparable to the data source within the training domain. However, a direct quantitative comparison of accuracy and efficiency across different ML models and against various traditional methods requires detailed study-specific benchmarks, which are not uniformly provided across general digests.​  

A significant challenge in training machine learning models for aerodynamic modeling is the potential limitation of available data, especially when relying on expensive CFD simulations or scarce flight test data. While generating large synthetic datasets from CFD is a common strategy [6,8,20], it still requires substantial computational resources and careful selection of the parameter space to ensure relevance and coverage. Generalization capability, the ability of the trained model to accurately predict results for unseen geometries, flow conditions, or flight envelopes, remains a key concern. Strategies to improve generalization include using diverse training data covering the operational envelope, incorporating physical constraints or knowledge into the network architecture (e.g., physics-informed neural networks, although not explicitly detailed in these digests, are a relevant technique), or employing techniques like transfer learning or active learning to efficiently expand the training dataset where the model shows high uncertainty. Learning directly from potentially noisy and sparse flight data [1] presents unique challenges related to data quality, sensor noise, and the need for robust model identification methods that can generalize beyond observed flight trajectories. Addressing these data limitations and enhancing generalization are critical for the widespread adoption of ML in safety-critical aerodynamic applications.  

# 3.6 ML in Intelligent Fluid Mechanics  

The integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) with fluid mechanics has given rise to the emerging field of intelligent fluid mechanics (IFM), which holds significant potential for addressing complex challenges within the discipline [1]. A key application of ML in this domain involves constructing data-driven models capable of simulating and predicting fluid behavior. The development of such models typically follows a systematic process encompassing five principal stages: problem formulation, data collection, architecture selection, loss function design, and optimization algorithm implementation [1]. These data-driven approaches have demonstrated efficacy in various applications, including predicting flow fields around aerodynamic shapes using architectures like the Transformer network [8,13], estimating aerodynamic coefficients such as the lift coefficient [20], and enabling rapid prediction of aerodynamic heating using convolutional neural networks [6].  

Beyond purely data-driven methods, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent an advanced technique that integrates physical laws, such as those derived from the Navier–Stokes equations, directly into the neural network architecture and training process [1,20]. PINNs are particularly valuable for solving inverse flow problems, which often pose considerable difficulties for traditional computational fluid dynamics methods [1]. Furthermore, AI techniques are being applied to active flow control strategies, notably for managing turbulent boundary layers to achieve objectives like friction drag reduction. In this context, genetic algorithms have been successfully employed for the unsupervised learning of optimal control policies, guiding actuators like synthetic jets to manipulate flow dynamics [1]. This section will delve into these applications, exploring the theoretical frameworks and practical implementations of ML techniques, including PINNs and AI-driven control strategies, within the field of intelligent fluid mechanics.​  

# 3.6.1 Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Fluid Mechanics  

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a significant development in flow physics-informed learning, offering an approach that seamlessly integrates both data and mathematical models for simulating fluid dynamics problems [1]. This integration addresses certain challenges encountered by traditional numerical methods in simulating complex flow phenomena. PINNs achieve this integration by incorporating physical knowledge—typically derived from governing equations such as the Navier–Stokes equations—as constraints directly within the neural network’s training process [20]. This contrasts with purely data-driven approaches and aims to enforce adherence to physical laws. A key strength highlighted for PINNs is their effectiveness in solving inverse problems, which are often computationally intensive or illposed for traditional methods [1]. The utility of PINNs has been demonstrated across various fluid mechanics applications, including the analysis of three-dimensional wake flows, supersonic flows, and complex biomedical flows [1].  

# 3.6.2 AI Control of Turbulent Boundary Layers  

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant potential for controlling turbulent boundary layers, primarily aimed at reducing friction drag in aerodynamic applications [1]. A typical AI control system designed for this purpose comprises several key components. These include sensors to monitor the flow state, actuators to influence the boundary layer dynamics, and an AI-based controller that processes sensor data and generates control signals for the actuators [1]. Synthetic jets are highlighted as a specific type of actuator commonly employed in these systems due to their ability to inject or entrain fluid without net mass addition [1]. For determining optimal control strategies, genetic algorithms have been effectively utilized. These algorithms facilitate the unsupervised learning of optimal control laws by iteratively evolving potential solutions based on performance metrics, such as achieved drag reduction [1]. Research in this area has shown promising experimental results, demonstrating the potential for significant drag reduction through the implementation of these AI-driven control strategies [1].​  

# 4. Machine Learning for Flight Performance Prediction and Monitoring  

Machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly being leveraged to address complex challenges in aircraft performance prediction and monitoring. This field encompasses the application of data-driven methodologies to model, analyze, and optimize various aspects of flight, ranging from fundamental aerodynamic forces to overall flight planning, control, and system health. By capturing intricate, often non-linear relationships within vast datasets, ML models offer the potential for more accurate, efficient, and adaptive performance analysis compared to traditional physics-based or empirical methods [20].​

A foundational area where ML is applied is the prediction of aerodynamic forces, such as lift $( C _ { L } )$ and drag. Accurate estimation of these forces is critical as they directly influence fuel efficiency, structural integrity, and the operational envelope of an aircraft. Different ML approaches have emerged for this task. Some models focus on the direct prediction of aerodynamic coefficients based on inputs like airfoil geometry and flight conditions, such as angle of attack $( \alpha )$ [20]. Other methods aim to predict the underlying flow fields around aircraft components, from which lift and drag can be subsequently derived [8]. These models take into account factors like airfoil geometry, angle of attack, and Mach number, highlighting the necessity of diverse input features to accurately capture aerodynamic behavior across varying conditions [8,20].​  

Beyond fundamental aerodynamics, ML plays a significant role in optimizing operational performance metrics such as fuel consumption and flight range [31]. Accurate prediction of fuel burn under diverse operating conditions, informed by historical flight data and external factors like weather forecasts, enables the optimization of flight paths to minimize fuel usage and associated environmental impact [25,31]. This directly supports improved flight planning and range estimation. Furthermore, the principles of energy estimation, fundamental to range prediction, are applicable across different propulsion systems, including emerging electric aircraft, suggesting the adaptability of ML methodologies [22].  

Flight path optimization itself is a critical application area, where ML algorithms are used to determine the most efficient routes. These methods are particularly valuable for incorporating dynamic and uncertain elements, such as variable wind conditions aloft, into the planning process [25]. By balancing exploration of new paths with exploitation of known efficient routes, ML can find robustly optimal trajectories in the face of environmental uncertainties [25]. This contributes to enhanced flight efficiency and safety.​  

Machine learning also finds extensive application in modeling aircraft flight dynamics and designing advanced control systems. Techniques like Reinforcement Learning (RL) are explored for synthesizing control and guidance laws, enabling systems to learn complex mappings from flight states to control inputs [7,32]. This includes developing integrated controllers that handle multiple degrees of freedom simultaneously [7] or adaptive guidance systems capable of reacting to dynamic scenarios like target maneuvers [32]. The integration of learning paradigms like Imitation Learning (IL) can further enhance the efficiency of training complex control policies [32]. Such data-driven approaches contribute to improved stability, handling qualities, and potentially enhanced flight safety [10,23]. Additionally, ML is applied to predict the health and longevity of critical components like aero engines, contributing to proactive maintenance and safety monitoring [4].​  

The effectiveness of these ML models is heavily contingent on the quality and relevance of the input data and the sophistication of feature engineering. Accurately capturing the complex interactions between aircraft design parameters, flight conditions, and performance metrics necessitates comprehensive datasets and carefully selected or engineered features [20]. Diverse ML models, including neural networks, transformers, and reinforcement learning agents, exhibit different strengths in capturing these complex relationships, making model selection crucial for specific performance prediction and monitoring tasks.​  

Despite significant progress, challenges remain. These include ensuring model generalization to unseen operating conditions and complex interactions, addressing data scarcity and quality issues, integrating real-time dynamic data streams (e.g., weather, air traffic control constraints) into planning and control loops, and enhancing the robustness and interpretability of ML models for safety-critical applications. Future research directions involve refining models for broader operational envelopes, comparing the trade-offs between different ML methodologies in terms of accuracy and computational cost, and developing methods for robust adaptive control and intelligent decision-making in highly dynamic environments [23]. Integrating these data-driven insights seamlessly into existing flight planning, monitoring, and control systems represents a continuous area of development.​  

# 4.1 Lift and Drag Prediction  

The accurate prediction of aerodynamic forces, specifically lift and drag, constitutes a cornerstone in aircraft design and performance analysis [20]. These forces dictate critical aspects such as fuel efficiency, structural loads, stability, and overall flight envelope. Machine learning techniques offer promising avenues for rapidly predicting these parameters, potentially accelerating the design cycle compared to traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or experimental methods.  

Various machine learning models have been explored for this task, differing in their architecture, inputs, and prediction targets. One approach focuses on the direct prediction of aerodynamic coefficients. For instance, the ESCNN model is specifically designed to predict lift coefficients $\left( C _ { L } \right)$ ) by taking airfoil coordinates and the angle of attack $( \alpha )$ as input features [20]. The model processes these geometric and flow condition inputs to output a predicted lift coefficient [20].  

A distinct methodology involves predicting the underlying flow fields from which lift and drag can be subsequently calculated. The "东方·御风" model, employing a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based encoder–decoder architecture trained on CFD data, exemplifies this approach [8]. This model accepts airfoil geometry and flow conditions, including angle of attack and Mach number, as inputs and predicts the pressure and velocity fields around the airfoil [8]. The lift and drag coefficients can then be derived by integrating the predicted pressure and shear stress distributions over the airfoil surface [8]. This indirect method provides richer information about the flow physics compared to predicting coefficients directly, albeit potentially requiring more computational resources and data.​  

The performance and accuracy of these machine learning models are inherently influenced by various factors, which are incorporated as input parameters. Airfoil geometry is a fundamental determinant of aerodynamic characteristics, and models utilize airfoil coordinates or geometry representations as inputs [8,20]. Similarly, flow conditions such as angle of attack are critical inputs that significantly impact lift and drag, and both the ESCNN and "东方·御风" models explicitly include angle of attack [8,20]. The "东方·御风" model further incorporates the Mach number, acknowledging its importance in compressible flow regimes [8]. While the provided digests highlight these factors as inputs, detailed analyses of how variations in Reynolds number or complex interactions between geometry and flow conditions specifically affect the models' accuracy, computational efficiency, or generalization ability across diverse operating envelopes are areas requiring deeper investigation [20]. Comparing the computational cost and generalization capability of models predicting coefficients directly versus those predicting flow fields represents an important aspect for future research in deploying these techniques effectively in industrial workflows.  

# 4.2 Fuel Consumption and Range Estimation  

Accurate estimation of fuel consumption and achievable range is of paramount economic and environmental importance in the aviation industry. Reducing fuel burn directly impacts airline operating costs and significantly contributes to lowering greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with sustainability objectives. The complex, often non-linear relationships between aircraft operating conditions (such as altitude, speed, payload, and control inputs), engine performance characteristics, and actual fuel consumption pose significant challenges for traditional modeling approaches. Machine learning models offer a powerful capability to capture these intricate dependencies by learning directly from extensive operational data.​  

The application of machine learning for fuel optimization is recognized as a key area [31]. By developing models that accurately predict fuel consumption under a wide array of operational scenarios, researchers and operators can gain valuable insights. These predictions are instrumental in optimizing flight trajectories, enabling the identification and utilization of routes that minimize fuel burn. Such route optimization directly leads to reduced operational costs and a smaller environmental footprint. For instance, approaches that reduce flight time through optimization, potentially leveraging accurate weather forecasts like wind data, inherently contribute to more efficient fuel utilization and an extension of effective range [25]. The explicit application of machine learning to estimate and minimize fuel consumption is directly linked to the problem of range estimation [31].  

Effective and accurate machine learning models for fuel and range estimation necessitate the integration of diverse datasets. Crucially, this includes historical flight data detailing operational parameters, coupled with external data sources such as weather information [31]. Accurate wind forecasts, for example, are vital inputs for optimizing flight paths to enhance fuel efficiency [25].  

Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of these machine learning models across varying flight conditions and operational envelopes is a critical aspect of their development and deployment. While ML techniques show considerable promise, identifying potential sources of error—including issues related to data quality, the model's ability to generalize to unseen conditions, or unexpected operational edge cases—remains an ongoing challenge and an important area for future research. Enhancing model robustness, interpretability, and seamless integration into real-time flight planning and decisionmaking systems are key areas for continued investigation. The ability to accurately assess range is also fundamental when considering alternative propulsion systems, such as electric aircraft. In this domain, achievable range is determined by factors like battery pack-level specific energy and empty weight fraction, evaluated relative to current aircraft performance benchmarks [22]. The principle that energy requirements increase with range highlights the importance of accurate prediction regardless of the energy source, suggesting opportunities for adapting ML methodologies to model performance in diverse propulsion systems [22].  

# 4.3 Flight Path Optimization  

Optimizing flight paths is a crucial aspect of enhancing aircraft performance, particularly in terms of efficiency and environmental impact [31]. Machine learning (ML) approaches are increasingly being explored to find optimal flight paths, offering potential advantages over traditional flight planning methods by better adapting to dynamic conditions. A core challenge in flight path optimization is the incorporation of uncertain variables, such as wind conditions aloft, and dynamic constraints, including air traffic control requirements and real-time weather updates.  

One significant application of machine learning in this domain involves optimizing flight routes by improving the consideration of wind aloft forecasts and aircraft routing [25]. ML algorithms are particularly adept at handling the inherent uncertainty present in these wind forecasts. Specifically, research has demonstrated that ML methods can effectively seek the fastest route to a destination by explicitly addressing the uncertainty in predicted wind conditions [25]. This is achieved by optimally balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation [25]. Exploration involves searching for potentially better, undiscovered routes, while exploitation focuses on utilizing known good routes based on current information. Machine learning provides frameworks that can weigh the potential benefits of exploring new paths against the reliability of exploiting existing knowledge, leading to more robustly optimal routes in the face of environmental uncertainties [25].​  

While the primary focus based on the available digests is on leveraging ML to handle wind uncertainty and optimize routing through exploration–exploitation strategies, further research is needed to comprehensively address the challenges of integrating real-time data streams for weather and the complex, dynamic constraints imposed by air traffic control regulations into ML-based flight path optimization algorithms. Tools like MSFS2020-PilotPathRecorder, which records flight data and paths, highlight the availability of empirical data that could potentially be used to train and evaluate such advanced ML optimization models [33]. However, the specific details of different ML approaches, their comparative effectiveness against traditional methods, and comprehensive strategies for incorporating real-time ATC and weather challenges were not extensively detailed in the provided materials, suggesting areas for future exploration and synthesis in the field.​  

# 4.4 Flight Dynamics and Control  

Machine learning techniques are increasingly applied to model aircraft flight dynamics and design control systems, offering potential advantages in handling complex dynamics and adapting to uncertainties. One significant area of application is in the synthesis of control and guidance laws. Reinforcement learning (RL) stands out as a prominent machine learning approach explored for this purpose [7,32].​  

Different RL-based approaches have been investigated for distinct control problems. For internal aircraft control, deep reinforcement learning has been employed to develop an end-to-end integrated intelligent controller for fixed-wing aircraft [7]. This controller directly maps flight states to control inputs, such as rudder surface deflections and thrust, deviating from traditional methods that typically separate trajectory and attitude control loops [7]. The objective is to achieve stable cruise flight, specifically aiming for near-zero sideslip by incorporating yaw angle error into the controller input [7]. This demonstrates the potential of RL for learning complex, coupled control policies directly from state observations.  

In contrast, RL has also been applied to external guidance problems, such as developing guidance laws for intercepting maneuvering targets [32]. This involves controlling a missile's flight path to intercept an aircraft performing evasive maneuvers [32]. To enhance initial learning efficiency in this complex dynamic environment, imitation learning (IL) is combined with RL [32]. Expert trajectories are used to pre-train the agent via IL, which accelerates convergence during the subsequent RL phase where the policy is fine-tuned for optimal interception performance [32]. This highlights the benefit of integrating different learning paradigms to address challenges in specific control tasks. While these digests focus on RL, research also encompasses other areas like unsteady aerodynamic modeling and parameter identification at high angles of attack [23], which are crucial for accurate dynamics representation.​  

The robustness and adaptability of machine learning-based control systems are critical considerations. For instance, the $R L + 1 L$ guidance law is designed to handle the uncertainty introduced by a target performing evasive maneuvers, showcasing the ability of learning-based methods to adapt to dynamic environments [32]. Furthermore, research in related forums covers anti-disturbance control technology, including methods based on disturbance observers for low-altitude UAVs [23], which aligns with the broader goal of making data-driven control systems robust to external factors. Parameter identification, another topic discussed, is also vital for adapting control systems to changing flight conditions [23].  

Machine learning algorithms are integrated into flight control systems to improve performance metrics such as stability and handling qualities. The end-to-end deep RL controller, by directly learning a policy for stable cruise with near-zero sideslip, inherently contributes to improved stability and potentially handling [7]. Discussions around intelligent decision making within flight control contexts further suggest the potential for ML to optimize overall system behavior [23].  

Reinforcement learning is particularly valuable for adaptive flight control, enabling aircraft to learn and refine optimal control strategies in real-time or near-real-time [7,23,32]. The application of deep RL for integrated control [7] and the $R L + 1 L$ approach for adaptive guidance against maneuvering targets [32] both exemplify this capability, demonstrating how agents can learn complex mappings from states to actions or adapt their policy to dynamic, unpredictable environments. This datadriven approach holds promise for enhancing autonomous flight capabilities.  

# 5. Machine Learning for Aircraft Performance in Specific Flight Regimes  

The application of machine learning (ML) techniques presents significant opportunities to enhance aircraft performance and safety across various flight regimes, from takeoff and landing to cruise. By analyzing vast datasets, ML models can provide more accurate predictions, optimize operational parameters, and contribute to the development of advanced decision support systems for aircrews and air traffic control. This section provides an overview of how ML is being leveraged within distinct phases of flight, highlighting its potential to improve efficiency, mitigate risks, and support autonomous capabilities [8,23,25,31].​  

During critical phases such as takeoff and landing, ML contributes to accurate performance prediction, which is vital for ensuring safety and operational efficiency. It facilitates the analysis of large-scale operational and safety data, including insights into events like runway incursions and unstable approaches, thereby supporting safer procedures and the creation of robust decision support tools [31]. Furthermore, ML is relevant to advanced flight control systems under external disturbances and the performance of specialized maneuvers and vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) operations [23].  

In the cruise phase, ML applications focus on optimizing efficiency and minimizing environmental impact. This includes enhancing aerodynamic designs, such as optimizing supercritical airfoils critical for high-speed flight, through industrialgrade fluid simulation models powered by AI [8]. ML also enables dynamic, real-time route optimization based on environmental conditions like wind forecasts, aiming to improve both speed and fuel efficiency during cruise, thus contributing to reduced fuel consumption and emissions [25]. Across all regimes, ML holds promise for detecting and predicting potential hazards, such as wind shear during landing or turbulence during cruise, by analyzing real-time and historical data, thereby enhancing overall flight safety and robustness against disturbances [23,31]. The subsequent sections delve into the specific applications and challenges within the takeoff and landing, and cruise regimes in greater detail.​  

# 5.1 Takeoff and Landing Performance  

Accurate prediction of aircraft performance during takeoff and landing is critical for ensuring safety and optimizing operational efficiency. Machine learning holds significant potential to enhance the precision of these predictions by leveraging vast amounts of operational data. Furthermore, machine learning techniques can contribute to the development of advanced decision support tools for aircrews and air traffic control personnel, aiding in critical judgments during these phases [31].​  

The analysis of large datasets related to airport operations, for instance, can provide insights into safety-critical events such as runway and taxiway incursions, which are directly relevant to the takeoff and landing environment [31]. Utilizing big data analytics in this context, as highlighted by research in the field [31], enables a data-driven understanding of risks and operational factors influencing these phases.​  

While the direct application to improving the accuracy of performance calculation models through ML is a primary area of interest, the analysis of associated operational and safety data through such methods also contributes to the overall understanding and management of takeoff and landing procedures, supporting safer and more efficient operations and potentially informing the development of more robust decision support systems.  

# 5.2 Cruise Performance  

Optimizing aircraft performance during the cruise phase is critical for maximizing efficiency and minimizing environmental impact. Machine learning approaches offer promising avenues for identifying optimal cruise settings and improving  

aerodynamic designs based on real‐time conditions and performance objectives. One area of application involves the design and analysis of key aerodynamic components. For instance, the accurate prediction of flow fields around supercritical airfoils, which are essential for high‐speed cruise conditions, can be significantly enhanced using machine learning models [8]. Models like "东方·御风" are specifically developed for industrial‐grade fluid simulation, enabling optimized airfoil designs that contribute directly to improved cruise performance and efficiency [8].  

Beyond component design, machine learning also facilitates operational optimizations during cruise. By leveraging real‐ time data, such as wind forecasts, machine learning algorithms can optimize flight routes during the cruise segment [25]. This route optimization is explicitly aimed at improving both speed and, crucially, fuel efficiency during the critical cruise phase of flight, thereby contributing to a reduction in fuel consumption and associated emissions [25].​  

Collectively, the application of machine learning in optimizing aerodynamic designs and facilitating dynamic route adjustments based on environmental conditions represents a significant step towards achieving more fuel‐efficient and environmentally friendly aircraft operations during cruise.  

# 6. Machine Learning for Engine Performance and Control  

Machine learning techniques are increasingly being applied to critical aspects of aircraft engine operation, specifically in the domains of performance prediction and control. These applications aim to enhance operational efficiency, improve safety, optimize maintenance strategies, and potentially contribute to fuel efficiency gains. The subsequent sections delve into the state-of-the-art and challenges within these two principal areas.​  

The prediction of engine performance parameters and the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) represents a significant area of research. Machine learning models offer powerful tools for forecasting key indicators such as Exhaust Gas Temperature Margin (EGTM) or for predicting RUL based on condition monitoring data. Studies have explored various architectures, including integrated Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) for parameter prediction [11], Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for RUL prognostics used in maintenance scheduling [12], and Bayesian Graph Attention Transformers for probabilistic RUL prediction [4]. These methods leverage sensor data to learn complex relationships that serve as indicators of engine health and future performance capability, thereby supporting proactive maintenance and performance monitoring. However, accurately predicting performance and degradation across widely varying operating conditions and different levels of degradation remains a significant challenge [11]. While the provided digests discuss predicting performance parameters and RUL under degradation, detailed analyses of feature selection techniques for improving prediction accuracy and the direct application of performance prediction outputs for fuel efficiency optimization are not extensively covered.​  

In parallel with advances in performance prediction, machine learning is also transforming aero-engine control systems. Traditionally reliant on methods like PID control, modern approaches are exploring techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop more adaptive and intelligent controllers [9]. DRL enables control policies to be learned through interaction, potentially allowing engines to respond optimally to diverse flight conditions [9]. Specific DRL algorithms such as Q-learning, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) have been investigated for control tasks including fuel flow regulation and acceleration management across the flight envelope [9]. Despite the potential benefits in terms of adaptability and optimized control strategies [9], the deployment of DRL in safety-critical systems like aero-engines introduces substantial challenges related to safety, reliability, sample efficiency, and generalization ability [9]. Although the original source paper indicates that it discusses the advantages and disadvantages of DRL versus traditional methods and potential solutions for safety and reliability challenges, these specifics are not present in the provided digest. Addressing these concerns through robust verification, validation, the use of virtual learning environments, and the development of more resilient algorithms represents a crucial area for future research to enable the practical implementation of DRL-based engine controllers.  

In summary, machine learning offers powerful capabilities for both predicting engine performance and developing advanced control strategies.

Promising results have been demonstrated using models such as integrated ELM, CNN, and Bayesian Graph Attention Transformers for performance and RUL prediction, and DRL algorithms such as Q-learning, DDPG, and TD3 for control [4,9,11,12]. However, significant challenges remain, including achieving accurate predictions under variable conditions and degradation, rigorous validation and certification of DRL controllers, and ensuring their safety and reliability in real-world aviation environments. Future work must focus on developing more robust and interpretable ML models, enhancing data efficiency, and establishing comprehensive frameworks for the verification and validation of ML-based systems in safetycritical aerospace applications.  

# 6.1 Engine Performance Prediction  

Predicting engine performance is crucial for optimizing aircraft operation, ensuring safety, and facilitating proactive maintenance. Machine learning models have been increasingly applied to this task, targeting various aspects of engine health and performance [4,11,12].  

One direct application involves predicting specific engine performance parameters. For instance, the Exhaust Gas Temperature Margin (EGTM)—a key indicator of engine health and performance capability—has been predicted using an integrated Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model [11]. This study demonstrates the feasibility of employing ELM-based approaches for forecasting critical operational metrics [11].  

Closely related to performance prediction, particularly under degradation, is the prediction of Remaining Useful Life (RUL). RUL indicates how much longer an engine is expected to operate before requiring maintenance or retirement, directly reflecting the impact of degradation on future performance capacity. Various machine learning architectures have been utilized for RUL prediction based on condition monitoring and sensor data [4,12]. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model has been applied to predict the RUL of turbofan engines using condition monitoring data, with the output RUL used for maintenance scheduling [12]. Furthermore, a Bayesian Graph Attention Transformer has been employed for probabilistic RUL prediction, providing not only a point estimate but also a confidence interval—which is valuable for uncertainty quantification based on sensor data [4].​  

These approaches highlight the application of machine learning models such as integrated ELM, CNN, and Bayesian Graph Attention Transformers to address aspects of engine performance and degradation. While these studies demonstrate the potential of machine learning, challenges persist in accurately predicting performance under widely varying operating conditions and across different levels of engine degradation [11]. The RUL prediction models explicitly address the challenge posed by degradation by learning patterns from condition data [4,12].  

# 6.2 Engine Control  

The application of machine learning, particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), in the domain of aero-engine control presents a promising avenue for enhancing performance and adaptability [9]. Research has explored various DRL algorithms for this purpose, moving beyond traditional control methods [9].  

Specific DRL approaches have been investigated for engine control applications. Model-free Q-learning has been employed in engine control simulations, where fuel flow is designated as the control action [9]. A deep neural network is utilized in this context, taking various engine parameters as inputs to map action value functions, enabling the control system to learn optimal policies through interaction with the environment [9]. Another approach involves the use of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithms. To mitigate issues such as steady-state errors often encountered with neural network outputs, a complementary integrator is incorporated alongside the DDPG controller to provide necessary corrections [9]. Furthermore, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) has been applied to design acceleration controllers capable of operating across the full flight envelope [9]. This is achieved by partitioning the flight envelope into distinct regions, training a specific TD3 controller within each cluster region, and then utilizing linear interpolation techniques to extend the control strategy smoothly across the entire envelope [9].  

While DRL-based methods offer potential advantages, including the ability to learn complex, non-linear control policies directly from data or simulation, their deployment in safety-critical systems like aero-engines introduces significant challenges. These challenges are particularly pertinent concerning safety and reliability [9]. Ensuring the stability, predictability, and certifiability of DRL controllers is paramount for aviation applications. Although the source paper highlights that it discusses the advantages and disadvantages of DRL compared to traditional methods, and addresses challenges related to safety and reliability along with potential solutions, specific details regarding these comparisons, challenges, and solutions are not provided in the available digest [9]. Future research needs to rigorously address verification, validation, and robustness guarantees for DRL systems to facilitate their practical implementation in aeroengine control.​  

7. Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance and Fault Diagnosis  

![](images/fd23f79aa94400175a030c8ff998434acc9e264a7f77d3402c7b3847f4100251.jpg)  

Machine learning (ML) is transforming aircraft maintenance by enabling the proactive identification and diagnosis of potential issues, moving beyond traditional reactive or time-based approaches [2,5].  

![](images/0c540c868ddc6ef4e8aff9511b7157f006963d6bf9e8cdb60210dd9de86e5b3b.jpg)  

This shift is crucial for enhancing aviation safety, improving operational efficiency, and significantly reducing costly Aircraft on Ground (AOG) events and unscheduled maintenance [2,5]. ML algorithms analyze vast amounts of sensor data, maintenance records, and operational information to detect anomalies, predict component failures, estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL), and optimize maintenance schedules [2,4,5,12].  

The application of machine learning in this domain spans several key areas, including Aircraft Health Monitoring (AHM), Predictive Maintenance with a strong focus on RUL estimation, and Fault Diagnosis. AHM leverages ML to integrate diverse data sources, providing a holistic view of aircraft health and informing decision-making processes to minimize downtime [2]. Predictive maintenance, particularly RUL estimation, aims to forecast the operational lifespan of critical components, enabling condition-based maintenance strategies that optimize interventions [4,5]. Fault diagnosis focuses on the accurate identification and classification of anomalies or malfunctions based on observed data [15].  

Various machine learning models are employed depending on the specific task and data characteristics. For RUL prediction, techniques capable of handling time-series data and complex degradation patterns are essential, including regression  

models and deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [12]. Given the spatio-temporal nature of sensor data from complex systems like aero engines, advanced models combining spatial and temporal reasoning are gaining prominence. An example is the Bayesian Graph Attention Transformer, which integrates Graph Attention Networks (GATs) for modeling spatial dependencies between sensors and Transformer networks for capturing temporal dynamics, enhanced with Bayesian methods for uncertainty quantification [4]. For fault diagnosis, classification models are widely used, with efforts focused on improving their efficiency and real-time performance, such as enhancements to Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) through techniques like ​ϵ -Dragging Regularized ELM (D-RELM) and Improved D-RELM (ID-RELM) [15]. Commercial platforms like the SAS Platform and Ascentia demonstrate the integration of various AI and analytics methods, often combining ML with IoT and big data approaches to analyze extensive sensor data and maintenance histories for proactive fault identification and prediction [2,5].​  

Effective predictive maintenance and fault diagnosis heavily rely on the quality and analysis of complex data. Modern aircraft generate massive volumes of sensor data per flight hour, necessitating sophisticated feature extraction techniques [5]. Extracting meaningful features from this data, especially considering its inherent spatio-temporal characteristics, is a critical step. Methods like integrating GATs and Transformers are designed to jointly model the relationships between sensors and their evolution over time [4]. Beyond structured sensor data, integrating unstructured data such as maintenance notes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques also enhances fault diagnosis by identifying recurring issues and improving troubleshooting [2].​  

A pivotal aspect, particularly for RUL prediction in safety-critical applications, is the quantification of prediction uncertainty [4]. Point estimates alone are insufficient for risk-aware decision-making. Probabilistic predictions, often delivered through Bayesian methods like Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), provide a distribution of possible RUL values, enabling maintenance planning based on defined risk thresholds [4]. This explicit handling of uncertainty offers a more nuanced approach compared to implicit methods that rely solely on applying safety factors to point forecasts [4,12].  

These ML-based diagnostic and prognostic systems are integrated into maintenance scheduling frameworks in various ways. RUL prognostics can trigger maintenance alarms based on the predicted remaining time or its rate of change [12]. Alternatively, RUL distributions from probabilistic models directly inform optimized maintenance schedules by allowing planners to balance safety with operational costs based on likelihoods of failure [4]. Case studies highlight the tangible benefits, demonstrating significant reductions in downtime and maintenance costs compared to traditional approaches [5,12].​  

Despite the successes, implementing ML for aircraft predictive maintenance and fault diagnosis faces challenges. These include ensuring high data quality and managing sensor noise, addressing the interpretability of complex ML models, the complexities of integrating these systems into existing aviation operational frameworks, and the need for specialized expertise [2,5]. Balancing model complexity with the requirement for real-time performance, especially for fault diagnosis, remains an ongoing challenge [15]. Future research should continue to focus on robust data handling, developing more interpretable models, improving integration methodologies, and advancing uncertainty quantification techniques to build even more reliable and effective systems for aircraft performance and maintenance.  

# 7.1 Aircraft Health Monitoring (AHM) and Diagnostics  

Aircraft Health Monitoring (AHM) plays a critical role in enhancing aviation safety and operational efficiency by enabling proactive identification and diagnosis of potential issues. A key benefit of AHM, particularly when augmented by machine learning (ML), is the significant reduction of Aircraft on Ground (AOG) events [2]. By integrating AHM data with operational insights, platforms can track maintenance processes, predict necessary steps, and facilitate informed decision-making to minimize downtime and improve overall efficiency [2].  

Machine learning techniques are extensively applied in AHM to analyze flight data and maintenance records for predicting potential failures and optimizing maintenance schedules. Different ML approaches are employed depending on the specific diagnostic or prognostic task. For instance, predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of components, such as aircraft engines, often involves time-series analysis and regression models. These prognostics can then be used to trigger alarms based on their evolution over time, indicating potential issues and informing maintenance scheduling [12]. Another common application is the prediction of specific part failures based on historical flight data and maintenance actions like fault code triggers and part replacements. This can be framed as a classification problem (e.g., predicting whether a part will fail within a certain timeframe) or a regression problem (e.g., predicting the time until failure). Such systems learn from past events to improve the accuracy of future recommendations and potentially reduce unnecessary maintenance actions [5].  

The accuracy and reliability of these ML techniques are paramount for successful AHM deployment. While specific performance metrics like precision, recall, or F1-scores are not consistently detailed across all descriptions, the reported benefits highlight the effectiveness of these systems in practical scenarios. For example, predictive maintenance systems that learn from historical data aim to improve recommendations over time, suggesting a focus on learning and refinement [5]. The success in reducing AOG events and enhancing operational efficiency [2] implicitly relies on the system's ability to accurately detect or predict faults before they lead to critical failures or extensive downtime.​  

Several successful deployments demonstrate the practical value of ML-powered AHM in commercial and military aviation. Lockheed Martin's "intelligent diagnostics" service utilizes machine learning to analyze C-130J flight data to predict part failures, enabling customers to proactively manage parts inventory and maintain operational readiness for critical missions [5]. Similarly, the Ascentia platform illustrates the integration of AHM and AOG data for commercial airlines, providing tools to predict maintenance steps and minimize the impact of AOG events, directly contributing to operational efficiency [2].  

# 7.2 Predictive Maintenance and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation  

Machine learning plays a crucial role in advancing predictive maintenance capabilities within the aviation sector, particularly through the estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for critical aircraft components like aero engines [4]. This capability shifts maintenance paradigms from reactive or time-based schedules to condition-based strategies, optimizing operational efficiency and safety [2,5].​  

Effective RUL estimation heavily relies on analyzing complex operational and sensor data, which constitute the primary data sources. These datasets, such as the NASA CMAPSS and NCMAPSS datasets [4], capture intricate operational conditions and degradation patterns. The features derived from this data often possess both spatial and temporal dimensions, requiring sophisticated techniques to model dependencies between different sensors and their evolution over time. Extracting these spatio-temporal features is fundamental for accurately capturing component health states, as explored in subsequent sections. The sheer volume and complexity of sensor data from modern aircraft underscore the need for advanced feature extraction methodologies [5].​  

Various machine learning models have been employed for RUL prediction, ranging from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) capable of processing time-series data [12] to advanced models that integrate spatial and temporal reasoning, such as the Bayesian Graph Attention Transformer model designed for aero engines [4]. Evaluating the accuracy of these models is critical, although direct performance comparisons across diverse studies can be challenging due to variations in datasets, component types, and evaluation metrics. The ability of these models to predict RUL allows for the implementation of predictive maintenance strategies that optimize maintenance schedules by enabling proactive component replacement during planned downtimes, reducing the risk of in-flight failures and minimizing unscheduled maintenance and associated costs [2,5].​  

A pivotal aspect of reliable RUL estimation is the quantification of prediction uncertainty [4]. Point estimates alone are insufficient for safety-critical applications, as they do not convey the confidence level or potential variability in the prediction. Probabilistic predictions, which provide a distribution of possible RUL values, are therefore of paramount importance [4]. Methods for quantifying uncertainty include Bayesian networks and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), which can model uncertainty by treating model parameters probabilistically [4]. Techniques like variational inference are used to approximate the complex posterior distributions in such models, enabling the output of confidence intervals or probability distributions for RUL [4]. Quantifying uncertainty explicitly facilitates risk-aware decision-making, allowing maintenance planners to schedule interventions based on defined risk thresholds rather than relying solely on point forecasts or applying simplistic safety factors [4,12].​  

# 7.2.1 Spatio-Temporal Feature Extraction  

Effective Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction for aircraft components heavily relies on analyzing complex sensor data, which inherently possesses both spatial and temporal dimensions. Spatial relationships capture the dependencies and interactions between different sensors located across a component or system, which may not adhere to a simple Euclidean structure. Temporal relationships, conversely, represent the time-series evolution and degradation patterns captured by individual sensors over time. Ignoring either dimension can lead to a suboptimal understanding of the component's health state and degradation trajectory. Therefore, methods capable of simultaneously modeling these coupled relationships are crucial for accurate predictive maintenance [4,5,12]. The sheer volume and complexity of data from hundreds of sensors, such as the 600 sensors generating extensive data per flight hour on a C-130J aircraft, underscore the need for sophisticated feature extraction techniques [5].​  

Various approaches have been explored for extracting these features. For spatial feature extraction, especially in cases where sensor layouts are irregular or represent complex interdependencies, methods like Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are particularly suitable [4]. GATs can model non-Euclidean spatial relationships by constructing a graph where nodes represent sensors. Relationships between nodes can be determined using similarity measures, such as cosine similarity, which quantify the correlation or dependency between sensor readings [4].  

Attention mechanisms play a significant role in enhancing both spatial and temporal feature extraction by allowing models to focus on the most relevant information. In spatial feature extraction using GATs, attention mechanisms are employed to assign different weights to neighboring sensor nodes, reflecting their varying importance or influence on a given sensor [4]. Similarly, within temporal processing models like the Transformer, multi-head attention mechanisms enable the model to weigh different time steps or feature dimensions based on their relevance to the prediction task [4].  

To capture the intricate interplay between spatial and temporal dynamics, integrated models are necessary. An effective strategy involves combining spatial and temporal feature extractors. For instance, a Graph Attention Network (GAT) can be integrated into the temporal multi-attention module of a Transformer model [4]. This integration allows for the joint extraction of spatiotemporal relationships, where the GAT processes the spatial dependencies at each time step, and the Transformer subsequently models the temporal evolution of these spatially-aware features [4]. Prior preprocessing steps, such as using a Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) to reduce noise and extract initial deep features, can further improve the quality of input data for these models [4].  

While studies demonstrate the application of different models for capturing temporal dependencies, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [12], or employing integrated spatio-temporal approaches like the GAT-enhanced Transformer [4], a direct comparative analysis of the performance metrics across these diverse feature extraction methodologies, based solely on the currently available digests, is not feasible within this scope. The effectiveness of each method is contingent on the specific dataset characteristics, component type, and the complexity of the degradation process being modeled.​  

# 7.2.2 Uncertainty Quantification in RUL Prediction  

Accurate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is paramount for effective predictive maintenance of aircraft components. While point estimates of RUL provide a nominal time frame, they fail to capture the inherent uncertainties arising from varying operational conditions, manufacturing tolerances, and complex degradation mechanisms [4]. Articulating this uncertainty is crucial for enabling robust and risk-aware decision-making in aviation maintenance.​  

The importance of quantifying uncertainty lies in transforming RUL predictions from deterministic forecasts into probabilistic outcomes. Probabilistic predictions—often expressed as a distribution over possible RUL values—offer significant benefits [4]. They allow maintenance planners to understand the likelihood of failure occurring within a specific period, facilitating the scheduling of maintenance tasks based on defined risk tolerance levels rather than single, potentially misleading, point estimates. This approach enables more reliable operations and optimizes maintenance costs by avoiding premature interventions while mitigating the risk of unexpected failures.​  

Bayesian methods represent a powerful paradigm for uncertainty quantification in RUL prediction [4]. Specifically, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have been employed to quantify the uncertainty associated with RUL forecasts by modeling a distribution over the network's weights rather than learning fixed values [4]. This approach allows the model to output a probability distribution for RUL, reflecting the model's confidence in its prediction. For instance, one study utilized a BNN— employing Gaussian mixture distributions as priors for the network weights—to provide a richer representational capacity compared to simpler single Gaussian priors [4]. Variational inference was applied to approximate the intractable true posterior distribution of the weights, with the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence used to assess the similarity between the assumed variational posterior and the true posterior probability [4]. This framework explicitly models both aleatoric (inherent noise) and epistemic (model uncertainty) uncertainties.​  

Comparing different approaches to handling RUL uncertainty reveals varying impacts on reliability strategies. Explicitly quantifying uncertainty through probabilistic models like BNNs allows for sophisticated, risk-based maintenance scheduling tailored to the specific probability distribution of RUL [4]. This contrasts with simpler methods that might address  

uncertainty implicitly—such as applying a fixed safety factor to a point prediction when scheduling maintenance [12]. While using a safety factor provides a buffer against prediction errors [12], it does not fully leverage the detailed uncertainty information available from a probabilistic model. Explicit quantification enables more granular control over risk, potentially leading to maintenance schedules that balance safety and operational cost more effectively than methods relying solely on safety margins applied to point estimates. The ability to analyze the entire probability distribution enhances reliability planning by providing a clearer picture of potential failure scenarios and their likelihoods.​  

# 7.3 Fault Diagnosis  

Machine learning plays a critical role in the field of aircraft fault diagnosis, enabling the identification and classification of anomalies based on various data sources, including sensor readings and maintenance logs. This section reviews key machine learning approaches applied to this domain, examines methods for enhancing the performance of specific algorithms, and explores how these diagnostic systems are integrated into broader predictive maintenance strategies. A central challenge in applying machine learning to aircraft fault diagnosis, particularly for real‐time applications, is balancing model complexity with the need for rapid and accurate predictions.​  

Specific efforts have focused on improving the efficiency and performance of algorithms like Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) [15]. Standard ELM formulations often require a large number of hidden nodes to achieve desired classification accuracy, which can impede real‐time performance in time‐sensitive scenarios such as flight operations [15]. To address this limitation, researchers have developed enhanced ELM variants that reduce the reliance on a large hidden layer while maintaining or improving classification capabilities. Techniques involve modifying the core training equalities through the introduction of slack variables and ​ϵ -draggings [15]. These methods aim to increase the separability between classes by adjusting label vectors, drawing conceptual parallels to the structural risk minimization principles found in Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [15]. Algorithms such as ​ϵ -Dragging Regularized ELM (D-RELM) and Improved D-RELM (ID-RELM) have been proposed, demonstrating enhanced performance and the ability to achieve effective fault classification with fewer hidden nodes, thereby improving real-time operational viability [15]. ID-RELM, in particular, offers greater flexibility and typically outperforms D-RELM by adopting a more dynamic constraint structure than fixed $\pm 1$ reference points [15].  

Furthermore, aircraft fault diagnosis systems are increasingly integrated into comprehensive predictive maintenance frameworks. These frameworks leverage machine learning alongside technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and data from various sources, including customer feedback, engineering insights, and vendor information, to build rich repositories of maintenance history [5]. By learning from collective data, these systems aim to identify patterns indicative of potential future failures and recommend real-time best practices for maintenance [5]. Beyond sensor data, the analysis of unstructured textual data, such as freehand notes and logged discrepancies, using natural language processing (NLP) techniques contributes significantly to fault diagnosis and predictive maintenance [2]. Applications utilizing NLP can cluster similar issues, proactively manage recurring problems ("repeaters"), mitigate errors in fault code logging, and optimize the overall maintenance and repair processes [2].​  

Current research explores the application of various ML algorithms for fault diagnosis and prediction. While specific enhancements like retargeted ELM show promise for real-time classification, the field requires continued comparison of different algorithmic approaches and investigation into methods for effectively integrating diverse data types (sensor, text, historical maintenance records) to develop robust and comprehensive diagnosis and predictive maintenance systems.  

# 7.3.1 Enhancing ELM Performance  

Improving the real-time performance of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) is a critical area for their application in timesensitive domains. One approach to enhance ELM efficiency focuses on optimizing the training process to reduce model complexity while maintaining accuracy [15]. Algorithms have been designed to achieve this by retargeting label vectors and modifying the core equalities within the ELM training phase [15]. The fundamental concept involves mitigating the constraint of strictly defined margins between positive and negative classes—a limitation of standard ELM formulations [15].  

This mitigation is accomplished through the introduction of slack variables and ​ϵ -draggings [15]. These techniques are employed to effectively enlarge the distance between data points belonging to different classes, conceptually aligning with the structural risk minimization principle that underlies Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [15]. By enhancing class separability during training, the goal is to enable effective classification with a reduced number of hidden nodes, thereby addressing the inherent trade-off between model size (and thus computational cost) and predictive accuracy [15].  

Two specific algorithms proposed based on this principle are ​ϵ -Dragging Regularized ELM (D-RELM) and Improved D-RELM (ID-RELM) [15]. D-RELM modifies target values by “dragging” positive class data along a positive direction from an initial reference of $+ 1$ and negative class data along a negative direction from -1 [15]. ID-RELM refines this approach by removing the fixed $\pm 1$ reference points, instead adopting an alternate constraint structure that offers greater flexibility and generally demonstrates superior performance compared to D-RELM [15]. The emphasis on reducing the required number of hidden nodes directly contributes to improving ELM’s real-time operational capability [15]. Such enhancements in computational efficiency and speed are particularly valuable for time-sensitive scenarios, including critical applications like real-time fault diagnosis, where rapid and accurate decision-making is paramount.​  

# 7.4 Case Studies and Applications  

Machine learning techniques have demonstrated significant potential when applied to real‐world aircraft performance monitoring and maintenance. Case studies highlight tangible benefits compared to traditional maintenance approaches. For instance, a project involving Lockheed Martin tracked 20 aircraft and 50 parts over a three‐month period [5]. By implementing predictive maintenance models, this initiative resulted in a saving of 1,400 hours of customer downtime [5]. This clearly illustrates the economic advantages and enhanced operational readiness achievable through intelligent diagnostics [5].  

Similarly, an alarm‐based predictive maintenance framework applied to a fleet of 20 aircraft, each equipped with 2 turbofan engines, demonstrated notable cost efficiency [12]. Under this framework, costs attributed to engine failures constituted only $7 . 4 \%$ of the total maintenance expenditures [12], indicating a substantial reduction in unscheduled and costly repairs compared to traditional methods.​  

Beyond specific cost savings, these predictive approaches—such as those leveraging Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) data analytics in services like FlightSense [2]—offer full life‐cycle support aimed at preventing Aircraft On Ground (AOG) situations and enabling more comprehensive reliability fixes [2]. This proactive stance contrasts sharply with reactive maintenance, which addresses issues only after failure, or scheduled maintenance, which may lead to unnecessary part replacements. The ability to predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) with accuracy and provide confidence intervals, as demonstrated by models validated on datasets like NASA CMAPSS [4], provides a more reliable basis for optimizing maintenance scheduling and decision‐making processes [4]. Furthermore, algorithms applied to aircraft engine fault diagnosis show promise as candidate techniques for identifying issues before they lead to failure [15].​  

While the presented case studies underscore the benefits, successful deployment of these advanced ML‐based systems in aviation faces inherent challenges. Specific difficulties are not elaborated in these particular digests; however, common hurdles in implementing such technologies include ensuring high data quality, overcoming complexities in system integration and deployment within existing operational frameworks, and the necessity for specialized expertise to develop, validate, and maintain the models. The reported successes highlight the potential of these approaches, though their effectiveness is contingent upon the ability to address these underlying technical and logistical challenges.  

# 8. Machine Learning for Flight Control and Navigation  

The integration of machine learning (ML) algorithms into aircraft systems is fundamentally transforming flight control and navigation capabilities, aiming to enhance stability, handling qualities, and fuel efficiency [23]. This progress spans various domains, from sophisticated control law design to enabling advanced autonomous functions.  

A crucial prerequisite for developing effective ML-based control systems, particularly those relying on data-driven or simulation-intensive methods, involves accurately modeling the complex and often nonlinear dynamics of aircraft— including challenging phenomena like aerodynamic hysteresis under unsteady flow conditions [23]. Approaches leveraging concepts such as aerodynamic hysteresis dynamic derivatives and utilizing dimensionless quantities to characterize flow separation are being explored to develop nonlinear, unsteady aerodynamic equations, enabling precise parameter identification [23].​

A prominent ML paradigm in this field is Reinforcement Learning (RL), particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), which is being applied for adaptive flight control [7,23,32]. DRL allows controllers to learn optimal policies directly from interactions, demonstrating potential for developing intelligent controllers for six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) fixed-wing aircraft control, aiming for stable cruise flight and sideslip elimination [7]. Furthermore, DRL, sometimes enhanced by techniques like imitation learning, is being utilized in the development of advanced guidance laws, such as those required for intercepting maneuvering targets [32]. While specific comparisons of diverse ML algorithms for flight control tasks are evolving, DRL algorithms like Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) are frequently investigated due to their suitability for continuous control problems inherent in flight dynamics [7,32]. A key advantage of these ML-based systems, particularly DRL, is their potential for adaptability to changing flight conditions or unforeseen external disturbances, promising enhanced robustness compared to traditional control methods [7,32].  

Beyond control, ML significantly contributes to enhancing navigation accuracy and enabling comprehensive autonomous flight capabilities [23]. This includes optimizing flight paths, such as considering wind forecast uncertainties [25], and supporting critical autonomous functions like path planning, obstacle avoidance, and sophisticated decision-making processes [23]. AI is increasingly applied in autopilot systems and across unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to increase intelligence and expand operational envelopes [23,26]. Basic navigation often leverages algorithms like Dijkstra or ${ \mathsf { A } } ^ { \star }$ , which can be integrated within AI frameworks [26]. Enabling technologies, such as precise angular accelerometers, are also crucial for realizing highly maneuverable autonomous platforms [23].​  

Despite the considerable progress, the deployment of ML-based systems in safety-critical aerospace applications faces significant challenges [7,23,32]. Paramount concerns include the need for formal verification of learned policies to ensure safety and reliability across all operational scenarios, including those not encountered during training [7,32]. Challenges such as certification processes for AI-driven systems, ensuring explainability of complex model decisions, and managing the impact of data quality remain critical areas requiring focused research and development [23]. Furthermore, research into human-in-the-loop control systems, incorporating human intelligent decision-making and cooperative control, is recognized as crucial for the safe and effective integration of AI into flight operations [23].​  

# 8.1 Nonlinear Dynamics Modeling and Parameter Identification  

Modeling the nonlinear dynamics and hysteresis effects in aircraft aerodynamics is crucial for accurate simulation and control, particularly under unsteady flow conditions where flow separation occurs. Addressing this challenge, one approach leverages innovative concepts such as aerodynamic hysteresis dynamic derivatives and develops nonlinear, unsteady aerodynamic equations using dimensionless quantities [23]. These dimensionless quantities are specifically employed to characterize crucial elements like flow separation locations, enabling the model to accurately describe both dynamic and static hysteresis effects [23]. Furthermore, the developed equations demonstrate the capability to predict static aerodynamic hysteresis based solely on dynamic test data [23]. For the subsequent aerodynamic parameter identification, a stepwise identification method utilizing state partitioning is proposed [23]. Experimental validation of this modeling approach has been conducted using both wind tunnel and flight test data to assess its accuracy in capturing aerodynamic hysteresis characteristics [23]. The results indicate a high degree of modeling accuracy, reaching $9 9 \%$ when validated  

against wind tunnel test data and maintaining a robust $9 5 \%$ accuracy based on flight test data [23]. While this work demonstrates a promising method for modeling complex nonlinear dynamics and hysteresis with high fidelity, the provided material does not detail potential applications of this specific modeling approach in improving aircraft maneuverability or safety, nor does it critically assess recommendations for future research directions in this area.​  

# 8.2 Autonomous Flight and UAV Control  

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into advanced aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represents a significant advancement, promising to enhance their intelligence levels and expand their operational capabilities and application spaces [23,26]. This application spans various facets of autonomous flight, including advanced control, navigation, and mission planning.​  

Specific implementations showcase the potential of AI techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (DRL), in achieving sophisticated autonomous behaviors. For instance, DRL has been applied to develop intelligent controllers for fixed-wing aircraft, demonstrating the ability to maintain stable cruise flight with near-zero sideslip, indicative of a high degree of autonomous control [7]. Beyond basic flight control, AI is also being explored for more complex autonomous tasks, such as addressing the large-scale dynamic logistics UAV routing problem through DRL frameworks [27]. This highlights the utility of AI in optimizing complex decision-making processes required for autonomous operations. The application space for AI in UAVs is explicitly recognized as a key area of research focus, particularly concerning control and navigation challenges [30].  

Furthermore, the broader scope of onboard autonomy technologies, including autonomous navigation, fault diagnosis, and system reconfiguration, is a relevant area for applying AI, as seen in the context of spacecraft autonomy [23]. Enabling technologies, such as the Liquid Circular Angular Accelerometer (LCAA), which offers precise measurement for attitude resolution and motion control, are crucial for the development of highly maneuverable autonomous aircraft [23].  

However, the development and implementation of such autonomous systems present notable challenges [23]. Addressing these challenges is critical for realizing the full potential of AI in this domain. The successful integration and deployment of AI-driven autonomous systems are expected to have a profound impact on the future of aerospace technology and hold significant implications for national aerospace safety [23].​  

# 8.3 Deep Reinforcement Learning for Flight Control  

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach for developing advanced aircraft flight control systems and guidance laws [7,32]. This paradigm allows autonomous agents to learn optimal control policies directly from interaction with dynamic environments, typically high-fidelity simulations.  

Applications of DRL in this domain span various critical tasks. One application involves the development of an end-to-end integrated intelligent controller capable of handling the six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) flight dynamics of full-size fixedwing aircraft [7]. This controller aims to achieve objectives such as maintaining stable cruise flight and actively eliminating sideslip [7]. Another significant application is in the development of guidance laws, specifically for trajectory tracking to intercept maneuvering targets [32].  

Analyzing the effectiveness of different DRL algorithms for these flight control tasks, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is frequently considered, particularly for problems involving continuous state and action spaces [7,32]. In the context of 6-DOF flight control, the state space typically encompasses the aircraft's flight state, while the action space corresponds to rudder surface deflections and thrust control inputs [7]. The reward function is meticulously designed to encourage stable flight and minimize undesirable conditions like sideslip [7]. Training for such controllers is often conducted within realistic 6-DOF simulation environments [7]. For the missile guidance task, the state space includes the states of both the missile and the maneuvering target (e.g., position, velocity), and the action space comprises the missile's control commands [32]. The design of the reward function in this case focuses on achieving successful target interception while concurrently minimizing the control effort expended by the missile [32].​  

Despite the potential, the application of DRL in safety-critical domains like aerospace presents significant challenges [7,32]. Concerns regarding formal verification of the learned policies are paramount, as unexpected or unsafe behaviors could have catastrophic consequences. The risk of encountering scenarios not covered during training, leading to unpredictable actions, remains a key challenge that requires robust validation and verification procedures [7,32].  

Nevertheless, DRL offers compelling potential benefits for aircraft control systems. These include the ability to learn complex, non-linear control strategies directly from data or simulation, potentially leading to improved adaptability to varying flight conditions and enhanced robustness against external disturbances or target maneuvers [7,32]. The datadriven nature of DRL allows controllers to potentially generalize better to unforeseen situations compared to traditional control methods, provided training is sufficiently comprehensive.  

# 9. Machine Learning for Enhancing Aviation Safety  

Aviation safety stands as the paramount priority within the aerospace industry, and artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally transforming traditional approaches to ensuring it [21]. AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) techniques offer significant advantages over conventional methods, primarily through advanced data analysis, pattern recognition, prediction modeling, and automated decision-making capabilities [21]. These capabilities enable computer systems to uncover intricate patterns within vast datasets, leading to improved decision-making processes and increased operational efficiency across various domains of aviation safety [21].  

The application of ML in aviation safety encompasses a broad spectrum of techniques, including mathematical and statistical modeling, various AI and ML algorithms, technological innovations, and specialized methods for aviation safety data analysis [21]. Research in this area is often categorized by application, focusing on areas such as accident analysis, pilot behavior monitoring, and the implementation of proactive safety measures [21]. Core functionalities leveraged by ML include predictive analytics, real-time monitoring, and proactive risk management.  

Predictive analytics plays a crucial role in enhancing safety by forecasting potential issues before they lead to incidents. A significant application is predictive maintenance, which aims to reduce the risk of failures, particularly for critical components like aircraft engines [12]. Studies demonstrate that improving the reliability of remaining useful life (RUL) prediction for aero-engines using AI/ML techniques allows for timely maintenance interventions, thereby preventing potential flight accidents [4]. Specific techniques employed for RUL prediction include Graph Attention Networks, Transformer networks, and Bayesian Neural Networks [4]. Furthermore, predictive analytics contributes to safety through applications like the fast and accurate prediction of aerodynamic heating, which is vital for improving the design of thermal protection systems in advanced aircraft such as hypersonic vehicles [6].​  

Beyond maintenance, ML-driven predictive and proactive capabilities are integrated into broader safety management frameworks. Platforms are being developed that convert operational data into actionable intelligence, enabling predictive and proactive safety decisions for entire fleets [2]. Machine learning is explicitly utilized within Performance Based Oversight (PBO) and Safety Management Systems (SMS) frameworks, guided by regulations from bodies like EASA, to monitor and predict safety indicators. Examples include identifying risks associated with Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) and diversion scenarios [31].​  

Real-time monitoring and control systems also benefit from ML techniques to enhance safety. For instance, the use of disturbance observers has been explored to improve the robustness and safety of low-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight control systems when subjected to external disturbances [23]. Other applications mentioned include intelligent temporal detection and obstacle detection, further illustrating the breadth of ML's impact on various aspects of flight and safety [21]. Through these diverse applications, ML facilitates a shift from reactive safety responses to proactive risk identification and mitigation.​  

# 10. ML and Mixed Reality for Enhanced Aviation Experience  

The integration of machine learning (ML) and mixed reality (MR) is significantly impacting the aviation industry, driving advancements towards "smart aviation" concepts. This convergence aims to improve various facets of the sector, notably boosting operator productivity and enhancing the overall passenger experience [17]. The state-of-the-art applications span across critical areas such as aerospace engineering design, manufacturing, testing, and operational services [17].​  

In terms of improving operator productivity, ML and MR technologies are being applied to streamline complex processes within smart aerospace engineering. This includes augmenting design workflows, optimizing manufacturing operations, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of testing procedures, and improving the delivery of aviation services [17]. Furthermore, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) technology to analyze massive and fragmented user-generated content (UGC) data offers a powerful mechanism for deriving deep insights, which can serve as a robust basis for data-driven smart decision-making in services and operations [23].​  

For enhancing passenger experience, smart aviation initiatives utilize autonomous systems, sophisticated self-service options, and advanced data visualization techniques [17]. These applications aim to provide passengers with more control, personalized interactions, and a smoother travel journey from booking to arrival.  

Despite the potential benefits, the transition to smart aviation faces numerous challenges. These include ensuring safety and security, addressing environmental impacts, overcoming technological hurdles, managing implementation costs, expanding capacity, and navigating complex regulatory landscapes [17]. Research explores potential solutions to mitigate these challenges and facilitate the successful adoption of ML and MR in the aviation sector [17].  

# 11. Challenges and Future Directions  

Despite the significant potential of machine learning (ML) in transforming aircraft performance analysis and optimization, its widespread adoption is currently hindered by several key challenges inherent to the aerospace domain [19]. Addressing these challenges is critical for transitioning ML from research settings to certified, operational systems.  

![](images/1e6bcd01fc75606f433ba1cec7795e6b5e73b794bad371536c675800ef526c21.jpg)  

A primary obstacle is the scarcity and complexity of high-quality, diverse datasets required for training robust ML models [6,8,9,23]. Real-world flight data is expensive to acquire and often subject to limitations, while alternative sources like usergenerated content present heterogeneity and variability [23]. Strategies to overcome data scarcity include the generation of synthetic data through methods like Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations [1,6,8] or virtual learning environments (VLEs) [9], as well as leveraging transfer learning from related domains [6]. However, ensuring the fidelity and generalizability of synthetic data remains an active research area [23]. The management and utilization of large, complex aerospace datasets themselves present challenges [5,19].​  

![](images/d155838430d388338763e9cbb1d1be3d891dfc73be3ce97b9350a8c44d3e676b.jpg)  

Another critical challenge concerns the real-time implementation and computational cost of ML models [6,8,33]. Aircraft systems demand rapid response times and low latency, which can be difficult to achieve with computationally intensive models, particularly in resource-constrained airborne environments [33]. Solutions being explored include the development of more efficient algorithms and model architectures, model compression techniques, hardware acceleration, and the optimization of existing methods like Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) [8,9,15]. A persistent trade-off exists between model accuracy and computational feasibility, necessitating careful optimization [6].​  

![](images/3d51cb49a31020168347ac409fbb788ab24ddf09efda7ce31d2eab1694f7afda.jpg)  

The inherently safety-critical nature of aviation poses significant challenges for the certification and validation of ML-based systems [17,19]. Regulatory bodies require certifiable and verifiable models that demonstrate robustness, generalization capability, and predictable behavior under diverse conditions [10,19,23]. Ensuring safety may involve incorporating safety factors into prognostics and maintenance scheduling [12]. The lack of established comprehensive regulatory frameworks specifically for ML in aviation, coupled with challenges in formally verifying the behavior of complex models, represents a major hurdle.  

Furthermore, the “black-box” nature of many powerful ML models, particularly deep neural networks, presents difficulties for interpretation and trust [1,19,20]. For safety-critical decisions, understanding whya model makes a particular prediction is crucial for human oversight, validation, and debugging [20].  

![](images/e606ae2f211b8275614732734ce09d2ed4a88a9b77af9ae2a3715eb67e2a6531.jpg)  

The quantification of uncertainty in model predictions is also vital for risk assessment and reliable decision-making, especially in tasks like Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction or handling uncertain inputs such as weather forecasts [1,4,25]. Developing effective Explainable AI (XAI) techniques and robust Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods, including Bayesian approaches, is therefore paramount [1,4,19,20].

Looking ahead, promising future research directions aim to address these limitations and expand the application scope of ML in aircraft performance. These include the development of physics-informed ML models that integrate prior physical knowledge to enhance data efficiency, generalization, and interpretability [1,4,6,14,20]. Further advancements in XAI techniques are needed to make complex models more transparent [1,19,20]. Research will also focus on better integrating ML approaches with traditional engineering methods [7] and on developing theoretical frameworks for quantifying model capabilities [23], as well as tailoring ML for emerging aircraft technologies like electric [22] and autonomous aircraft [7,23]. Ethical considerations, such as ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability in ML-driven systems, are crucial in safety-critical aerospace applications. Emerging trends like federated learning, digital twins, and blockchain integration hold potential for addressing data distribution, real-time performance simulation, and data trust in complex aerospace ecosystems [19,23]. Research also needs to address specific challenges in areas like unsteady dynamics for novel aircraft configurations [23] and improving robustness to unforeseen conditions [25].  

# 11.1 Data Scarcity and Augmentation  

A significant challenge in applying machine learning to aircraft performance analysis is the inherent scarcity of high-quality, diverse datasets. Real-world flight data acquisition is often constrained by cost, operational limitations, and safety regulations. Furthermore, complex data sources such as user-generated content (UGC) exhibit individual variability, multidirectional dissemination, multi-source heterogeneity, and multi-modal coexistence, making their collection, analysis, and application difficult for training robust models [23]. This data scarcity necessitates the use of data augmentation techniques to expand the available training data, improve model generalization, and enhance accuracy.  

Various data augmentation strategies have been explored to address these limitations. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are a common approach for generating training datasets in aerodynamic applications [6,8]. Utilizing CFD simulations allows for the creation of large volumes of synthetic data under controlled conditions, thereby addressing data scarcity to some extent [6].  

Beyond direct simulation, other synthetic data generation methods are also employed. For aero-engine control, virtual learning environment (VLE) technology—built upon real test data and leveraging the strong nonlinear fitting ability of deep neural networks—has been proposed to overcome challenges associated with direct interaction with real engines [9]. This approach generates synthetic interaction data within a simulated environment. In fluid dynamics, data augmentation can also be achieved by utilizing intermediate mean fields derived from iterative computation procedures [1].​  

While CFD simulations provide a valuable source of synthetic data, their effectiveness in fully capturing complex real-world phenomena can be limited. Exploring alternative data augmentation techniques, such as broader synthetic data generation strategies or transfer learning from related aerodynamic problems, is suggested to further improve model performance and generalization ability [6]. Transfer learning, in particular, offers the potential to leverage knowledge gained from large datasets in related domains to improve performance on smaller, target datasets in aircraft performance.  

Despite the importance and variety of data augmentation techniques, limitations persist. The fidelity of simulationgenerated data to real-world conditions is paramount; inaccuracies in the simulation can introduce biases into the training data. Similarly, the complexity and heterogeneity of real-world data sources [23] pose challenges for creating synthetic data generation models that accurately reflect the full range of variability. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated and validated synthetic data generation methods that can better replicate the nuances of real-world aircraft performance data. Further investigation into effective transfer learning strategies tailored to the specific characteristics of aircraft performance tasks is also a promising avenue for research [6].​  

# 11.2 Real-Time Implementation and Computational Cost  

The integration of machine learning models into aircraft performance applications necessitates efficient real-time implementation. Critical tasks such as flight control, engine management, aerodynamic prediction, and structural health monitoring require rapid response times and low latency, making the computational cost of deployed models a significant concern. High computational demands can impede the practical application of sophisticated models, particularly in resource-constrained airborne environments.  

Addressing the computational cost is crucial for enabling real-time capability. Various strategies are being explored to mitigate these challenges. One approach focuses on developing or adapting more efficient algorithms and model architectures. For instance, the continuous innovation in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms is leading to increased learning efficiency, with some algorithms demonstrating notable advantages in this regard [9]. Similarly, methods have been proposed to reduce the number of hidden nodes in Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), directly addressing their computational cost and improving real-time performance [15]. In the domain of fluid dynamics simulation, models like “东 方·御风”, built on Ascend AI, have achieved substantial speedups (e.g., $2 4 x ^ { \cdot }$ ) compared to traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, highlighting the potential for real-time fluid simulation applications in aircraft design and analysis [8]. While the D-ANN approach in Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) shows improved predictive accuracy over methods like ADM and VGM for sub-filter stress and heat flux [1], its computational implications relative to these baselines in a realtime context are not explicitly detailed in the provided digest.  

Beyond algorithmic efficiency, techniques like model compression and hardware acceleration are recognized as essential for enabling real-time deployment. For example, while a CNN-based method for aerodynamic heating prediction demonstrates computational efficiency compared to traditional CFD, its real-time implementation in aircraft design workflows is contingent on further optimization, specifically mentioning the exploration of model compression techniques or hardware acceleration [6]. This indicates that achieving true real-time performance often requires leveraging specialized hardware or reducing model complexity post-training.  

A fundamental challenge lies in navigating the trade-off between model accuracy and computational cost. More complex models may offer higher predictive accuracy but typically incur greater computational expense, hindering real-time operation. Conversely, simplified models or those optimized for speed might compromise accuracy. The need to apply techniques like ELM node reduction [15] or optimize CNN architectures [6] suggests that achieving the desired balance is an active area of research. The specific impact of these optimizations on prediction accuracy requires careful evaluation, as a significant reduction in accuracy would negate the benefits of real-time capability.  

Current limitations include the inherent computational demands of state-of-the-art complex models and the need for significant effort to optimize them for deployment environments. While promising speedups are demonstrated [8], widespread real-time application across diverse aircraft systems requires further progress. Future research should continue to explore novel efficient algorithms, advance model compression techniques tailored for aerospace data and tasks, and leverage domain-specific hardware acceleration platforms. Investigating methodologies for quantifying and managing the accuracy-cost trade-off systematically for various machine learning models in different aircraft performance contexts remains a critical avenue for future work.  

# 11.3 Safety and Certification  

The application of machine learning models in aircraft performance presents significant challenges related to safety and certification, primarily due to the inherently safety‐critical nature of aerospace engineering [19]. For data‐driven models to be successfully integrated into aircraft systems, they must meet stringent requirements to ensure reliable and safe operation. Key among these requirements is the necessity for models to be certifiable and verifiable [19]. This implies that regulatory bodies and operators must have confidence in the model's behavior and be able to rigorously test and validate its performance under various conditions. Furthermore, models must possess the ability to generalize effectively beyond the specific data they were trained on, ensuring robustness in novel or unseen operational scenarios [19].​  

Beyond technical performance and generalization, the interpretability and explainability of machine learning models are deemed crucial requirements for human oversight and understanding in aerospace applications [19]. This allows engineers and pilots to comprehend the model's decision-making process, which is vital for troubleshooting, trust-building, and ensuring compliance with operational procedures and safety protocols.​  

Specific safety considerations in ML-based performance monitoring or prognostics involve mitigating risks associated with model errors. For instance, in predictive maintenance scheduling based on Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prognostics, safety can be addressed by incorporating a safety factor [12]. This factor provides a buffer against potential inaccuracies in RUL predictions, helping to prevent component failures that could compromise safety [12].  

Meeting the requirements for certifiability, verifiability, generalization, interpretability, and explainability is essential for complying with existing and evolving regulatory standards for aerospace systems. Research in this domain explores various approaches for the verification and validation of machine learning models, including techniques like formal verification, robustness analysis, and fault injection, although the specific regulatory frameworks and detailed methodologies constitute an active area of development. The limited interpretability of complex models like deep neural networks and the difficulty in providing formal guarantees about their behavior under all possible inputs represent significant current limitations. Future research must focus on developing advanced verification and validation techniques, improving model interpretability, and establishing comprehensive regulatory guidelines tailored for ML-based aerospace applications.​  

# 11.4 Uncertainty Quantification and Interpretability  

Reliable decision-making in aircraft performance applications heavily relies on the ability of machine learning models to provide not only predictions but also estimates of their confidence. The quantification of prediction uncertainty is particularly critical for safety-sensitive tasks such as Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction, where imprecise forecasts can have severe consequences [4]. Beyond predicting a single value, understanding the range of possible outcomes and the certainty associated with the prediction is essential for effective risk management and maintenance scheduling. Similarly, uncertainty in inputs, such as wind forecasts, directly impacts the reliability of downstream analyses and decisions in aviation [25].​  

Various approaches have been explored to quantify uncertainty in ML models applied to aircraft performance. For RUL prediction, Bayesian methods offer a principled framework for modeling uncertainty [4]. One study utilized Bayesian methods, specifically employing Gaussian mixture distributions and variational inference, to provide probabilistic RUL forecasts accompanied by confidence intervals, thereby offering a more comprehensive view than point predictions alone [4]. Another method to handle uncertainty in RUL predictions involves incorporating a safety factor, providing a pragmatic measure to account for potential inaccuracies [12]. In the context of fluid dynamics, specifically for statistical inference of closure coefficients in turbulence models, machine learning methods integrated with Bayesian statistics using experimental data have been proposed to quantify the epistemic uncertainty inherent in the closure model itself [1]. These examples illustrate diverse strategies, from probabilistic modeling to heuristic safety margins, tailored to the specific needs and available data for different aspects of aircraft performance.  

Complementary to uncertainty quantification is the challenge of interpreting the decision-making process of complex, often black-box, machine learning models. The lack of transparency in these models poses a significant hurdle to their  

widespread adoption in safety-critical aerospace applications, necessitating the development of explainable AI (XAI) techniques [20]. Trustworthiness is paramount, and understanding whya model makes a particular prediction is crucial for validation, debugging, and gaining user confidence [20].​  

Research in this area investigates different avenues for model interpretability. One approach focuses on analyzing how neural network architectures, such as Euclidean Steerable Convolutional Neural Networks (ESCNN), learn underlying physical principles governing aircraft aerodynamics. By studying the model's internal mechanisms, researchers can assess if it captures fundamental concepts like the Kutta condition [20]. Furthermore, correlating the activation values of internal neurons with physical properties, such as vortex strength distribution, provides insights into which features the model is leveraging for its predictions [20]. Beyond analyzing model internals post-training, certain architectures inherently offer improved interpretability. For instance, Transformer networks, through their self-attention mechanism, explicitly highlight the importance of different input features, offering enhanced geometric interpretability compared to models like CNNs [13].  

# 12. Conclusion  

Machine learning is poised to revolutionize various facets of aircraft performance, building upon the aerospace industry's historical foundation in complex optimization [19]. This survey has highlighted key application areas, including aerodynamic design optimization, performance monitoring, flight control, and maintenance [10,33]. ML techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for aerodynamic heating prediction [6], Diffusion models for multi-objective airfoil design [14], and Transformer networks for flow field prediction [8,13], have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing design efficiency and accuracy. In performance monitoring and maintenance, ML has proven effective for tasks such as engine fault diagnosis using techniques like D-RELM and ID-RELM [15], and enabling predictive maintenance for components and fleets, leading to improved reliability and proactive sustainment strategies [2,5,12]. Furthermore, advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) show promise for developing adaptive and intelligent flight control systems, including potential applications in aero-engine control [7,9,23].​

The potential benefits of integrating machine learning into aircraft performance are substantial. These include enhanced efficiency in design and operation [8,31], reduced environmental impact through optimized flight paths [25], significantly improved safety [21,31] particularly through advanced predictive maintenance [2,4,12], and lower maintenance costs facilitated by predictive capabilities [12]. The transition towards more electric and potentially fully electric aircraft also underscores the need for technological advancements where ML can play a role in performance and efficiency optimization [22].​  

Despite the promising progress, the widespread adoption of machine learning in aircraft performance is accompanied by notable challenges. These include the persistent need for large and high-quality training datasets, ensuring model generalization to unseen conditions [8], addressing uncertainty quantification and model interpretability, and achieving reliable real-time implementation [4]. Safety considerations are paramount, particularly when integrating ML into critical control systems, requiring careful validation and addressing regulatory compliance [9,17].​  

Ongoing research and development efforts are actively addressing these challenges, exploring more advanced models capable of learning physical principles [20] and integrating with other technologies like mixed reality for enhanced applications [17]. The increasing availability of computational power and data is expected to drive further innovation [10]. To fully realize the transformative potential of machine learning in aviation, it is imperative to diligently address the technical hurdles alongside ethical considerations related to autonomy, safety assurance, and data privacy.​  

In conclusion, machine learning is set to profoundly shape the future of aircraft performance and the broader aviation industry, enabling more intelligent design, optimized operations, and enhanced safety. Achieving this future necessitates continued research, robust validation, and critically, strong interdisciplinary collaboration between machine learning researchers, aerospace engineers, and aviation professionals to ensure safe, efficient, and ethical deployment of these powerful technologies.
