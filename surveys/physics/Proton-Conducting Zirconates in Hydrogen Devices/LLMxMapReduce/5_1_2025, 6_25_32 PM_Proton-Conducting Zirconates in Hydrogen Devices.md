# 1. Introduction  

The increasing global energy demand and the urgent need to mitigate climate change necessitate the development of clean and efficient energy technologies [25]. Hydrogen energy systems, including fuel cells and electrolyzers, are crucial components of a sustainable energy future, enabling the conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy and the production of hydrogen from renewable sources [14,21]. Advanced materials, particularly solid-state ion conductors, are central to the performance and viability of these devices [25].  

Traditionally, high-temperature solid oxide cells (SOCs) utilize oxygen-ion conducting electrolytes like yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), requiring operating temperatures typically around $\boldsymbol { 1 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ to achieve sufficient ionic conductivity (e.g., $0 . 1 S c m ^ { - 1 }$ ) [9]. These high temperatures impose stringent requirements on materials, leading to increased fabrication costs, thermal cycling issues, and material degradation [15,18]. Low-temperature alternatives, such as polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells, operate at much lower temperatures but face challenges including the complex synthesis, high cost of membrane materials like Nafion, and narrow operating temperature ranges [8].

Proton-conducting ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) and proton-conducting ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs), operating in the intermediate temperature range (typically $3 0 0 { - } 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ ), offer a compelling balance between performance and material stability, bridging the gap between high-temperature SOCs and low-temperature PEM systems [3,14,21,26,27]. Proton conductors, which facilitate the migration of protonic species like $H ^ { + }$ , $H _ { 3 } O ^ { + }$ , and $N H _ { 4 } ^ { + }$ ions [16], are the core components of these intermediate-temperature devices.​  

Among various candidate materials, acceptor-doped perovskite-type oxides, particularly those based on barium zirconate ( $B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ), have emerged as highly promising ceramic proton conductors [3,5,12,15,16,26,32]. Barium zirconate is a wellstudied ceramic oxide with versatile applications, recognized for its potential as a high-temperature proton conductor when aliovalent cations substitute for zirconium [17].​  

Proton-conducting zirconates offer significant advantages for hydrogen devices operating at intermediate temperatures. They exhibit high proton conductivity and crucially, excellent chemical stability, particularly in atmospheres containing $H _ { 2 } O$ and $C O _ { 2 }$ ​ , where traditional cerate-based electrolytes (e.g., $B a C e O _ { 3 }$ ) are prone to chemical corrosion and electrochemical degradation [3,26,32]. This stability makes zirconates suitable for applications like hydrogen production via water or hydrocarbon electrolysis, natural gas conversion, and ammonia synthesis [3,5,12,26,27]. Furthermore, operating at intermediate temperatures can reduce the thermodynamic constraints on certain reactions, such as ammonia electrosynthesis, and potentially enable the use of less expensive, noble-metal-free catalysts [27].  

Despite their potential, the development and application of proton-conducting zirconates face several significant challenges. A major hurdle is the high sintering temperature required to achieve dense electrolyte films (typically $\geq 1 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ​ -based materials), which leads to high preparation energy consumption, difficulty in processing thin films, and undesirable interface side reactions [3,32]. While zirconates boast superior chemical stability, their intrinsic proton conductivity is often lower than that of cerates, necessitating ongoing research into doping strategies and structural modifications to enhance ionic transport properties [26,32]. Material challenges also include optimizing thermal expansion compatibility with other cell components and improving electrode kinetics, particularly for air electrodes in reversible cells, where conventional materials are unsuitable due to limited proton conductivity and instability under high steam concentrations [12,21].​  

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of proton-conducting zirconates for hydrogen devices. We will explore the fundamental principles governing proton conduction in these materials and analyze recent advances in their synthesis and characterization. The review will then detail their application in various hydrogen technologies, including fuel cells, electrolyzers, and other electrochemical reactors. Key challenges related to material properties, cell fabrication, and long-term stability will be discussed, alongside emerging strategies and future research directions to overcome these limitations. The scope is primarily focused on acceptor-doped barium zirconate perovskites, while briefly acknowledging alternative zirconate structures and related materials where relevant.  

# 2. Fundamentals of Proton Conduction in Zirconates  

Proton conduction in metal oxides, particularly perovskite‐type zirconates, relies on hydrogen acting as a protonic charge carrier. This conductivity arises from the incorporation of water vapor into the oxide lattice, leading to the formation of mobile protonic defects, specifically hydroxyl groups \(OH_{O}^{\bullet}\) residing on oxygen sites [15,16,20,22].  

The fundamental chemical reaction for proton incorporation—or hydration—involves the dissociative absorption of water molecules into pre-existing oxide-ion vacancies \(V_{O}^{\cdot\cdot}\). This process can be represented in Kröger–Vink notation by the equilibrium reaction [15,16]:  

where \(V_{O}^{\cdot\cdot}\) denotes an oxygen vacancy with a double positive effective charge, $\backslash ( 0 \_ \{ 0 \} \wedge \{ x \} \backslash )$ represents a neutral lattice oxygen ion, and $\backslash ( { \mathsf { O H \_ } } \{ { \mathsf { O } } \} \wedge \{ \backslash { \mathsf { c d o t } } \} \backslash )$ signifies a proton (hydrogen ion) associated with a lattice oxygen site, carrying a single positive effective charge relative to the neutral lattice [15,16,20,22]. Alternatively, the reaction can be expressed as  

where \(H_{i}^{\cdot}\) represents an interstitial proton [16]. The concentration of these protonic defects is directly related to the concentration of available oxygen vacancies and the hydration enthalpy, and it is also dependent on the partial pressure of water vapor (\(p_{H_2O}\)) [15,22].​  

The equilibrium constant for the hydration reaction is given by   
\^{2}}{p_{H_2O}},   
\]​  

and this equilibrium shifts to the left (decreasing proton concentration) as temperature increases due to the endothermic nature of the hydration process [15,16].  

Proton transport in these oxide materials primarily occurs via the Grotthuss mechanism [8,16,20,22]. This mechanism involves two key steps: the rotation of the hydroxyl $\left( \backslash \left( \mathsf { O H } \backslash \right) \right)$ bond and the subsequent hopping of the proton from one lattice oxygen ion to an adjacent one [20,22]. This hopping occurs through a hydrogen bond network formed within the hydrated structure [8]. Experimental evidence, such as neutron scattering studies, supports the existence of proton polarons in hydrated metal oxide proton conductors, suggesting that the mobile proton is coupled with local lattice distortions [1].  

The intrinsic crystal structure and induced defect chemistry significantly influence both proton concentration and transport pathways. Oxygen vacancies, essential for the initial hydration step, are typically introduced in zirconates by doping the Zr site with lower-valent cations (e.g., $\vert n \vert ( \sp { \wedge } \{ 3 + \} \backslash )$ substituting for $Z \ r \backslash ( \ r \wedge \{ 4 + \} \backslash ) )$ to maintain charge neutrality [4]. The concentration of these vacancies directly affects the maximum possible proton concentration achievable through hydration [22]. Beyond simply providing hydration sites, doping also induces local distortions in the average cubic perovskite structure. Studies on $\backslash ( \backslash \mathsf { t e x t } \{ \mathsf { B a l n } \} \_ { - } \{ \mathsf { x } \} \backslash \mathsf { t e x t } \{ \mathsf { Z r } \} \_ { - } \{ \mathsf { 1 - x } \} \backslash \mathsf { t e x t } \{ 0 \} \_ \{ -  \{ 3 \ – \backslash \mathsf { f r a c } \{ \mathsf { x } \} \{ 2 \} \} \backslash )$ show that these distortions, driven by the size and charge differences between dopant and host ions, can propagate through the structure beyond a certain dopant threshold (e.g., between $ \lvert x = 0 . 1 0  )$ and $\backslash ( x = 0 . 2 5 \backslash ) \}$ ), and these extended distortions can be favorable for proton transport [4]. Cationic lattice disorder—such as that present in high-entropy oxides or perovskites—creates a distribution in cation– oxygen bond lengths and localized strain. This disorder can influence energy barriers for proton transport, affect the tendency for defect clustering (including proton trapping), and consequently alter ionic conductivity [20,22]. The entropy of migration, related to the number of equivalent proton paths, may also be affected by high configurational entropy in disordered structures, potentially creating a frustrated energy landscape that relaxes constraints on jump trajectories and enhances mobility [22]. Furthermore, the dynamic interaction between protons and the lattice is crucial; proton motion— including hydroxyl rotation and hopping attempts—strongly couples with and can damp certain phonon modes, with the strength of this coupling being dependent on the specific dopant [23].  

Operating conditions such as temperature and partial pressure of water vapor dramatically impact proton conduction. As   
noted, increasing temperature shifts the hydration equilibrium to the left, decreasing proton concentration if sufficient   
water vapor is available [15,16]. However, proton transport itself is a thermally activated process, and proton mobility   
generally increases with temperature following an Arrhenius dependence, described by​   
\  

where $\langle ( \backslash \mathsf { s i g m a \_ } \{ 0 \mathsf { H \_ } \{ 0 \} ^ { \wedge } \{ \backslash \mathsf { b u l l e t } \} \} \backslash )$ is the proton conductivity, \(E_{a}\) is the activation energy, $\left\backslash ( \boldsymbol { \mathsf { k } } \right\backslash )$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $\left. { \left( { \mathsf { T } } \right\backslash } \right)$ is the temperature [15]. The pre-exponential factor \(\sigma_{OH_{O}^{\bullet}}^\*\) is proportional to the product of the proton concentration and the proton mobility (denoted by $\langle ( \mathsf { I m } \mathsf { u \mathrm { \_ } } \{ 0 \mathsf { H \_ } \{ 0 \} ^ { \wedge } \{ \mathsf { U } \mathsf { b u } \mathsf { u } \mathsf { u } \mathsf { t } \} \} \rangle ) \rangle$ [15]. Therefore, the overall proton conductivity is a product of proton concentration (which decreases with increasing temperature at constant \ $( \mathsf { p } _ { - } \{ \mathsf { H } _ { - } 2 \mathsf { O } \} \backslash ) \big .$ and proton mobility (which increases with increasing temperature). This leads to a maximum in proton conductivity at intermediate temperatures. The partial pressure of oxygen can also influence defect chemistry, particularly at high temperatures, by affecting the oxidation state of transition metal dopants, which in turn can alter the concentration of oxygen vacancies and potentially introduce electronic charge carriers (holes) that compete with proton conduction.​  

The activation energy $\left( \backslash ( \mathsf { E _ { - } } \{ \mathsf { a } \} \backslash ) \right)$ for proton conduction is a critical parameter reflecting the energy barriers to proton transport, including the barrier height for hopping, migration entropy, and proton trapping energy [15,22]. Lower activation energies typically indicate faster proton dynamics. Activation energies characteristic of the Grotthuss mechanism are typically below $0 . 4 \ : \mathrm { e V }$ , as seen in various proton conductors [8]. Comparing activation energies across different zirconate systems allows for correlation with variations in structural features, dopant type and concentration, and resultant defect chemistry. Systems with optimized structures that facilitate efficient proton hopping pathways and minimize trapping sites tend to exhibit lower activation energies and consequently higher proton mobility. For instance, the propagation of structural distortions induced by doping in \( \text{BaIn}_{x}\text{Zr}_{1-x}\text{O}_{3-\frac{x}{2}} \) appears favorable for proton transport, implying a possible correlation with reduced energy barriers in the presence of these extended distortions [4].​  

In summary, proton conduction in zirconates fundamentally relies on the hydration of oxygen vacancies to form mobile hydroxyl defects which transport charge via the Grotthuss mechanism. The concentration of these carriers is dictated by oxygen vacancy concentration and operating conditions $( \backslash ( { \mathsf { T } } \backslash ) , \backslash ( { \mathsf { p } } _ { - } \{ { \mathsf { H } } _ { - } 2 { \mathsf { O } } \} \backslash ) )$ , while their mobility is intrinsically linked to the crystal structure, dopant-induced distortions, lattice disorder, and energy barriers $\big ( \backslash ( \mathsf { E \_ } \{ \mathsf { a } \} \backslash ) \big )$ for hopping, rotation, and detrapping.​  

# 3. Material Synthesis and Processing  

The performance of proton‐conducting zirconates in hydrogen devices is intrinsically linked to their material properties, which are dictated by the chosen synthesis and processing routes. Effective material synthesis and processing techniques are paramount for producing high‐quality zirconate powders or films with controlled microstructure, desired phase purity, and ultimately, optimized proton conductivity and long‐term stability [1,18].  

Various synthesis methods are employed to produce proton‐conducting zirconate powders and related materials. The solid‐state reaction method is a widely used approach, involving the high‐temperature treatment of mixed precursor powders [17,20,21,22,25,26,28]. This technique relies on solid‐state diffusion, requiring high temperatures (often exceeding $\boldsymbol { 1 4 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ ) and controlled atmospheres and durations to achieve reaction completeness and desired phases, as demonstrated for materials like  

${ \cal D } y _ { 2 } { \cal Z } r _ { 2 } { \cal O } _ { 7 }$ ​ ( $\mathtt { 1 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } C } )$ [28],  

$B a H f _ { 0 . 8 } Y _ { 0 . 2 } O _ { 3 }$ ​ $\mathtt { 1 0 5 0 ^ { \circ } C } )$ [21], and  

$B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ​ ( $1 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ or 1773 K) [17]. While versatile, a key challenge associated with solid‐state reaction, particularly during subsequent conventional sintering, is achieving high densities without detrimental grain growth or the formation of resistive grain boundary phases [14].  

Wet‐chemical methods, such as sol–gel and coprecipitation, offer alternative routes for synthesizing precursor powders, often providing better homogeneity and finer particle sizes compared to traditional solid‐state mixing [25,27,28,29]. Techniques like gel‐casting have been successfully applied to synthesize yttrium‐doped barium zirconate powders [29], while coprecipitation is used for materials like BCY [27]. These methods allow for precise control over chemical parameters (concentration, pH, temperature), influencing gelation kinetics, particle morphology, and the microstructure of the final powder [29]. A co‐ions complexation method (CCM) has also been explored for pyrochlore lanthanum zirconate synthesis at a relatively lower temperature of $1 3 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ [28], indicating the potential of wet chemistry to reduce processing temperatures for certain phases.​  

The synthesis parameters directly influence the resulting microstructure (grain size, density, porosity) and phase purity of zirconate materials [1,18]. High‐temperature sintering, often necessary for densification after powder synthesis, can lead to excessive grain growth, increasing grain boundary resistance which is a significant factor affecting total proton conductivity in polycrystalline materials. Achieving high density while maintaining a fine‐grained microstructure or controlling grain boundary properties remains a critical challenge in conventional processing.  

To overcome the limitations of conventional sintering and achieve improved material properties, advanced techniques are being explored [3]. Co‐sintering strategies, for example, have demonstrated the ability to achieve high relative densities exceeding $9 5 \%$ for BZY electrolyte layers at temperatures as low as $1 4 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ by leveraging the shrinkage stress from a supporting layer [3,27]. While still involving elevated temperatures, these methods represent progress towards reducing the thermal budget or improving densification efficiency compared to conventional bulk sintering. The potential of other advanced sintering techniques like spark plasma sintering (SPS) or novel low‐temperature synthesis routes is recognized for their capacity to yield dense materials with tailored microstructures, potentially reducing processing costs and enhancing performance [3].  

For miniaturized hydrogen devices, the fabrication of thin or ultra‐thin proton‐conducting zirconate films is essential for minimizing ohmic resistance. A variety of thin‐film deposition methods are utilized, each with distinct advantages and challenges [3]. Vapor deposition techniques include pulsed laser deposition (PLD), known for its ability to control crystal structure and produce dense, grain boundary–free columnar films with low ohmic resistance on a laboratory scale, though its scalability is limited [15,18]. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) offers exceptional conformality and precise thickness control at the nanometer scale, beneficial for optimizing electrode interfaces or depositing highly uniform layers [15,18]. Sputtering is another widely used physical vapor deposition method for depositing electrolytes on various substrates [15,18]. Other  

vapor phase methods like Electron Beam Physical Vapor Deposition (EB-PVD) or Directed Vapor Deposition (EB-DVD) and plasma spraying techniques (APS, SPPS, suspension plasma spraying) are also employed for depositing ceramic coatings, including rare earth zirconates [7,28].​  

Solution-based deposition methods, such as spray coating (including suspension spray coating and electrostatic spray deposition – ESD), spin coating, and vacuum-assisted dip coating, provide more facile and potentially economical alternatives, especially for larger areas [1,14,15,18]. Vacuum-assisted dip coating, for instance, has shown efficacy in producing uniform and thin electrolyte layers [14]. While generally simpler, controlling the density and microstructure (e.g., porosity in spray-coated films) can be more challenging with these methods compared to vacuum techniques [15]. Regardless of the specific deposition technique, precise control over process parameters (temperature, atmosphere, deposition rate, precursor composition) is critical as they directly influence the resulting film's crystal structure, density, defects, strain, and stoichiometry, all of which profoundly impact microstructure and proton conductivity [1,18,24]. The ability of techniques like PLD and ALD to control material properties at the nanoscale is particularly valuable for optimizing ultra-thin electrolyte layers where grain boundary effects are paramount [15,18].​  

In summary, the synthesis and processing of proton‐conducting zirconates involve a spectrum of techniques, from conventional solid‐state reaction for powders to advanced sintering strategies and diverse thin‐film deposition methods. The choice of method and the precise control of parameters are critical for tailoring microstructure and phase purity, which are directly linked to proton transport properties and long‐term device stability. Overcoming challenges in achieving high density, controlling grain growth, and developing cost‐effective, scalable low‐temperature processes and thin‐film techniques remains central to advancing the performance of proton‐conducting zirconates in hydrogen technologies.  

# 3.1 Solid-State Reaction  

The solid-state reaction method is a widely employed technique for synthesizing various ceramic materials used in hydrogen devices, including proton‐conducting zirconates and related compounds [17,21,25,26,28]. This process typically involves mixing precursor powders, such as metal oxides or carbonates, followed by high‐temperature heat treatment to facilitate the diffusion and reaction between components, leading to the formation of the desired crystalline phase [25,26].  

The specific synthesis parameters, including temperature, time, and atmosphere, are critical in determining the outcome of the solid‐state reaction, influencing aspects such as reaction completeness, phase purity, and powder characteristics. Studies demonstrate a range of conditions used depending on the target material. For instance,  

$$
{ \cal D } y _ { 2 } Z r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 }
$$  

with a defective fluorite structure was prepared by heating at $1 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for 10 hours [28]. The synthesis of  

$B a H f _ { 0 . 8 } Y _ { 0 . 2 } O _ { 3 - \delta }$ ‐based air electrode materials  

involved firing at a comparatively lower temperature of $1 0 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for 12 hours to achieve the desired phases [21]. Similarly, $B a Z r O _ { 3 }$  

powder, a common proton conductor base, was annealed at 1773 K (equivalent to $1 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ ) under air for 24 hours [17]. For $B a T i O _ { 3 } \cdot S c _ { 2 } O _ { 3 }$  

compositions (BTS), the solid‐state reaction was used with various final sintering temperatures ranging from $1 4 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for BTS20 to $1 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for BTS50 and BTS70 [26]. Similarly, the synthesis of 8YSZ and Ni‐8YSZ cermets commonly involves high‐ temperature solid‐state reaction, with sintering temperatures for the cermet typically between 1400 and $1 5 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ in static air [25]. These examples highlight the necessity of tailoring temperature and time profiles for different material systems to achieve successful synthesis.​  

The reaction atmosphere and post‐synthesis treatments also play a role. For example, after sintering, BTS samples were subjected to vacuum drying at $5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ under dynamic vacuum  

$$
( 1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } \mathrm { m b a r } )
$$  

for an extended period of 96 hours [26], indicating the importance of controlled environments beyond initial high‐ temperature firing. Additionally, $B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ​ annealing was conducted under air [17], and Ni‐8YSZ cermet sintering in static air [25], demonstrating the use of specific gas environments during high‐temperature processing. While the provided digests detail the parameters used in various synthesis efforts, they primarily report the conditions employed to obtain the materials rather than providing a detailed analysis of how systematic variation of temperature, time, or atmosphere  

specifically influences reaction completeness, phase purity, or particle morphology within a single study. Furthermore, the digests do not elaborate on the inherent limitations of the solid‐state reaction method, particularly concerning challenges related to achieving high densities and controlled microstructures during subsequent sintering steps, which are critical for device performance.​  

# 3.2 Sol-Gel Methods  

Sol-gel methods represent a versatile approach for synthesizing ceramic powders, including materials relevant to hydrogen devices. These techniques involve the formation of a colloidal suspension (sol) that gradually evolves into a gel-like network through processes like hydrolysis and condensation reactions. This method has been applied to synthesize various oxide materials. For instance, $8 \mathrm { m o l } \%$ yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ), a well-known solid electrolyte often compared with proton conductors or used in related devices, can be synthesized using the sol-gel method [25]. Furthermore, related methods such as gel-casting have been employed for the synthesis of yttrium-doped barium zirconate powders, which are prominent proton-conducting materials [29]. While the fundamental sol-gel process involves the transition from liquid precursors to a solid network, the specific chemical parameters, such as precursor concentration, pH, temperature, and aging conditions, significantly influence the gelation kinetics and the final properties of the dried and sintered powder, including particle size, morphology, and microstructure. Subsequent steps like drying are critical as shrinkage and stress development during solvent removal can lead to cracking and density variations, impacting the material's final characteristics relevant for device performance. The precise control over these steps is essential for obtaining high-quality powders suitable for fabricating dense ceramic electrolytes or electrodes.  

# 3.3 Other Synthesis Techniques  

Beyond conventional solid-state reaction and basic sol-gel processes, various alternative wet-chemical methods and deposition techniques have been explored for synthesizing proton‐conducting zirconates and fabricating thin electrolyte layers, often offering specific advantages. Coprecipitation is a widely employed wet‐chemical route for synthesizing oxide materials such as 8YSZ [25], a method known for its potential to yield highly homogeneous precursor powders, which can facilitate lower calcination temperatures or shorter reaction times compared to solid‐state mixing. For complex zirconate phases, such as pyrochlore lanthanum zirconate, a co‐ions complexation method (CCM) has been proposed, enabling synthesis at temperatures around $1 3 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ [28]. While synthesis temperatures for zirconates can vary significantly based on the specific composition and target phase, this method demonstrates the potential for wet chemistry to achieve desired phases at relatively moderate temperatures compared to the typical high‐temperature solid‐state routes often exceeding $1 4 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for dense ceramics.​  

For fabricating thin electrolyte films crucial for reducing ohmic losses in electrochemical devices, several solution‐based deposition techniques offer alternatives to vacuum‐based methods. Spray coating, including suspension spray coating and electrostatic spray deposition (ESD), presents a facile and economical approach compared with vacuum deposition techniques [18]. These methods allow for the deposition of precursor solutions or particle suspensions onto substrates [14]. Spin coating is another solution deposition technique utilized for applying precursor films [14]. Among the evaluated deposition methods—including spray and spin coating—vacuum‐assisted dip coating has demonstrated superiority in producing uniform and thin electrolyte layers [14]. The ability to form dense, homogeneous thin films with controlled thickness is a critical benefit of such solution deposition techniques, directly impacting the performance of proton‐ conducting devices by minimizing resistance and ensuring structural integrity. These alternative techniques thus provide valuable pathways for achieving desired material properties and device architectures with improved efficiency or reduced manufacturing costs.​  

# 3.4 Advanced Sintering and Thin Film Deposition  

Achieving high density and controlling microstructure, particularly grain size and grain boundary properties, are crucial for optimizing the performance of proton‐conducting zirconate electrolytes. Conventional sintering typically involves high temperatures, which can lead to excessive grain growth and detrimental reactions at grain boundaries. Studies have investigated the effects of sintering temperature and time on the microstructure and density of materials like BCZY [14]. Higher sintering temperatures and longer durations have been shown to increase grain size and reduce porosity, ultimately resulting in denser electrolyte layers [14]. Advanced techniques, such as co‐sintering with supporting layers, offer advantages in achieving high density [3,27]. For instance, co‐sintering a BZY electrolyte layer with a BCZY+NiO support  

layer at $1 4 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ resulted in a relative density exceeding $9 5 \%$ [3]. Another study utilized co‐sintering of a BCY electrolyte layer with a NiO‐BZY cermet pellet at $1 4 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ [27]. The linear shrinkage rate is notably influenced by the structure, with a BCZY‐supported three‐layer structure exhibiting a significantly higher shrinkage rate $( \sim 2 1 \% )$ compared to a BZY double layer structure $( \sim 1 5 \% )$ at $1 4 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ , contributing to the higher achieved density [3]. While these examples still employ relatively high temperatures, the co‐sintering approach allows for the simultaneous densification of multiple layers in a single thermal process.​  

For applications requiring thin and ultra‐thin proton‐conducting layers, various thin‐film deposition methods are employed, each offering distinct advantages and characteristics that influence film quality, density, and proton conductivity Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a widely used physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique for fabricating ceramic films on a laboratory scale [15,18]. PLD can produce both nanosized porous and dense films and enables optimization of the crystal structure [18]. Notably, a PLD‐fabricated yttrium‐doped barium zirconate membrane achieved a remarkably low ohmic resistance of $0 . 2 ~ \Omega \cdot \mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ at $4 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ , attributed to its grain boundary‐free columnar structure [15]. However, the limited scalability of PLD poses a challenge for practical implementation [15]. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is another precise technique capable of depositing highly conformal films with atomic layer precision, ranging from atomic layers to nanometer thicknesses [15,18]. This conformality makes ALD particularly effective for improving the durability of nanostructured electrodes, although it requires a smooth, dense substrate or a porous matrix with small pores [15]. Sputtering is employed for depositing electrolytes on various substrates, including silicon wafers, porous anodic aluminum oxide, and ceramic electrodes, and is also used for coating electrodes on thin‐film membranes [15,18]. Other vapor deposition methods, such as electron beam evaporation and directed vapor deposition (EB-DVD), have been explored for depositing ceramic coatings like $S m _ { 2 } Z r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 }$ ​ [7,28]. Plasma spraying, including atmospheric plasma spray (APS), solution precursor plasma spray (SPPS), and suspension plasma spraying, represents another class of techniques used for applying ceramic layers, such as $S m _ { 2 } Z r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 }$ ​ and $L a _ { 2 } Z r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 }$ ​ coatings [7,28]. Solution-based processing methods, such as spin coating, blade coating, and spray coating, also offer versatile routes for fabricating thin films [1].  

Deposition parameters significantly influence the resulting film properties and proton conductivity. For instance, the crystal structure, density, and defects can be manipulated through process control [18]. Factors such as strain [1], substrate orientation [1], and film composition, including the presence of excess elements like barium in $B a _ { 1 + x } Z r _ { 0 . 8 } Y _ { 0 . 2 } O _ { 3 - \delta }$ ​ thin films, impact the microstructure and proton conductivity [24]. The ability of methods like PLD and ALD to achieve precise control over thickness, stoichiometry, and microstructure at the nanoscale is particularly beneficial for optimizing the performance of ultra-thin electrolyte layers, where grain boundary resistance and film density are critical [15,18].  

# 4. Structural and Thermophysical Properties  

The structural and thermophysical properties of proton‐conducting zirconates are fundamental to their performance and durability in high-temperature hydrogen devices. This section systematically examines the crystal structures adopted by these materials, the profound impact of doping on their crystallographic and defect structure, and their critical thermophysical characteristics such as thermal expansion. Understanding these aspects, often through a combination of experimental characterization and theoretical modeling, is essential for rational material design and optimization.​

Proton‐conducting zirconates primarily crystallize in the perovskite $\backslash ( A B O _ { - } 3 \backslash )$ structure, with representative examples like \ (\mathrm{BaZrO_3}\) (\(\mathrm{BZO}\)), which typically maintains a cubic \(Pm\overline{3}m\) structure over a broad temperature range [17].

$( \backslash \mathsf { m a t h r m \{ B a C e \_ } 0 . 2  \mathsf { Z r \_ } \{ 0 . 7 \} \mathsf { Y \_ } \{ 0 . 1 \} \mathsf { O \_ } \{ 3 \cdot  \mathsf { \backslash d e } | \mathsf { t a } \} \} )$ , also exhibit a cubic structure after high-temperature processing [14]. Beyond the ideal cubic form, variations in composition or external conditions can lead to lower symmetry structures or distortions [17,26]. Relevant alternative structures for zirconium oxides include the monoclinic, cubic, and tetragonal phases of \(\mathrm{ZrO_2}\) [7], often stabilized by dopants like \(\mathrm{Y_2O_3}\), \(\mathrm{CaO}\), \   
(\mathrm{MgO}\), and \(\mathrm{Sc_2O_3}\) [7,25]. Rare earth zirconates $\langle \backslash ( \backslash \mathsf { m a t h r m } \{ \mathsf { L n \_ 2 Z r \_ 2 0 \_ 7 } \} \backslash ) \rangle$ represent another class, adopting pyrochlore or fluorite structures characterized by intrinsic oxygen vacancies and cation ordering differences [28]. Other non-perovskite structures such as hexagonal perovskite derivatives and brownmillerite have also been explored [13].​  

Acceptor doping is a pivotal strategy for introducing oxygen vacancies, which are indispensable for proton incorporation and transport [9,16,22,25]. Substituting higher valent cations (e.g., $\langle ( \mathsf { m a t h r m } \{ Z \mathsf { r } ^ { \wedge } \{ 4 + \} \} \backslash ) \rangle$ with lower valent ones (e.g., \ (\mathrm{Y^{3+}}\), \(\mathrm $\{ \mathsf { S c } ^ { \land } \{ 3 + \} \} \backslash )$ , \(\mathrm{In^{3+}}\)) on the B-site of perovskites requires the formation of oxideion vacancies $\langle \rangle | e \mathsf { f t } ( \mathsf { V \_ f } \backslash \{ \mathsf { t e x t } \{ \mathsf { O } \} \} \rangle \land \{ \mathsf { \backslash b u l } | \mathsf { e f } \backslash \mathsf { b u } | | \mathsf { e t } \} \backslash \mathsf { r i g h t } ) \backslash \rangle$ for charge neutrality [16,25]. These vacancies serve as sites for proton uptake under humid atmospheres, forming hydroxyl groups \(\left(OH_{\text{O}}^{\bullet}\right)\) [1,23].  

Beyond vacancy creation, doping significantly alters the crystal structure at both local and long-range scales. The identity, concentration, and substitution site of dopants influence lattice parameters, induce local distortions, and can drive structural phase transitions [4,26]. For example, increasing In concentration in $\langle ( \textsf { m a t h r m \{ B a \vert \mathsf { n } _ { - } \times Z \mathsf { r } _ { - } \{ 1 - \mathsf { x } \} }  0 _ { - } \{ 3 - \mathsf { x } / 2 \} \rangle \backslash )$ induces local distortions observable via IR and Raman spectroscopy due to ionic size and charge mismatch [4]. In \ (\mathrm{BaTi_{1-x}Sc_xO_{3-\delta}}\), increasing Sc content triggers a transition from a 6H hexagonal to a cubic perovskite phase [26]. Yttrium doping in \(\mathrm{BaZrO_3}\) can lead to a tetragonal phase for certain compositions [17]. A-site doping in rare earth zirconates with cations of different radii can also induce lattice distortions [28]. Complex doping strategies, including co-substitution on A and B sites [6] or multi-element doping, can result in multi-phase materials with distinct structural components [21]. These structural modifications, alongside vacancy type and concentration and proton sites, dictate proton transport pathways.  

Experimental techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD) [6,14,17,21], neutron powder diffraction (NPD) [26], IR and Raman spectroscopy [1,4,23], EXAFS, and TEM/HR-STEM [6,21] are critical for characterizing these doping-induced structural changes. Complementary theoretical approaches, including first-principles calculations and quasi-harmonic approximations, are employed to predict crystallographic parameters and thermophysical properties, aiding in the understanding of structure-property relationships [17,28].  

Thermophysical properties, particularly thermal expansion and stability at elevated temperatures, are crucial for device integration and performance. The linear thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) varies with composition and temperature. \ (\mathrm{BaZrO_3}\) exhibits increasing TEC with temperature, reaching an estimated high-temperature value around \   
[17]. In contrast, rare earth zirconates like \(\mathrm{Dy_2Zr_2O_7}\) show higher TECs, approximately   
\​  

at $1 3 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ [28]. The low-temperature thermophysical behavior of \(\mathrm{BaZrO_3}\) aligns with a two-term Debye model, suggesting distinct vibrational characteristics for cations and anions [17]. Thermal stability is paramount, as high temperatures can induce undesirable phase changes and sintering, as seen in 8YSZ above $1 2 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ [7]. Doping, as demonstrated by Yttrium in \(\mathrm{ZrO_2}\) [25], is a common strategy to enhance thermal stability and suppress detrimental phase transitions. A significant challenge for device assembly is the thermal expansion mismatch between zirconate components and interfacing materials, which can lead to mechanical stress and failure [17,28]. Careful material selection and compositional tuning are required to mitigate these issues.​  

In summary, the structural framework of proton‐conducting zirconates, ranging from common perovskites to alternative structures, is intrinsically linked to defect chemistry governed by doping. Doping not only introduces essential oxygen vacancies for proton conduction but also induces complex local and long-range structural modifications and influences phase stability. These structural characteristics, coupled with thermophysical properties like thermal expansion, fundamentally determine material compatibility and performance in hydrogen devices. Continued research integrating advanced experimental techniques and theoretical modeling is vital for precise control over structure and properties, addressing current challenges related to doping effects, phase stability, and thermal expansion matching for robust and efficient device operation.​  

# 4.1 Crystal Structure and Defect Chemistry  

Proton conductivity in zirconate-based materials is intrinsically linked to their crystal structure and the formation of defects, primarily oxygen vacancies, which facilitate the incorporation and transport of protons. Zirconates commonly adopt the perovskite structure ( $A B O _ { 3 }$ ), with $\mathsf { B a Z r O _ { 3 } }$ (​BZO ) serving as a representative example, exhibiting a cubic perovskite structure with space group $P m \overline { { 3 } } m$ over a wide temperature range ( $4 . 2 \mathsf { K }$ to 450 K) [17]. Other compositions, such as BCZY271 $( \mathsf { B a C e } _ { 0 . 2 } \mathsf { Z r } _ { 0 . 7 } \mathsf { Y } _ { 0 . 1 } \mathsf { O } _ { - } \{ 3 \cdot \mathsf { \backslash } \mathsf { d e } | \mathsf { t a } \}$

The pyrochlore structure is characterized by ordered crystalline sites, whereas the fluorite structure exhibits totally disordered cations [28]. Alternative structural types, including hexagonal perovskite derivatives and brownmillerite, have also been explored for their proton-conducting properties [13].  

Acceptor doping is a crucial strategy for introducing oxygen vacancies into the crystal lattice of zirconates. In $A B O _ { 3 }$ ​ perovskites, this typically involves substituting a tetravalent cation on the B-site (like $Z \ r ^ { 4 + }$ ) with a trivalent cation (such as rare earths, $\textsf { Y } ^ { 3 + }$ , $\mathsf { S c } ^ { 3 + }$ , $\mathsf { o r } \mathsf { l n } ^ { 3 + }$ ) [16]. This substitution requires the formation of oxide-ion vacancies $( V _ { 0 } ^ { \bullet \bullet } )$ to maintain charge neutrality [16,25]. For instance, doping $Z \mathsf { r } 0 _ { 2 }$ with yttrium generates oxygen vacancies that facilitate ionic conduction at elevated temperatures [25]. Similarly, acceptor doping is key to creating oxygen vacancies in high-entropy cubic perovskites, with the concentration of vacancies depending on the dopant concentration; for example, in  

$$
B a Z r _ { 0 . 2 } S n _ { 0 . 2 } T i _ { 0 . 2 } H f _ { 0 . 2 } Y _ { 0 . 2 } O _ { 3 - \delta } ,
$$  

approximately one oxygen vacancy forms per two yttrium ions, while an undoped analogue  

$$
B a Z r _ { 0 . 2 } S n _ { 0 . 2 } T i _ { 0 . 2 } H f _ { 0 . 2 } C e _ { 0 . 2 } O _ { 3 - \delta }
$$  

shows negligible vacancy concentration [22]. The formation of oxygen vacancies is essential for enabling proton conductivity [9].  

The presence of oxygen vacancies is paramount as they serve as primary sites for proton incorporation. Upon exposure to water vapor, these vacancies can be filled, leading to the formation of hydroxyl groups ( $O H _ { \mathrm { O } } ^ { \bullet }$ ), where a proton binds to an oxygen ion adjacent to a vacancy [1,23]. The introduction of protons into the lattice, such as in barium zirconate, creates these hydroxyl groups and other defects that influence lattice dynamics [23]. The location of these oxygen vacancies and subsequently incorporated protons can vary depending on the specific crystal structure and hydration state. In dehydrated materials, oxygen vacancies may localize in specific structural polyhedra, like the shared face of $M _ { 2 } O _ { 9 }$ ​ polyhedra in  

hexagonal structures, or exhibit no long-range order in cubic structures [26]. Hydration can induce different proton sites within both hexagonal and cubic structures [26].  

Beyond merely creating vacancies, acceptor doping can also induce local structural changes. For example, introducing In​3 into $Z \ r ^ { 4 + }$ sites in  

$$
B a I n _ { x } Z r _ { 1 - x } O _ { 3 - \frac { x } { 2 } }
$$  

leads to distortions in the $( \mathsf { I n } / \mathsf { Z r } ) \mathsf { O } _ { 6 }$ octahedra due to size and charge mismatch between the ions [4]. While oxygen vacancies are present due to doping, these local structural distortions are primarily driven by the dopant characteristics rather than the vacancies themselves [4]. Such structural modifications, both local and long-range, alongside the type and concentration of oxygen vacancies and the resulting proton sites, significantly impact the pathways and kinetics of proton transport within the material. Co-substitution on both A and B sites, as demonstrated in  

$$
B a F e O _ { 3 - \delta }
$$  

based perovskites like  

$$
B a _ { 0 . 8 7 5 } F e _ { 0 . 8 7 5 } Z r _ { 0 . 1 2 5 } O _ { 3 - \delta } ,
$$  

can be used to fine-tune oxygen vacancy formation and enhance hydroxide ion incorporation [6]. The precise configuration of these defects and the structural environment around the incorporated protons are critical factors determining the efficiency of proton conduction [4,32].  

# 4.2 Effect of Doping on Crystal Structure  

The introduction of dopants profoundly influences the crystal structure and stability of zirconate-based proton conductors, a critical factor governing their properties and performance in hydrogen devices [4,26]. Dopants, typically substituted onto the A or B sites of the perovskite or other zirconate structures, can vary in charge state and ionic radius relative to the host ions. For instance, yttrium $( Y ^ { 3 + } )$ and niobium $[ N b ^ { 5 + }$ ) act as acceptor and donor type constituents, respectively, when substituting on the B-site, commonly occupied by $^ { 4 + }$ ions such as Zr, Ti, Hf, Sn, and Ce [20,22]. Acceptor doping, substituting a lower valent cation for a higher valent one, is a primary method for introducing oxygen vacancies, which are essential for proton uptake and transport via the Grotthuss mechanism.​  

The impact of B-site doping concentration on structural modifications has been systematically investigated. In the case of In doping in $B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ​ $B a I n _ { x } Z r _ { 1 - x } O _ { 3 - x / 2 } \ )$ ), increasing the indium concentration $( x )$ induces significant local distortions away from the average cubic perovskite structure [4]. These distortions are effectively monitored through changes in IR and Raman spectroscopic features, where the appearance and growth in intensity of new bands serve as direct evidence [4]. A critical observation is the existence of a compositional threshold, suggested to lie between $x = 0 . 1 0$ and $x = 0 . 2 5$ , beyond which these local distortions do not merely remain isolated but propagate throughout the entire perovskite framework [4]. Similarly, in the $B a T i _ { 1 - x } S c _ { x } O _ { 3 - \delta }$ ​ (BTSX) system, increasing the Sc concentration $( x )$ drives a structural phase transition from a 6H hexagonal perovskite symmetry to a cubic perovskite phase, highlighting the role of dopant concentration in altering the long-range crystal structure [26].​  

Yttrium doping in $B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ​ also provides detailed insights into concentration-dependent structural changes [29]. Experimental investigations utilizing synchrotron powder diffraction, EXAFS, and Raman spectroscopy on $B a Z r _ { 1 - x } Y _ { x } O _ { 3 - \delta }$ have revealed a transition to a tetragonal structure, indexed in space group $P 4 / m b m$ , for compositions within the range $0 . 0 6 < x < 0 . 1 5$ [17]. This finding underscores that acceptor doping can lead to symmetry lowering transitions from the ideal cubic structure, although the precise space group and details of these transitions, particularly in $B a Z r _ { 1 - x } Y _ { x } O _ { 3 - \delta }$ , have been subject to debate in the literature [17].  

Beyond B-site substitution, A-site doping also plays a significant role in determining the crystal structure, particularly in rare earth zirconates. Substitutions involving elements with different cationic radii on the A-site can induce substantial lattice distortions [28]. For instance, the complete substitution of lanthanum by smaller cations like neodymium, europium, and gadolinium in rare earth zirconates leads to evident structural changes, which are correlated with macroscopic properties such as an increase in thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) [28].  

Furthermore, the complexity of structural modification increases with co-doping and multi-element substitution strategies. Studies exploring simultaneous A-site and B-site co-substitution demonstrate intricate effects on the crystal structure of perovskite oxides [6]. Introducing multiple dopants can even lead to the formation of multi-phase materials. For example, doping Co, Fe, and $\mathsf { P r }$ into the Y-doped $B a H f O _ { 3 - \delta }$ ​ matrix $( B a H f _ { 0 . 8 } Y _ { 0 . 2 } O _ { 3 - \delta } )$ ) results in a composite material exhibiting three distinct phases: Y-doped $B a C o O _ { 3 - \delta }$ , $P r B a C o _ { 2 } O _ { 5 + \delta }$ , and Y-doped $B a H f O _ { 3 - \delta }$ ​ [21]. This highlights how the choice and combination of multiple dopants can dictate not only local and long-range structural changes but also the overall phase assemblage of the material.​  

In summary, the crystal structure and its stability in zirconates are highly sensitive to the dopant's identity (ionic radius, charge state) and concentration. Doping can induce local distortions, drive structural phase transitions, and influence the formation of single or multiple phases. Experimental techniques, including diffraction and spectroscopy, are crucial tools for probing these doping-induced structural modifications, providing the necessary evidence to understand the complex structure–property relationships in these materials.  

# 4.3 Thermal Stability and Expansion  

The thermophysical properties of proton‐conducting zirconates, particularly their thermal expansion and stability, are critical considerations for their application in high‐temperature hydrogen devices such as solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and electrolyzers. Understanding and controlling these properties is essential for ensuring long‐term device performance and durability.​  

Thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) vary significantly among different zirconate compositions and with temperature. For $\mathrm { B a Z r O _ { 3 } }$ ​ (BZO), the linear thermal expansion coefficient (denoted as $\alpha _ { L }$ ​ ) exhibits a temperature dependence, starting near 0 at $4 . 2 \mathsf { K } ,$ increasing monotonically to approximately  

$$
3 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }
$$  

by $1 0 0 \mathsf { K } ,$ and showing an approximately linear increase to  

$$
5 . 4 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }
$$  

at 250 K [17]. Above 250 K, the rate of increase slows, reaching  

$$
6 . 6 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }
$$  

at $5 0 0 \mathsf { K } ,$ with a high‐temperature value estimated to be  

$$
7 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }
$$  

[17].  

n contrast, rare‐earth zirconates like $\mathrm { { D y _ { 2 } Z r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 } } }$ exhibit higher TECs at elevated temperatures. At  

${ 1 3 0 0 } ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } ,$  

the TEC of $\mathrm { { D y _ { 2 } Z r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 } } }$ ceramic was reported to be  

$$
1 1 . 3 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 \circ } \mathrm { C } ^ { - 1 } ;
$$  

which is slightly higher than that of conventional 8wt% Y​2​ O​3​ $- Z \mathsf { r O } _ { 2 }$ ​ (8YSZ) [28]. Data on the temperature‐dependent TECs of various $\mathrm { L n _ { 2 } Z r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 } }$ compounds has also been presented [28].  

The suitability of these materials for high‐temperature applications is directly linked to their thermal stability and expansion behavior. High temperatures can induce phase transitions and sintering, which degrade performance. For example, 8YSZ, a commonly used material in related applications, is known to undergo undesirable phase changes and sintering at temperatures exceeding  

$\boldsymbol { 1 2 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C } }$ ,  

impacting its lifespan [7]. The intrinsic stability of zirconate structures at operating temperatures is therefore paramount.  

Doping plays a crucial role in enhancing the thermal stability of zirconia‐based materials and influencing potential phase transitions [17]. Similar to how yttrium doping imparts high‐temperature structural stability to otherwise unstable $Z \mathsf { r } 0 _ { 2 }$ [25], aliovalent doping in zirconates (e.g., perovskite‐type $\mathrm { { B a Z r O _ { 3 } } }$ ​ or pyrochlore‐type $\mathrm { L n _ { 2 } Z r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 } }$ ) can suppress detrimental phase transformations and improve structural integrity at elevated temperatures. While specific details on doping effects on phase transitions in the cited zirconates were not extensively provided, the principle established for related $Z \mathsf { r } 0 _ { 2 }$ ​ systems highlights the importance of dopant selection and concentration for achieving stable proton‐ conducting phases suitable for high‐temperature operation.​  

A significant challenge in integrating zirconate electrolytes or other components into hydrogen devices is the thermal expansion mismatch with adjacent materials, such as electrodes, interconnects, and sealing materials. Large differences in TECs can lead to significant mechanical stress during thermal cycling, potentially causing cracking, delamination, and loss of interfacial contact, ultimately leading to device failure. Comparing the TECs presented, $\mathrm { B a Z r O _ { 3 } }$ ​ (estimated  

$$
7 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }
$$  

at high temperature) has a considerably lower expansion than $\mathrm { { D y _ { 2 } Z r _ { 2 } O _ { 7 } } }$ $\mathbf { \cdot 1 1 . 3 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } } \mathbf { ^ { \circ } C ^ { - 1 } }$ at $\mathrm { 1 3 0 0 ^ { \circ } C }$ ). This variation underscores the need for careful material selection and matching of TECs for all components within a device stack to minimize internal stresses and ensure mechanical reliability under operational thermal gradients and cycling. Research is ongoing to tailor the composition and microstructure of zirconates and interfacing layers to mitigate the effects of thermal expansion mismatch.​

Proton-conducting zirconates, particularly those with perovskite structures, represent a critical class of materials for electrochemical hydrogen devices due to their significant proton mobility at elevated temperatures. Understanding and optimizing proton dynamics and macroscopic conductivity are paramount for their successful application. This section provides a comprehensive overview of the experimental characterization of proton conductivity in various zirconates under different operating conditions, including the influence of temperature, humidity, and doping strategies [1,3,15,20,22,27,29].  

The dominant proton transport mechanisms, primarily the Grotthuss mechanism involving proton hopping and reorientation, are discussed in detail, along with associated activation energies that govern mobility and are sensitive to the local defect environment [8,15,23].​  

Furthermore, the impact of microstructural characteristics, such as grain size and grain boundary resistance, on the overall conductivity is evaluated, highlighting their often limiting role [1,3].  

Finally, the application of spectroscopic techniques to probe proton dynamics, including hydroxyl group rotation and hopping events, and their crucial coupling with lattice vibrations, such as phonon damping effects, is analyzed to provide deeper insights into the fundamental processes governing proton transport [1,4,23,26].  

# 5.1 Proton Transport Mechanisms  

Proton transport in solid electrolytes, particularly in perovskite zirconates, primarily occurs via the Grotthuss mechanism [8,15,23]. This mechanism involves two principal steps: proton hopping and hydroxide ion reorientation (rotation) [15,23]. Proton hopping refers to the transfer of a proton from one oxygen ion to an adjacent oxygen ion. In perovskite lattices, these hopping processes can include intraedge, interedge, and intraoctahedron pathways, as illustrated in detail elsewhere [16]. Following hopping, the newly formed O–H bond must reorient to facilitate subsequent proton transfer events, requiring the rotation of the hydroxide ion [15,23].​  

The efficiency of proton mobility is significantly influenced by the local chemical environment and defect structure [15]. Factors such as defect concentration play a critical role. For instance, in doped zirconates, the presence of trivalent dopants (M) can create negatively charged $\mathbf { M } _ { B } ^ { \prime }$ ​ defects. These defects electrostatically attract positively charged protons, leading to “proton trapping” which increases the energy barrier for migration and hinders proton transport [15]. Temperature also strongly influences proton mobility, as the hopping and reorientation steps require overcoming specific energy barriers.  

Experimental evidence supports the Grotthuss mechanism in various materials, including high-entropy oxides and perovskites, where the presence of a conductivity isotope effect is often cited as confirmation of proton contribution and the Grotthuss process [20,22]. Low activation energies ( $E _ { a } < 0 . 4 ~ \mathrm { e V } )$ are also indicative of transport via the Grotthuss mechanism, as observed in some proton exchange membrane materials [8]. The activation energies for the elementary steps (hopping and reorientation) depend on the local chemical and defect environment, directly influencing the overall proton conductivity [15]. While the primary mechanism in many oxide proton conductors is Grotthuss-type bulk diffusion, alternative or complementary mechanisms can exist, such as the interface charge layer mechanism proposed for $\mathsf { C e O } _ { \varepsilon ^ { - \delta } }$ , where proton transport is confined to near-surface regions with lower activation energy [9].​  

# 5.2 Conductivity Measurements and Analysis  

Protonic conductivity in zirconate‐based perovskites is a critical parameter determining their efficacy in hydrogen devices. Typical conductivity values reported for high‐performance protonic ceramic electrolytes fall within the range of $1 0 ^ { - 2 } { - } 1 0 ^ { - 3 } \ S c m ^ { - 1 }$  

at temperatures around  

$$
6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }
$$  

[27]. However, this conductivity generally exhibits a notable decline as temperature decreases [27].  

Comparative studies highlight the influence of composition and structure on conductivity. For instance, a yttrium‐doped barium zirconate (BZY-15) electrolyte demonstrated superior proton conductivity and a lower activation energy of $0 . 3 2 \ : \mathrm { e V }$ compared to bulk BZY materials incorporating NiO additives, which showed an activation energy of $0 . 4 4 \mathrm { e V }$ [3]. The activation energy for bulk proton conduction in hexagonal materials, such as some scandate perovskites, is significantly higher, approximately $0 . 7 7 - 0 . 8 0 \ : \mathrm { e V } _ { \mathrm { : } }$ , leading to conductivities at least two orders of magnitude lower than their cubic counterparts [26]. This structural difference underscores the strong correlation between crystal phase and proton transport kinetics. Conductivity data has also been reported for yttrium-doped barium zirconate with CuO addition and  

$$
S r Z r _ { 0 . 9 } Y _ { 0 . 1 } O _ { 2 . 9 5 }
$$  

with ZnO addition, further illustrating the impact of specific dopants and additives [29]. High-entropy oxides (HEOs) based on the perovskite structure represent another class of materials where conductivity varies with composition; HEOs with five elements on the B-site typically exhibit higher total conductivity than those with seven elements [20,22]. The activation energy for total conductivity in a wet atmosphere for a specific high-entropy composition,  

$$
B a Z r _ { 0 . 2 } S n _ { 0 . 2 } T i _ { 0 . 2 } H f _ { 0 . 2 } Y _ { 0 . 2 } O _ { 3 - \delta } ,
$$  

was measured as $0 . 5 3 \mathrm { e V }$ , which is lower than values often observed for low-entropy doped barium zirconates [20].  

Beyond bulk properties, microstructural features significantly limit overall conductivity in proton-conducting ceramics, particularly the contribution of grain boundaries [1]. Grain boundaries often present higher resistance pathways for proton  

transport compared to the grain bulk due to factors like impurity segregation, structural disorder, and space charge effects. The influence of microstructural properties is also evident in studies focusing on thin films, where factors such as surface defect engineering and the presence of excess barium  

$$
B a _ { 1 + x } Z r _ { 0 . 8 } Y _ { 0 . 2 } O _ { 3 - \delta }
$$  

have been investigated for their effects on proton conductivity [24]. Improved contact resistance at interfaces, such as the anode interface in electrochemical cells, can also lead to reduced Ohmic and anodic resistances, likely associated with the formation of beneficial interfacial layers [27]. Materials design strategies, such as the creation of core–shell structures as demonstrated in  

$$
C e O _ { 2 }
$$  

based systems, can also influence conductivity, particularly at lower operating temperatures [9].  

Conductivity measurements are typically performed using techniques like Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) [9], often conducted under controlled atmospheres (e.g., hydrogen/air, wet vs. dry air) and temperatures [9,22]. In dry air, charge carriers may include oxygen ions or electronic species, resulting in higher activation energy compared to humidified conditions where proton conduction dominates [22]. Specialized techniques like Electrical Conductivity Relaxation (ECR) and Isotope Exchange Diffusion Profile (IEDP) are employed to deconvolute oxygen and proton transport properties, respectively [21]. While not a direct conductivity measurement technique, analysis of phonon damping using terahertz and infrared spectroscopy can also provide insights into proton dynamics within the lattice [23].  

For comparative context, classic oxygen ion conductors like yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) and scandia-stabilized zirconia (ScSZ) exhibit high ionic conductivity at elevated temperatures (e.g., 0.042 S/cm for YSZ at $8 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ , $0 . 1 0 5 / \mathsf { c m }$ for ScSZ at 800 $^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ , while magnesium-doped lanthanum gallate (LSGM) shows high values (0.12 to $0 . 1 4 \mathsf { S } / \mathsf { c m }$ ) at intermediate temperatures $( 7 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ [25]. These comparisons highlight the distinct operational temperature ranges and transport mechanisms of different electrolyte materials used in solid oxide cells.  

# 5.3 Proton Dynamics (Vibrational/Spectroscopic Studies)  

Spectroscopic techniques, including terahertz spectroscopy, infrared (IR) reflection spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy, are indispensable tools for investigating the nature of proton species and their dynamic behavior, as well as the intricate interactions between protons and the host lattice in proton-conducting zirconates [1,4,23]. These methods probe the vibrational modes associated with proton incorporation and transport [4].  

Analysis of vibrational spectra, particularly the O–H stretching $( v ( \mathsf { O } - \mathsf { H } ) )$ and bending (δ(O–H)) modes, provides significant insights into the local environment of protons. For instance, IR spectra exhibit the main $v ( 0 \mathrm { - } \mathsf { H } )$ band, the position of which reflects the strength of hydrogen bonding [26]. A shift of the band to lower energy (red-shift) typically indicates stronger hydrogen bonds [26]. Furthermore, the presence of additional, well-defined peaks in the IR or inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectra suggests the existence of multiple distinct proton sites within the lattice structure [26].  

Studies on Sc-doped $\mathrm { B a Z r O _ { 3 } }$ ​ (BTS) have shown that the spectral features, such as the position and width of peaks in both IR and Raman spectra, vary significantly depending on the dopant concentration and the resulting crystal structure (cubic versus hexagonal phases) [26]. For example, the hexagonal phases of BTS exhibit stronger hydrogen bonds compared to the cubic phases, as indicated by an overall blue-shift of the δ(O–H) band and a corresponding red-shift of the ν(O–H) band [26]. The distinct peaks observed in the δ(O–H) region for the hexagonal phase suggest multiple proton environments, contrasting with the broader bands seen in the cubic phase [26]. Similarly, changes in IR and Raman spectra with varying In concentration in $\mathrm { B a Z r O _ { 3 } }$ ​ provide insights into how structural distortions influence the local environment of protons [4].  

Beyond characterizing static proton environments, spectroscopic studies delve into the dynamic aspects of proton motion and its coupling with lattice vibrations. Terahertz, IR reflection, and Raman spectroscopies have been utilized to investigate proton dynamics by analyzing vibrational modes and the damping of phonons [23]. These studies reveal a strong coupling between the motion of protons and specific phonon modes of the host lattice [23]. Crucially, the nature and strength of this coupling have been shown to be dependent on the type of acceptor dopant [23]. Understanding this proton–phonon coupling is essential as it directly impacts the energy barriers and pathways for proton migration, thereby influencing macroscopic proton conductivity. Raman spectroscopy, in particular, has been employed to gain insights into how this coupling can lead to the modulation of proton conductivity in doped zirconates like Y-doped $\mathrm { { B a ( Z r , C e ) O _ { 3 } } }$ ​ [1]. Thus, vibrational spectroscopy offers a powerful means to spectroscopically fingerprint proton defects, probe their diverse local environments, and elucidate their dynamic interactions with the surrounding lattice, which are fundamental to understanding and optimizing proton transport.  

# 6. Stability and Durability  

Achieving long-term stability and durability is a paramount challenge for the practical application of proton-conducting zirconates in various hydrogen devices, including fuel cells, electrolyzers, and gas separation membranes. These materials must withstand challenging operating environments characterized by factors such as high temperatures, high steam partial pressures, reactions with acidic gases like $C O _ { 2 }$ ​ , and potential redox cycling [1,3]. Understanding and mitigating degradation mechanisms is crucial for widespread implementation.  

![](images/bdf0b58befef23b5b8d1b19c6170434b105c3d2e9905bcb8d0fb98646e4791a7.jpg)  

Several degradation pathways impact the performance and longevity of proton-conducting zirconates. A primary concern is chemical instability, particularly the reactivity with $H _ { 2 } O$ and $C O _ { 2 }$ ​ . For instance, while $B a ( C e , Z r , Y , Y b ) O _ { 3 - \delta }$ ​ (BCZYYb) electrolytes can exhibit significant resistance increases due to electrolyte corrosion under high steam pressure, $B a ( Z r , Y ) O _ { 3 - \delta }$ (BZY) electrolytes demonstrate superior chemical stability, maintaining stable resistance under similar harsh steam conditions [3]. This difference highlights the critical role of zirconium content in enhancing resistance to steaminduced corrosion compared to cerium-rich compositions, which are more susceptible to degradation in $H _ { 2 } O$ - and $C O _ { 2 }$ ​ - containing atmospheres [15]. Another relevant degradation mode, particularly in applications involving hydrocarbon fuels or supports, is carbon deposition, which can deactivate catalysts or hinder mass transport [30]. While the provided information points to carbon deposition on catalytic supports [30], this mechanism is also pertinent to materials exposed to carbon-containing environments. Although not specific to zirconates, insights from degradation in other high-temperature ceramic systems, such as CMAS corrosion in YSZ thermal barrier coatings or degradation of Ni-YSZ electrodes involving particle aggregation and oxidation [7,25], underscore the complex interactions and challenges faced in such operational conditions. Specific mechanisms like A-site cation segregation to grain boundaries are also known factors contributing to performance degradation in perovskite oxides, although detailed analysis of this specific mechanism in the provided digests is limited.  

Strategies aimed at improving the stability of proton-conducting zirconates primarily focus on compositional engineering and microstructural control. Tuning the composition, particularly through solid solution formation between less stable $B a C e O _ { 3 }$ ​ and more stable $B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ​ , is a key approach. Introducing zirconium into barium cerates, as in the $B a C e _ { 1 - x } Z r _ { x } O _ { 3 }$ ​ system, significantly enhances resistance to degradation from $H _ { 2 } O$ and $C O _ { 2 }$ ​ [3,15]. $B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ​ -based electrolytes, specifically, are recognized for their excellent chemical stability in humid and $C O _ { 2 }$ ​ -rich environments, effectively preventing the corrosion issues observed in cerium-based materials, especially under high steam pressure [3,15]. Performance testing has corroborated this, with BZY cells demonstrating remarkably stable voltage and resistance over hundreds of hours under high steam pressure, unlike BCZYYb cells which showed significant degradation [3]. Doping with aliovalent cations, while primarily used for conductivity enhancement, can also influence stability by affecting structural tolerance or suppressing segregation. Furthermore, achieving a dense microstructure, often facilitated by sintering aids [15], is vital as it minimizes pathways for reactive species ingress, thus improving durability.  

Despite these advancements, achieving sufficient long-term durability for practical applications remains a significant challenge. Balancing high proton conductivity with exceptional chemical and thermomechanical stability is a continuous research focus. While Zr-based compositions offer superior stability, improvements in conductivity and sintering activity are still sought [32]. Conversely, enhancing the stability of more conductive Ce-based compositions continues to be necessary [32]. Addressing complex degradation mechanisms involving interfaces, electrode interactions, and operation under demanding, multi-component atmospheres requires ongoing research into material design, processing, and system integration. The long-term challenges for barium-based cerates and zirconates include simultaneously improving conductivity, stability, and sintering activity for robust performance in hydrogen devices [32].  

# 6.1 Degradation Mechanisms  

The long-term operational stability of proton-conducting zirconates in various hydrogen devices is significantly impacted by various degradation mechanisms. Understanding these pathways is crucial for the design and implementation of durable materials and systems. One primary mode of degradation observed in proton-conducting ceramic electrolytes, particularly under demanding conditions, is chemical corrosion. For instance, studies have shown that BCZYYb (\\(Ba(Ce,Zr,Y,Yb)O_{3- \\delta}\\)) cell electrolytes exhibit significant resistance increases when exposed to high steam pressure, indicative of chemical degradation or corrosion [3]. In contrast, BZY $\left( \backslash \backslash ( \mathsf { B a } ( Z \mathsf { r } , \mathsf { Y } ) 0 \_ \{ 3 \ - \backslash \backslash \mathsf { d e l t a } \} \backslash \backslash ) \right)$ electrolytes demonstrated superior chemical stability, maintaining stable resistance under the same high steam pressure conditions, highlighting the compositional dependence of chemical durability in zirconate systems [3]. This comparative behavior underscores the importance of zirconium content and specific dopants in enhancing resistance to steam-induced corrosion.  

Beyond electrolyte degradation, the overall performance of devices incorporating proton-conducting zirconates can be compromised by phenomena occurring at the interfaces or on adjacent components. In catalytic applications utilizing proton-conducting perovskites as supports, carbon deposition on the catalyst surface has been identified as a primary degradation mechanism, leading to catalyst deactivation [30]. This process involves the formation of carbon species from hydrocarbon fuels, which can block active sites and pores, hindering mass transport and catalytic activity. While this specific example pertains to a perovskite support, similar carbon deposition issues can arise in devices utilizing proton-conducting zirconates, especially in the presence of hydrocarbon fuels.​  

Although not directly related to proton-conducting zirconates, other degradation mechanisms observed in hightemperature ceramic materials used in similar environments provide relevant context. For example, in thermal barrier coatings like YSZ (yttria‐stabilized zirconia), failure mechanisms include CMAS (calcium–magnesium–alumino–silicate) corrosion [7]. Furthermore, YSZ can undergo detrimental phase transitions and sintering when operated at temperatures exceeding $1 2 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for extended periods [7]. These examples from related ceramic systems highlight the challenges posed by high temperatures and reactive species in degrading material properties, potentially informing considerations for the longterm stability of proton-conducting zirconates under similar operational stresses. Similarly, degradation of Ni-8YSZ fuel electrodes in solid oxide cells, involving Ni-particle aggregation, dislocation, and oxidation to inactive NiO, illustrates issues faced by metallic components interacting with ceramic electrolytes [25]. While distinct from zirconate degradation, these examples emphasize the multifaceted nature of degradation in high-temperature electrochemical devices, often involving complex interactions between different cell components and the operating environment.  

# 6.2 Strategies for Improving Stability  

A critical challenge for proton-conducting zirconates and cerates in hydrogen devices is their chemical stability, particularly under demanding operating conditions involving steam, CO2, and reducing atmospheres. Degradation often occurs via reactions that disrupt the perovskite structure, such as carbonation and hydration-induced decomposition, leading to decreased proton conductivity and mechanical integrity. Various strategies have been explored to mitigate these issues and enhance the long-term durability of these materials.  

One widely adopted strategy involves tuning the composition, primarily through solid solution formation between more conductive but less stable BaCeO3 (BC) and less conductive but more stable BaZrO3 (BZ). The BaCe $_ { 1 - x } Z \ r \ r _ { \mathrm { ~ } x }$ O3 (BCZ) system represents an effort to balance proton conductivity with chemical robustness [15]. Compared to pure BaCeO3, the introduction of zirconium significantly improves the resistance of the material to degradation mechanisms driven by reactions with atmospheric components like H2O and CO2 [3,15]. Specifically, BaZrO3-based (BZY) electrolytes demonstrate enhanced stability by effectively avoiding corrosion issues, particularly under high steam pressure, a condition where Cebased electrolytes are prone to significant degradation [3]. This compositional modification directly addresses the susceptibility of the Ce–O bond to attack by acidic species formed from H2O and CO2, with the more stable Zr–O bond providing greater resilience.  

Beyond fundamental composition tuning, other methods contribute to optimizing both performance and stability. Doping with aliovalent cations (e.g., Y, Yb) is a common technique to introduce oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for proton incorporation and transport. While primarily aimed at enhancing conductivity, doping can also influence chemical stability by affecting the tolerance factor of the perovskite structure or suppressing detrimental phase segregations. Additionally, the use of sintering aids facilitates the fabrication of dense ceramic electrolytes [15]. A dense microstructure is crucial for stability, as it minimizes open porosity and grain boundaries, which can serve as pathways for reactive gases to infiltrate the material and initiate degradation processes. Therefore, achieving high density through optimized sintering techniques, potentially involving sintering aids, is an important aspect of improving the overall durability of proton-conducting zirconates and cerates.​  

# 7. Strategies for Enhancing Performance  

![](images/ad2dd6c7735a17f3c66013927eb74c05d4e7fce324dd7d5f0b1f57c14318b4a7.jpg)  

![](images/8a49116bd5b55391c9db79c387494def86ddb94c97af81be9a07bc1c6013c52d.jpg)  

Enhancing the performance of proton-conducting zirconates is critical for their successful implementation in hydrogen devices. This objective is pursued through a variety of strategies targeting improvements in proton conductivity, chemical and mechanical stability, and electrochemical activity across a range of operating temperatures [15,18]. These strategies can be broadly categorized into material design at the atomic and microstructural levels, specifically focusing on doping, compositional engineering via composites and heterostructures, meticulous control of microstructure and nanostructuring, and tailoring of surface properties [1,9,11].  

A fundamental strategy involves doping, particularly the introduction of aliovalent dopants into the zirconate lattice, which primarily serves to generate oxygen vacancies crucial for the hydration reaction and the incorporation of protonic defects [18,20,28]. B-site doping, notably with trivalent elements such as Y and In in $B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ​ , is widely studied, influencing shortrange structure, proton conductivity, chemical stability, and sinterability [3,4,15,29]. Beyond single substitution, co-doping strategies, involving both A-site and B-site modifications, are employed to achieve synergistic effects. Examples include codoping $B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ​ with Gd and Zn for enhanced mechanical properties and conductivity, or Bi and In for improved stability and performance in H-SOFCs [6,11]. Doping at different sites can also modify thermal properties, as seen with rare-earth doping in lanthanum zirconate increasing its thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) [28]. Ultimately, dopant selection impacts proton motion and its coupling with lattice vibrations [23], although the direct correlation between dopant and oxygen vacancy formation energy is not always straightforward [15].  

The utilization of composite materials and heterostructures represents another powerful approach, leveraging the synergistic combination of different phases or materials to optimize various functional requirements simultaneously [3,21,29]. Interfaces between distinct phases are critical in these architectures, profoundly influencing proton transport pathways and electrochemical reaction kinetics [9]. Heterostructures, such as core–shell designs, can be specifically engineered to enhance proton conductivity or serve as highly active electrocatalysts by modifying electronic structure through interfacial strain and effects [9,19]. Composites combining zirconates with other conductors, or multi-phase composites, demonstrate improved performance over single components [8,21,29]. Furthermore, multi-layer  

heterostructures are vital in device fabrication, enabling strategies like preventing interdiffusion between support and electrolyte layers to maintain chemical integrity and conductivity [3].  

Controlling microstructure and utilizing nanostructuring techniques are paramount for optimizing performance, impacting proton conductivity, mechanical stability, and electrode kinetics [14,15,18]. Achieving high relative density in electrolyte layers is crucial for minimizing gas permeation and maximizing ionic transport [3]. Electrolyte thickness directly affects ohmic resistance; reducing thickness to the micrometer or sub-micrometer scale effectively lowers overall cell resistance [15,18,27]. While grain refinement can enhance mechanical stability [15], the optimal grain size for conductivity appears complex and potentially dependent on the specific architecture and density achieved [3]. Nanostructuring techniques, including thin-film electrolytes and 3D nanostructured electrodes, are key for reducing ohmic and polarization resistances [15,18]. Control over porosity, especially in support layers, is managed through processing parameters like pore formers and sintering conditions [14]. Rational control over nanoscale features like size, shape, crystallinity, and pore structure can create tailored pathways for proton transport [8,19].​  

Finally, tailoring surface properties and employing surface modification techniques are crucial for enhancing proton conduction and catalytic activity, particularly at lower temperatures [1]. Surface hydration and the formation of hydrogen bond networks are essential for proton transport [8]. Modifying surfaces to increase hydrophilicity or engineer surface defect chemistry can boost proton conduction, as demonstrated by the $C e O _ { 2 } / C e O _ { 2 - \delta }$ ​ core–shell structure [8,9]. Surface modification is also vital for improving catalytic activity, especially for electrode reactions. Techniques include tailoring surface structure (e.g., high-index facets) and composition (e.g., core–shell structures for electronic tuning via $d .$ -band center modification), and applying protective or synergistic coatings [15,19]. Coatings, including zirconate-based ones like YSZ, can enhance the catalysis or stability of active electrode materials and improve durability against oxidation or corrosion, extending beyond proton conduction applications [7,15]. These diverse strategies highlight the profound impact of the material surface and interface on overall performance [1].​  

In summary, a multifaceted approach involving optimized doping, rational design of composites and heterostructures, precise control of microstructure and nanostructuring, and deliberate surface engineering is required to address the challenges and enhance the performance of proton-conducting zirconates for next-generation hydrogen devices. Current research continues to explore the complex interplay between material synthesis, structure, and properties to unlock their full potential.​  

# 7.1 Doping Strategies  

Doping is recognized as a pivotal strategy for tailoring the properties of proton‐conducting zirconates, particularly for applications in low‐temperature solid oxide cells (LT-SOCs) [18]. The introduction of aliovalent dopants, typically through acceptor‐type substitution, is a common method to generate oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for the subsequent hydration reaction and the incorporation of protonic defects into the lattice [20].  

Extensive research has focused on B‐site doping in the archetypal proton conductor, barium zirconate $( B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ). Yttrium (Y) doping, for instance, is widely employed and its impact on the structural and electrochemical properties of barium zirconate has been thoroughly investigated [29]. A notable example is $B a Z r _ { 0 . 8 } Y _ { 0 . 2 } O _ { 3 - \delta }$ ​ (BZY), which serves as a common electrolyte material in proton ceramic fuel cells [3]. Indium (In) doping in $B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ​ also significantly influences both the short‐range structure and the proton‐conducting properties, with the specific concentration of In affecting the local environment and thus proton transport [4].​  

Beyond single‐element substitution, co‐doping strategies involving both A‐site and B‐site modifications are utilized to optimize the perovskite structure and enhance performance [6]. For $B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ​ , co‐doping with elements like gadolinium (Gd) and zinc (Zn) has demonstrated synergistic effects, leading to enhanced mechanical properties alongside high proton conductivity, making these materials suitable for intermediate‐temperature solid oxide fuel cells (IT‐SOFCs) [11]. Similarly, the co‐doping of bismuth (Bi) and indium (In) in barium zirconate has been explored as a strategy to develop stable and efficient proton conductors for high‐performance hydrogen‐fueled solid oxide fuel cells (H‐SOFCs) [11]. These co‐doping approaches highlight the ability to simultaneously address multiple material requirements, such as conductivity, stability, and mechanical integrity, which often represent trade‐offs in single‐dopant systems [11].  

While focusing on proton conductors, doping in related zirconate systems provides insights into structural modifications. In rare earth zirconates, A‐site doping with trivalent rare‐earth elements can alter thermal properties, such as thermal conductivity and thermal expansion coefficient (TEC). For example, substituting elements like neodymium (Nd), europium (Eu), or gadolinium (Gd) at the A‐site of lanthanum zirconate increases its TEC [28]. This underscores that doping at different lattice sites can significantly modify the physical and functional properties of the zirconate structure.  

Fundamentally, the choice of dopants exerts a significant influence on proton motion and its coupling with the lattice vibrations (phonons), thereby affecting the overall proton conduction mechanism [23]. Understanding the impact of dopant type and concentration on oxygen vacancy formation and subsequent hydration energy is critical. However, direct correlations between the specific dopant ion and the formation energy of oxygen vacancies are not always straightforward or universally observed across different materials systems [15]. This complexity necessitates careful experimental investigation and theoretical modeling to predict and optimize the performance of doped zirconate proton conductors.  

# 7.2 Composites and Heterostructures  

The development of high-performance proton-conducting materials for hydrogen devices often necessitates the utilization of composite materials and heterostructures. This approach is primarily driven by the rationale of combining the advantageous properties of different phases or materials to achieve synergistic effects that surpass the capabilities of single components. Composites allow for the optimization of distinct functions within a single architecture, such as enhancing ionic conductivity, improving chemical or mechanical stability, facilitating electrochemical reactions, or managing interfacial phenomena [3,21,29].​  

Interfaces between different phases play a critical role in composite and heterostructured materials, significantly influencing proton transport pathways and electrochemical reaction kinetics [9]. The unique environment at interfaces, distinct from the bulk properties of the constituent materials, can either accelerate or impede proton conduction. For instance, a $\mathsf { C e O _ { 2 } } / \mathsf { C e O _ { 2 } } \mathsf { E }$ core–shell structure is designed as a heterostructure explicitly to enhance proton conductivity, suggesting that the interface or the strain/defect structure induced by the shell on the core is beneficial for proton transport [9]. Similarly, core–shell structures are widely explored as electrocatalysts for reactions like the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells [19]. These structures, formed by depositing precious or non-precious metal layers onto different cores, leverage interfacial effects and strain engineering to modify the electronic structure of the active sites, thereby enhancing catalytic activity and potentially interacting with proton transport at the electrode–electrolyte interface [19].​  

Various composite designs have demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing performance. Zirconates, typically good hightemperature proton conductors, can be combined with low-temperature proton conductors like sulfates to form Zirconates/Sulfates Composites. This design aims to create materials effective over a wider temperature range by integrating phases with complementary conductivity regimes [29]. Another strategy involves forming multi-phase composites where the synergistic interaction between phases leads to improved performance. A BPHYC composite consisting of BYC, PBC, and BHY phases exemplifies this, showing enhanced electrochemical performance attributed to the combined contributions and interactions of its constituent materials [21]. The effectiveness can also stem from incorporating a known proton conductor into a different matrix; for example, loading phosphoric acid $( H _ { 3 } P O _ { 4 } )$ into an NKCOF structure results in a composite membrane with significantly improved proton conductivity compared to the pristine material [8].​  

Beyond simple mixing, layered heterostructures are crucial in device fabrication. A half-cell structure featuring a BCZY+NiO support layer, a $B Z Y + N i O$ buffer layer, and a BZY electrolyte layer illustrates how multi-layer design addresses specific functional requirements [3]. In this configuration, the BCZY+NiO support layer facilitates densification of the overall structure, while the BZY+NiO buffer layer serves a critical role in inhibiting the diffusion of Ce from the support layer into the BZY electrolyte. This prevention of interdiffusion at the interface is vital for maintaining the chemical integrity and optimal conductivity of the electrolyte layer, demonstrating the strategic use of interfacial engineering in device architecture [3]. The diverse examples highlight that effective composite and heterostructure design involves careful selection of constituent materials, optimization of their relative proportions, and precise control over the interfaces to leverage synergistic effects for improved proton transport and electrochemical activity.​  

# 7.3 Microstructure and Nanostructuring Control  

Controlling the microstructure of proton‐conducting zirconates, including parameters such as grain size, density, porosity, and thickness, is paramount for optimizing proton conductivity and ensuring adequate mechanical stability in hydrogen devices [14,15,18]. A high relative density in the electrolyte layer is generally desirable to minimize gas permeation and maximize ionic transport pathways, as demonstrated by structures achieving over $9 5 \%$ relative density which correlated  

with high performance [3]. In contrast, structures with lower densities ${ \approx } 7 8 \%$ relative density) and significant porosity exhibit diminished performance [3]. The importance of density and the presence of defects like pores and cracks are analogous to observations in thermal barrier coatings, where they influence functional properties [7]. Achieving optimal density and controlled porosity, particularly in support layers, can be managed through processing parameters such as the use of pore formers and optimization of sintering temperature and time [14].  

Electrolyte thickness is another critical microstructural parameter directly impacting ohmic resistance [15,18]. Reducing electrolyte thickness, for instance, to approximately $1 0 \mu \mathrm m$ in spin‐coated dense films, is an effective strategy to lower overall cell resistance [27]. Coupled with refined grains, reduced thickness can also contribute to improved mechanical stability of the electrolyte layer [15].​  

However, the influence of grain size on performance appears complex and context‐dependent. While refining grains can enhance mechanical stability [15], a high‐performance BCZY‐supported structure featured notably larger grain sizes ( $3 . 1 \mu \mathrm { m }$ ) compared to traditional structures $( 1 . 1 \mu \mathrm { m } )$ ) [3]. This suggests that in certain architectures, particularly dense, supported structures, larger grains might be beneficial for conductivity or that their positive effect is coupled with the achievement of high density. Separately, smaller particle sizes $( \approx 3 0 \mathrm { n m }$ ) have been noted to potentially contribute to enhanced performance in different material contexts, possibly related to increased surface area or optimized contact points [21]. Control over grain size, alongside density and porosity, is achievable by adjusting sintering conditions [14].  

Specific nanostructuring techniques offer further avenues for performance optimization. The utilization of thin‐film electrolytes, including free‐standing and supported configurations, directly reduces ohmic losses [15]. Supported electrolytes, built upon a porous matrix, provide increased mechanical support and resistance to thermal shocks [15]. Depositing functional layers onto a porous base to form a bilayer matrix has been shown to improve cell performance, especially at lower temperatures [15]. The development of core–shell structures, controllable by annealing temperature, represents another approach to engineer material properties at the nanoscale [9]. Beyond electrolytes, nanostructuring is vital for electrodes, where the development of 3D nanostructured electrodes is crucial for reducing polarization resistance [18]. More broadly, the ability to rationally control the size, shape, crystallinity, and structure of materials at the nanoscale, as demonstrated for electrocatalysts synthesis, underscores the potential for tailored performance in energy conversion technologies [19]. High crystallinity and engineered pore structures, such as those found in ordered materials, are also key as they can create well‐defined pathways that facilitate proton transport [8]. Thus, deliberate control over microstructure and the application of specific nanostructuring techniques are essential for tailoring the properties and enhancing the performance and stability of proton‐conducting zirconate‐based hydrogen devices.​  

# 7.4 Surface Properties and Modification  

Surface properties play a critical role in the performance of proton-conducting materials, particularly influencing proton conduction mechanisms and catalytic activity, especially at lower temperatures [1]. A key aspect is the interaction of the material surface with water. Surface hydration is crucial as it facilitates the accumulation of protons and establishes hydrogen bond networks essential for proton transport [8]. The introduction of hydrophilic functional groups on material surfaces, such as phenol hydroxyl and azo groups, can significantly enhance water uptake and the formation of these conductive hydrogen bond pathways [8].  

Surface modification strategies are widely employed to optimize material performance by tailoring these surface properties [1]. These strategies can target different objectives, including enhancing proton conductivity, improving catalytic or electrocatalytic activity, or increasing material stability.  

One approach focuses directly on improving surface proton conduction. For instance, modifying the surface of $C e O _ { 2 }$ ​ to create a $C e O _ { 2 - \delta }$ shell with a high concentration of oxygen vacancies has been shown to significantly enhance proton conductivity [9]. This suggests that controlling the defect chemistry near the surface is a viable route to boosting proton transport.​  

Another significant area of surface modification is aimed at enhancing catalytic or electrocatalytic activity, particularly relevant in devices like fuel cells. Strategies include tailoring the surface structure and composition of catalyst materials. For platinum $\left( \mathsf { P t } \right)$ and $\mathsf { P t }$ -alloy nanocrystals used in anodic electrooxidation reactions, modifying surface properties, such as utilizing high-index facets or implementing core-shell structures, can dramatically enhance catalytic activity [19]. The catalytic activity is strongly correlated with the binding energy of adsorbents, which is influenced by the $d .$ -band center of Pt.  

The position of the $d .$ -band center can be tuned by adjusting factors like strain and electronic effects through varying core compositions and shell thicknesses in core-shell catalysts [19].  

Coating the skeleton of electrodes with thin films represents another effective surface modification technique to enhance stability and electrocatalytic activity [15]. Specific examples include the use of a $Z r O _ { 2 }$ ​ capping layer on a Pt cathode, which can lower the polarization resistance, and a YSZ (yttria-stabilized zirconia) overcoat, which enhances the catalysis of Pt [15]. These examples highlight how relatively inert oxide coatings, including those based on zirconates like YSZ, can positively influence the performance of active catalyst surfaces.​  

Beyond catalytic activity and proton conduction, surface modification can also improve the structural and chemical stability of materials. For instance, modifying plasma-sprayed physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD) 7YSZ thermal barrier coatings with $A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 }$ ​ has been shown to enhance their resistance to oxidation and CMAS (calcium–magnesium–aluminum–silicate) corrosion [7]. While this application is focused on high-temperature stability rather than proton conduction, it demonstrates the versatility of surface modification techniques for improving the durability of zirconate-based materials.  

Comparing these strategies, modifications for proton conduction often involve increasing surface hydrophilicity or defect concentration, while modifications for catalysis focus on electronic structure (e.g., $d .$ -band center tuning), surface facets, or protective/synergistic coatings. Modifications for stability typically involve applying diffusion barriers or chemically resistant layers. The effectiveness of these diverse surface engineering approaches underscores the critical influence of the material interface on overall performance in various applications [1]. Characterization techniques are essential for analyzing the modified surfaces and understanding the effects of these treatments, although specific techniques were not detailed in the provided digests.​  

# 8. Beyond Conventional Zirconates  

Beyond the traditional realm of cubic and orthorhombic perovskite zirconates, the exploration of alternative crystal structures and novel compositional approaches represents a significant thrust in the search for advanced protonconducting materials for hydrogen devices. This section delves into materials that deviate from the conventional perovskite zirconate framework, specifically examining non-perovskite zirconate structures and the emerging class of high-entropy oxides based on zirconate compositions [2,13,20,22].  

Alternative solid oxide systems, including hexagonal perovskite derivatives, brownmillerite, and scheelite structures, have been identified as materials capable of incorporating and transporting protonic defects [2,13]. These structures possess different lattice arrangements compared to the cubic or orthorhombic perovskite, which inherently influences their defect chemistry and proton conduction pathways. While some of these alternative structures have shown ionic conductivity comparable to conventional perovskite conductors, a detailed, systematic comparison of their specific crystal structures, the impact of these differences on proton conduction mechanisms, and potential advantages in terms of stability, conductivity (particularly at lower temperatures), or cost requires more focused analysis [2,13]. Similarly, the challenges associated with the synthesis and processing of these novel, non-perovskite structures warrant further investigation to assess their viability for practical applications.​  

Concurrently, the development of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) has introduced a paradigm shift in materials design, moving beyond single- or limited-element doping strategies [20]. HEOs, typically defined by the presence of five or more principal elements in significant concentrations on a single crystallographic site, form solid solutions that exhibit unique structural and functional properties arising from high configurational entropy, severe lattice distortion, sluggish diffusion, and cocktail effects [20]. Applying this high-entropy concept to perovskite compositions containing zirconium offers a novel approach for designing proton conductors [20,22].  

The synthesis of single-phase high-entropy zirconates presents a significant challenge due to the complex interplay of multiple cations with varying characteristics. Nevertheless, successful synthesis routes have been established for various Zrcontaining high-entropy perovskite compositions, demonstrating the feasibility of creating such complex solid solutions [20,22]. The inherent compositional disorder in these HEOs profoundly affects their crystal structure and defect landscape. The random occupation of B-sites by numerous cations induces significant local lattice distortions, potentially influencing oxygen vacancy formation and the subsequent incorporation of protons. This complexity leads to a diverse distribution of local environments, which is expected to impact proton hopping pathways and migration barriers [22]. The formation of protonic defects (\( \mathrm{H_{2}O} + V_{O}^{\bullet\bullet} $^ +$ O_{O}^{\times} \rightarrow 2\,OH_{O}^{\bullet} \)) has been confirmed in these high-entropy perovskites, and proton transport is the dominant conduction mechanism under humid conditions, evidenced by increased conductivity in humid atmospheres and an observed isotope effect [22].  

While the proton-conducting nature of several high-entropy zirconate compositions has been demonstrated, direct quantitative comparisons of their conductivity values and long-term stability relative to established conventional doped barium zirconates (e.g., Y-doped $B a Z r O _ { 3 } .$ ) are currently limited in the available literature [22]. The potential advantages stemming from the high compositional disorder, such as potentially enhanced defect concentrations, favorably altered proton dynamics, or improved tolerance to chemical degradation, are yet to be fully evaluated through systematic studies [22]. A comprehensive assessment of high-entropy zirconates requires detailed investigations into their total conductivity, proton mobility, chemical stability (particularly in $C O _ { 2 }$ - or water-containing environments), and mechanical properties, benchmarked against conventional proton conductors to fully ascertain their potential for widespread application in hydrogen technologies. Thus, exploring both non-perovskite structures and high-entropy approaches represents crucial directions for expanding the materials landscape beyond conventional perovskite zirconates.​  

# 8.1 Non-Perovskite Zirconate Structures  

Beyond the widely studied perovskite structures, alternative crystal structures involving zirconates have been explored as proton-conducting materials for hydrogen devices [2,13]. These non-perovskite zirconates offer different structural frameworks that may influence their proton transport properties. Notable examples of such alternative structures include hexagonal perovskite derivatives, brownmillerite, and scheelite structures [2,13]. Research has begun to overview these materials, exploring their potential as proton conductors and considering how their properties compare to conventional perovskite-type zirconates [2]. While these structures represent a departure from the typical cubic or orthorhombic perovskite framework, providing detailed descriptions of their specific crystal structures and how these differences impact proton conduction mechanisms or properties—including specific benefits or drawbacks compared to perovskites— necessitates further in-depth analysis of the literature beyond identification of the structure types [2,13].  

# 8.2 High Entropy Zirconates  

The concept of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) has emerged as a novel approach to materials design, extending beyond the traditional strategy of optimizing properties through single- or limited-component doping. HEOs are typically defined as solid solutions containing five or more principal metal elements in equimolar or near-equimolar ratios at a single crystallographic site, often forming simple structures like rock salt, spinel, fluorite, or perovskite [20]. This high degree of compositional complexity is hypothesized to lead to unique properties, including enhanced mechanical strength, catalytic activity, and potentially ionic conductivity, due to effects such as lattice distortion, sluggish diffusion, high entropy, and cocktail effects. Applying this concept to proton-conducting perovskites, particularly those based on zirconates, represents a promising avenue for developing advanced electrolyte materials for hydrogen-related devices [20,22].​  

Synthesizing single-phase high-entropy zirconates, however, presents significant challenges due to the large number of constituent elements and their varying ionic radii, valences, and coordination preferences. Achieving a stable, homogeneous solid solution structure requires careful control of synthesis parameters, often demanding high temperatures and specific processing routes to avoid phase segregation or the formation of secondary phases. Despite these complexities, studies have successfully synthesized high-entropy perovskites incorporating zirconium and other B-site cations. Examples of such compositions include  

BaZr0.2 ​Sn0.2 ​T i0.2 ​Hf0.2 ​Ce0.2 ​O3−δ ​ ,   
BaZr0.2 ​Sn0.2 ​T i0.2 ​Hf0.2 ​Y0.2 ​O3−δ ​ ,   
BaZr1/7 ​Sn1/7 ​T i1/7 ​Hf1/7 ​Ce1/7 ​Nb1/7 Y1/7 ​O3−δ ​ , and   
BaZr0.15 ​Sn0.15 ​T i0.15 ​Hf0.15 ​Ce0.15 ​Nb0.15 Y0.10 ​O3−δ ​ [20,22].  

The inherent compositional complexity in high-entropy zirconates is expected to profoundly influence their crystal structure and defect chemistry. The random distribution of multiple cations on the B-site in the perovskite structure $\mid A B O _ { 3 }$ ​ ) can lead to significant local lattice strain and distortion, which in turn can affect oxygen vacancy formation energies and the incorporation of protons. This complexity can potentially create a diverse landscape of local environments for oxygen ions and vacancies, influencing proton hopping pathways and migration barriers. The formation of protonic defects, typically arising from the incorporation of water into oxygen vacancies  

$$
( H _ { 2 } O + V _ { O } ^ { \bullet \bullet } + O _ { O } ^ { \times }  2 O H _ { O } ^ { \bullet } ) ,
$$  

has been observed in the studied high-entropy perovskite compositions [22]. This indicates that despite the complex B-site chemistry, these materials can effectively hydrate and host protonic charge carriers. The presence of higher conductivity in humidified atmospheres compared to dry conditions, along with the observation of an isotope effect (lower conductivity with deuterium incorporation), further confirms that proton transport is the dominant conduction mechanism in these HEOs under humid conditions, similar to conventional doped proton conductors [22].  

A critical aspect is the comparison of conductivity and stability of these high-entropy zirconates to conventional single- or dual-doped barium zirconates (e.g., $B a Z r _ { 1 - x } Y _ { x } O _ { 3 - \delta } \ ,$ ). While the provided digests confirm the proton-conducting nature of several HEO compositions, they do not offer a direct quantitative comparison of conductivity values or long-term stability data against established benchmark materials like Y-doped $\mathsf { B a Z r O _ { 3 } }$ ​ [22]. However, the successful demonstration of protonic conductivity in these highly complex compositions suggests their potential as competitive proton conductors. Future research is required to systematically compare their total conductivity, proton mobility, chemical stability (especially regarding reactions with $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ or water vapor at elevated temperatures), and mechanical properties against conventional materials to fully assess their viability for practical hydrogen device applications. The unique structural and defect features arising from high entropy might offer advantages in terms of enhanced defect concentration, altered proton migration pathways, or improved tolerance to degradation in certain environments, warranting further detailed investigation.  

# 9. Device Integration and Performance Factors  

![](images/ff73a352219a66c197f5847df64b18b94fed2836dad22c72121c54a1fa2060b9.jpg)  

Efficient device integration and optimization of component properties are critical for the performance of hydrogen devices utilizing proton‐conducting zirconates [14,18]. Various fabrication techniques are employed for cell components and assembly. These include established methods like screen printing for depositing electrode layers [14] and high‐ temperature co‐sintering processes essential for achieving dense electrolyte layers and integrating support structures [3].  

Cell architectures can be free‐standing membranes, often deposited on silicon wafers but limited in thickness by mechanical stability, or supported configurations utilizing a porous matrix as a base for thin‐film growth, offering enhanced thermal shock resistance and expanded reaction interfaces [15,18]. Advanced deposition techniques such as sputtering, pulsed laser deposition (PLD), and atomic layer deposition (ALD) are also utilized for depositing thin layers or modifying surfaces, which can avoid detrimental high‐temperature reactions and improve interface quality [15]. Challenges in fabrication include achieving dense, gas‐tight electrolyte layers, particularly in supported structures where the porous substrate’s characteristics must be carefully controlled for successful thin‐film deposition [14,18].  

Electrode materials play a crucial role, requiring adequate electronic and/or ionic conductivity, thermochemical compatibility with the zirconate electrolyte, and catalytic activity [6]. Conventional anode materials in solid oxide cells are ceramic–metal composites (cermets) [25], such as NiO–BCZY [14] and Ni–BZCYYb [21], providing both electronic and protonic pathways. For cathodes, while traditional materials like LSM are used [25], research focuses on proton‐conducting compatible materials like perovskite ferrites [6] and BPHYC [21], designed as mixed ionic–electronic conductors (MIECs) [6]. A major challenge is mitigating interfacial resistance and preventing detrimental reactions like cation interdiffusion, which can form resistive layers at the electrode–electrolyte interface [6,27]. Strategies for optimizing electrode performance include tailoring composition (especially for MIECs), controlling microstructure (porosity, particle size, density, annealing) [14,15], and employing interface engineering techniques such as buffer layers (e.g., BZCY [9] or NiO‐containing layers [3]) to prevent element diffusion [3] and advanced deposition methods to improve interface quality without high‐temperature processing [15].​  

The properties of the electrolyte layer itself significantly impact device performance. Reducing electrolyte thickness substantially decreases ohmic resistance, enabling higher current densities and improved efficiency [14,18,27]. High performance has been demonstrated with thin BZY electrolytes, such as a $5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ layer achieving $1 . 2 4 \mathrm { W } \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ in PCFC mode at $6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ [3], and layers around $1 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ thickness also yielding promising results [3,21]. Beyond thickness, the electrolyte microstructure, including grain size, density, and porosity, is critical [14,18]. A dense microstructure is generally preferred for optimal proton transport, as pores and high grain boundary resistance can impede conduction [18]. Achieving high‐quality, thin electrolyte films, particularly on porous supports, requires careful control over the synthesis process and the structural characteristics of the underlying layers [18]. The quality of the electrode–electrolyte interface, specifically measured by parameters like polarization resistance, represents a significant impedance loss that must be minimized through material selection and interface engineering [27]. Overall device performance is therefore a complex interplay between fabrication methods, electrode material selection and optimization, and control over electrolyte thickness and microstructure, with the interface quality being a critical factor across these aspects [18].  

# 9.1 Electrode Materials and Interface Optimization  

Effective electrode materials are crucial for the performance and stability of devices utilizing proton‐conducting zirconate electrolytes, such as protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) and electrolyzers (PCECs). These materials must fulfill specific requirements, including adequate electronic and/or ionic conductivity, chemical and thermomechanical compatibility with the electrolyte, and catalytic activity for the relevant electrochemical reactions (hydrogen oxidation/evolution at the anode and oxygen reduction/evolution at the cathode). Conventionally, the fuel electrode in solid oxide cells is a ceramic–metal composite (cermet), where the metal facilitates electron transport and the ceramic provides pathways for oxide ions [25]. For protonic cells, cermets like NiO–BCZY [14] and Ni–BZCYYb [21] are commonly employed, combining electronic conduction from nickel with proton conduction from the zirconate. For air electrodes, traditional SOFC/SOEC materials like lanthanum strontium manganese oxide (LSM) composites [25] may not be optimally suited, prompting research into alternative materials such as perovskite ferrites [6] or materials like BPHYC [21], specifically designed for protonic conduction pathways and catalytic activity.  

A significant challenge in developing high‐performance protonic ceramic cells lies in achieving good compatibility and low interfacial resistance between the electrodes and the zirconate electrolyte [6]. Interfacial reactions, such as cation interdiffusion, can lead to the formation of resistive layers, significantly increasing the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface [27]. For example, cation interdiffusion at an Fe–BCY interface has been observed to result in an interfacial layer predominantly composed of ceria [27]. The charge transfer resistance at these interfaces constitutes a significant impedance loss, as noted for the Pt anode and Pt/BCY interface [27]. Furthermore, mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients and chemical reactions during high‐temperature sintering processes can lead to thermomechanical and chemical incompatibility issues [15].​  

Strategies for optimizing electrode performance involve careful consideration of material composition, microstructure, and interface engineering. Regarding composition, the design of mixed ionic–electronic conductors (MIECs), such as specific perovskite ferrites [6], is crucial—particularly for cathodes—to ensure efficient transport of both charge carriers (protons/oxide ions and electrons) to the reaction sites. For anodes, cermets combining electronic conductors (e.g., Ni) with proton conductors (e.g., zirconates) remain a primary approach [14,21].​  

Microstructure optimization is equally vital. This includes designing appropriate porous structures to facilitate gas transport to the reaction zone [15], controlling particle size, potentially using nanostructured or nanosized materials to increase the electrochemically active surface area [15], and optimizing the density and distribution of components within composite electrodes like cermets [14,15]. Annealing procedures are also utilized to refine the electrode architecture [15].  

Interface engineering is critical for minimizing interfacial resistance and preventing detrimental reactions. This can involve employing buffer layers between the electrode and electrolyte. For instance, NiO has been incorporated into support and buffer layers (BCZY+NiO and BZY+NiO) [3], and a BZCY interlayer has been used to optimize the interface [9]. Such buffer layers are designed to prevent the diffusion of elements, such as the diffusion of Ce into the BZY electrolyte layer [3], which can degrade performance. Furthermore, advanced deposition techniques—such as sputtering, pulsed laser deposition (PLD), and atomic layer deposition (ALD)—can be employed to deposit electrodes or interlayers without the need for high temperature sintering, thereby mitigating thermomechanical and chemical incompatibility issues [15]. ALD is also particularly useful for modifying the surface of catalysts within electrodes, enhancing their catalytic activity [15]. Addressing the charge transfer kinetics at these interfaces is fundamental to reducing the overall cell impedance [27].  

# 9.2 Electrolyte Thickness and Microstructure Effects  

Electrolyte thickness is a critical parameter that significantly influences the performance of proton‐conducting solid oxide cells [14]. A primary effect of reducing electrolyte thickness is the substantial decrease in ohmic resistance [18]. This reduction in resistance directly contributes to improved device efficiency and enables operation at higher current densities [14].​  

Experimental results underscore the benefits of utilizing thin electrolytes. For example, a proton‐conducting fuel cell (PCFC) employing a $5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ thick $\mathrm { B a Z r _ { 0 . 8 } Y _ { 0 . 2 } O _ { 3 - \delta } }$ ​ (BZY) electrolyte achieved a peak power density of $1 . 2 4 \mathsf { W } \mathsf { c m } \big | \big | ^ { 2 }$ at $6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ , while in proton‐conducting electrolysis cell (PCEC) mode, it reached a current density of $- 2 . 3 3 \mathsf { A c m } \bigotimes ^ { 2 }$ at $\displaystyle { 1 . 3 \vee } .$ . This performance represents a 2–3 fold improvement compared to previously reported Zr‐based cells [3].  

High performance was also observed with slightly thicker electrolytes. For example, a $9 \mu \mathrm { m }$ BZY layer in a $5 0 \times 5 0 \mathsf { m m } ^ { 2 }$ cell demonstrated a peak PCFC power density of $0 . 8 4 \mathsf { W } \mathsf { c m } \big \boxtimes ^ { 2 }$ [3]. Other studies have also utilized electrolytes with thicknesses around $1 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ [21].​  

Beyond thickness, the microstructure of the electrolyte layer profoundly impacts proton transport and overall device performance [14]. Key microstructural attributes include grain size and porosity [18]. A denser electrolyte layer is generally conducive to improved proton transport [14]. Pores or significant grain boundary resistance can impede proton conduction, affecting both bulk and grain boundary pathways. Therefore, controlling porosity and grain size is essential for optimizing conductivity.​  

For supported electrolyte configurations, achieving a high-quality, thin-film electrolyte necessitates careful consideration of the underlying porous electrode’s surface topography, particle size, and pore structure during synthesis [18]. This highlights the interdependent relationship between electrode characteristics and the ability to fabricate dense, thin, and well-performing electrolyte layers.

Proton-conducting zirconates have emerged as critical materials for various hydrogen-related technologies, owing to their high proton conductivity and favorable thermomechanical properties under relevant operating conditions [16]. This section provides a comprehensive review of the fundamental operating principles, performance characteristics, challenges, and advantages of utilizing zirconate-based materials in different hydrogen devices. The applications discussed span a range of electrochemical and catalytic systems, including Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells (PCFCs), Protonic Ceramic Electrolysis Cells (PCECs), hydrogen separation membranes, hydrogen sensors, hydrogen pumps, and catalytic reactors [1,5,12,30]. These diverse applications underscore the versatility of proton-conducting zirconates in the broader context of hydrogen production, utilization, and processing [5,12,16,25].  

The performance of zirconate-based devices is typically assessed through metrics such as efficiency, power or current density, operating temperature range, and long-term stability under relevant operating environments [3,14]. Zirconates, particularly doped barium zirconates (BZY), offer advantages like enhanced stability compared to cerate-based proton conductors, which is crucial for demanding applications like electrolysis under high steam concentrations [16,18,27]. However, challenges specific to each application, such as electrode kinetics in fuel cells and electrolyzers, or permeability and selectivity requirements in membranes, must be addressed for practical implementation [5,27]. Furthermore, emerging applications like hydrogen pumps and their performance evaluation, or the role of zirconates as catalyst supports in hightemperature reactions, are explored, highlighting the expanding scope of proton-conducting zirconates beyond traditional fuel cells and electrolyzers [14,30]. The following sub-sections detail the principles and performance of zirconate-based materials within these specific device categories.  

# 10.1 Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells (PCFCs)  

Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells (PCFCs), utilizing proton-conducting electrolytes such as doped zirconates, represent a promising alternative to traditional oxide‐ion conducting solid oxide fuel cells (O‑SOFCs). A key advantage of PCFCs operating with hydrogen–oxygen fuel is the production of water at the cathode, which prevents fuel dilution and potentially simplifies system design compared to O‑SOFCs where water forms at the anode [16]. Significant research efforts are dedicated to developing high‐performance PCFCs based on barium zirconate–based proton conductors [11].  

The performance of zirconate‐based PCFCs is typically evaluated by their power density output under various operating conditions. For example, a barium zirconate (BZY‑15) cell demonstrated a peak power density of  

$0 . 6 0 \mathrm { W ~ c m } ^ { - 2 }$ at $6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ when operated in PCFC mode [3]. Reducing the thickness of the BZY electrolyte layer to $5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ allowed the peak power density to increase substantially to  

$1 . 2 4 \mathrm { W ~ c m } ^ { - 2 }$ at $6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ [3]. Even a larger cell ( $\mathrm { 5 0 \times 5 0 m m ^ { 2 } }$ ) with a slightly thicker ${ \mathfrak { g } } _ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ electrolyte achieved a respectable peak power density of  

$0 . 8 4 \mathrm { W ~ c m ^ { - 2 } }$ [3]. These results highlight the potential of thin‐electrolyte designs to mitigate ohmic losses and enhance power output in zirconate‐based PCFCs.  

Operating temperature also plays a critical role in determining PCFC performance. Higher temperatures generally lead to improved kinetics and higher power densities. In various PCFC configurations (though not always explicitly stated as zirconate‐based in every case), peak power densities of  

​1.37 0.96 , and $0 . 6 2 \mathrm { W ~ c m } ^ { - 2 }$ were recorded at $6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , $5 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , and $5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , respectively, using hydrogen fuel and air as the oxidant [21]. Some materials tested as cathodes in PCFCs have shown promising performance even at intermediate temperatures, achieving peak power densities like  

$0 . 6 7 \mathrm { W ~ c m ^ { - 2 } }$ at $5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ [6]. The investigation into alternative electrolytes like $\mathsf { C e O } _ { 2 } / \mathsf { C e O } _ { 2 } { - } \delta$ demonstrates the potentia for achieving promising PCFC performance at temperatures as low as  

$5 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ [9], suggesting a trend towards lower operating temperatures compared to traditional high‑temperature SOFCs while maintaining reasonable performance. The typical fuel composition for testing these PCFCs is hydrogen, supplied with air as the oxidant [21].  

Current challenges in PCFC development, including those based on zirconate electrolytes, primarily stem from limitations in electrode kinetics and interfacial resistance [5]. Poor oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode and high interfacial resistance between the electrolyte and electrodes can significantly impede overall cell performance, particularly at lower intermediate temperatures. Furthermore, developing stable and efficient electrode materials compatible with zirconate electrolytes remains crucial.​  

Improvement strategies focus on addressing these limitations. Optimization of electrode composition and microstructure is key, such as developing synergistic three‑phase air electrodes to enhance reaction rates [21] or exploring new cathode materials like cobalt‑free perovskite ferrites [6]. Reducing electrolyte thickness, as demonstrated with the BZY cells, is a direct way to lower ohmic resistance [3]. Strategies involving surface modifications or utilizing surface protonic conduction in porous structures are also being explored, particularly for lower‑temperature operation [5]. While tubular cell designs for PCFCs are established, development is progressing towards planar stack architectures for scalability and potentially higher power density [5]. Continued advancements in material synthesis, cell fabrication techniques, and the understanding of interfacial phenomena are essential for further enhancing the performance and durability of zirconate‐based PCFCs.  

# 10.2 Protonic Ceramic Electrolysis Cells (PCECs)  

Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) represent a promising technology for efficient hydrogen or syngas production, particularly attractive for applications in green hydrogen generation [25]. The use of proton‐conducting electrolytes, such as doped zirconates, offers distinct advantages in steam electrolysis (P-SOECs). In this configuration, steam is supplied to the anode, where it is split into protons and oxygen. Protons are then transported through the electrolyte to the cathode, where they are reduced to hydrogen, effectively separating the hydrogen product from residual steam [16]. This direct separation simplifies downstream processing compared to systems relying on oxygen ion transport. PCECs typically operate at intermediate temperatures, often within the range of $4 5 0 – 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ [18].  

Performance metrics for zirconate‐based PCECs demonstrate their potential for high hydrogen production rates. For instance, a BZY-15 cell achieved a current density of $- 1 . 1 4 \mathrm { A ~ c m } ^ { - 2 }$ at an applied voltage of $ { 1 . 3 \vee }$ in PCEC mode [3]. Utilizing a thinner electrolyte significantly boosts performance; a cell with a $5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ thick BZY electrolyte reached a current density of $- 2 . 3 3 \mathrm { A ~ c m } ^ { - 2 }$ at 1.3 V [3]. Under conditions of 0.7 atm steam pressure, a Faradaic efficiency of $7 9 \%$ was reported at a current density of $- 2 \mathrm { A } \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ , corresponding to a hydrogen production rate of $\boldsymbol { 1 1 . 7 9 } \ : \mathrm { m l } \ : \mathrm { m i n } \forall ^ { 1 } \ : \mathrm { c m } \forall ^ { 2 }$ [3]. Pushing the current density further to $- 4 \mathrm { A } \ \mathrm { c m } ^ { - 2 }$ at 0.7 atm steam with the $5 \mu \mathrm { m }$ BZY electrolyte resulted in a hydrogen production rate of $1 9 . 6 2 \mathsf { m l } \mathsf { m i n } \mathsf { \nabla } \mathsf { U } ^ { 1 } \mathsf { c m } \mathsf { \nabla } \mathsf { U } ^ { 2 }$ [3]. Another example demonstrated an electrolysis current density of $2 . 4 0 \mathsf { A c m } \mathsf { B } ^ { 2 }$ at an applied voltage of $1 . 3 \lor$ at $6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ [21].​  

Maintaining stability under harsh electrolysis conditions, particularly high steam partial pressures and high current densities, remains a critical challenge for PCEC components [10,27]. The demands of high current operation, as seen in related electrolysis technologies demonstrating stable operation of catalysts at ampere levels for extended periods [10], underscore the need for robust electrode and electrolyte materials in PCECs operating under industrial-relevant conditions.  

Beyond hydrogen and syngas production, PCECs are being explored for novel electrochemical applications, such as electrochemically promoted ammonia synthesis [27]. In such systems, performance can be evaluated based on metrics including the ammonia formation rate $( r _ { N H _ { 3 } }$ ) and current density $\left( \dot { \ i } _ { c } \right)$ , typically normalized by the electrode area [27].  

Efficiency metrics like Faradaic efficiency (FE) and electrical energy efficiency are defined by specific formulas. The Faradaic efficiency is given by:  

$$
F E = \frac { r _ { N H _ { 3 } } i _ { c } } { n F }
$$  

where $n$ is the number of electrons involved and $F$ is the Faraday constant [27]. The electrical energy efficiency is calculated as:  

$$
\mathrm { E l e c t r i c a l \ e n e r g y \ e f f i c i e n c y } = { \frac { r _ { N H _ { 3 } } i _ { c } V M _ { N H _ { 3 } } } { L H V _ { N H _ { 3 } } } }
$$  

where $V$ is the applied voltage, $M _ { N H _ { 3 } }$ ​ is the molar mass of $N H _ { 3 }$ ​ , and $L H V _ { N H _ { 3 } }$ ​​ is the lower heating value of $N H _ { 3 }$ ​ [27]. Using a Ni-BZY | BCY | Fe cell configuration, a high ammonia formation rate of $1 . 1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 8 } \mathrm { m o l s ^ { - 1 } c m ^ { - 2 } }$ was achieved at $- 1 . 2 5 \mathrm { V }$ , representing a significant 10-fold enhancement compared to operation at open circuit voltage (OCV) [27]. Notably, the ammonia formation rate exhibited an exponential, non-Faradaic increase at low applied voltages [27]. These studies highlight the versatility of proton‐conducting zirconate‐based cells for diverse electrochemical processes beyond conventional hydrogen production.  

# 10.3 Hydrogen Separation Membranes  

The development of efficient hydrogen separation membranes is crucial for various industrial applications, including hydrogen purification and fuel processing. Proton-conducting ceramic materials, particularly those based on zirconates, represent promising candidates for such membranes due to their ability to selectively transport hydrogen in the form of protons at elevated temperatures. Evaluating the feasibility of using zirconate membranes for hydrogen separation requires comprehensive analysis of their performance characteristics, including permeation flux and selectivity. Hydrogen permeation testing is a fundamental experimental technique employed to assess these properties and understand the transport mechanisms involved [6]. Such tests are routinely performed in research exploring proton-conducting materials for various hydrogen-related technologies, underscoring their relevance to membrane applications [6]. A thorough assessment of zirconate membranes for hydrogen separation would necessitate detailed data on hydrogen permeation rates, factors influencing permeation flux and selectivity (such as membrane thickness, microstructure, and surface exchange kinetics), and performance comparisons against established membrane materials. However, the provided information primarily indicates the execution of hydrogen permeation tests [6] without offering specific quantitative data or analysis pertaining to zirconate membrane performance, the impact of material characteristics on permeation, or comparative studies. Therefore, a complete evaluation of the feasibility of zirconate membranes based on the provided material is limited, highlighting the need for further detailed investigations into their specific permeation properties and operational parameters.​  

# 10.4 Hydrogen Sensors  

Proton-conducting zirconates, such as $C a Z r _ { 0 . 9 } I n _ { 0 . 1 } O _ { 3 - \alpha }$ , have been explored for applications as solid electrolytes in hydrogen sensors [16]. The utilization of a proton conductor as a solid electrolyte typically underpins an electrochemical sensing mechanism, commonly potentiometric, where a potential difference is generated across the electrolyte membrane in response to a hydrogen concentration gradient. This potential is directly related to the partial pressure of hydrogen, allowing for its detection and quantification. While detailed sensor performance characteristics such as sensitivity, response time, and selectivity are not provided, the choice of zirconate-based materials like $C a Z r _ { 0 . 9 } I n _ { 0 . 1 } O _ { 3 - \alpha }$ is motivated by their favorable properties [16]. Compared to cerate-based proton conductors, zirconates exhibit superior mechanical strength and chemical stability, which are crucial for robust and long-term sensor operation in potentially demanding environments [16]. These enhanced physical and chemical properties contribute to the reliability and durability of zirconate-based solid electrolytes in hydrogen sensing devices.​  

# 10.5 Hydrogen Pumps  

Proton-conducting solid oxide cells (P-SOCs) based on zirconates are being investigated for various hydrogen‐related applications, including their potential operation as hydrogen pumps. Functioning as electrochemical devices, these pumps utilize the proton conductivity of the electrolyte to transport hydrogen ions under an applied electrical potential, facilitating hydrogen separation or compression. An electrode-supported P-SOC device was specifically evaluated in this capacity, demonstrating functional performance in the intermediate temperature range [14].  

During testing, this device achieved current densities ranging from 150 to $5 2 5 \mathsf { m A c m } \bigotimes ^ { 2 }$ under an applied voltage of 1 V, within the temperature window of $3 5 0 { \mathrm { - } } 4 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ [14]. This performance evaluation highlights the feasibility of employing zirconate-based proton conductors in electrochemical hydrogen pumping applications at moderate temperatures.​  

# 10.6 R-PSOCs and Air Electrodes  

The development of efficient air electrodes is critical for the performance of reversible proton-conducting solid oxide cells (R-PSOCs), particularly those employing proton-conducting zirconates as electrolytes. While traditional solid oxide cells often rely on oxygen‐ion conductors, R-PSOCs require electrode materials compatible with proton transport. This often involves triple-phase boundaries (TPBs) where the gas, electrode, and electrolyte phases converge. Research has explored multi-phase electrode compositions to optimize electrochemical activity. One such approach employs triple-conducting air electrodes, as exemplified by the BPHYC system, which has been investigated for its application in R-PSOCs [21].  

The BPHYC electrode is designed as a composite structure comprising three distinct phases—BYC (presumably a Barium Yttrium Cerate or a cerate-zirconate derivative), PBC, and BHY (likely Barium Hafnium Yttrium oxide or a similar compound) [21]. The rationale behind this multi-phase composition is to achieve a synergistic effect among the constituent materials [21], which is reported to significantly enhance the overall performance of the air electrode when integrated into R-PSOCs [21]. The presence of multiple phases is intended to provide diverse pathways for oxygen reduction (in fuel cell mode) and oxygen evolution (in electrolysis mode), potentially improving charge transfer and reaction kinetics at the electrode– electrolyte interface by maximizing active sites at the TPBs or by extending reaction zones through enhanced bulk conductivity.​  

However, the information provided primarily details the compositional approach and the reported synergistic benefits for performance enhancement in R-PSOCs [21]. Details regarding quantitative performance metrics, a direct comparison of the advantages of this proton-compatible electrode system over traditional air electrodes designed for oxygen-ion conductors, and an in-depth evaluation of the electrode's stability under the distinct operational conditions of fuel cell and electrolysis modes are not fully elaborated. Further research is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the long-term viability and practical implementation of such multi-phase zirconate-related composite electrodes in R-PSOC technology.  

# 10.7 Catalytic Applications  

Proton-conducting zirconates and related perovskites are being explored for their potential roles in catalytic applications, particularly as catalyst supports in gas‐phase reactions. Their unique proton conductivity properties may influence catalyst performance and stability by affecting surface chemistry or reaction pathways [30]. A prominent example is their use as supports for active metal phases in reactions like ethane dehydrogenation [30].  

Studies have investigated barium zirconate $( \mathsf { B a Z r O _ { 3 } }$ , BZ) and barium cerate (BaCeO​3​ , BC) perovskites as supports for chromium (Cr) catalysts in the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene [30]. The findings indicate that Cr catalysts supported on these proton‐conducting perovskites exhibit significantly higher activity compared to catalysts supported on conventional materials like $\gamma { \mathrm { - A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } } }$ ​ [30]. Comparing the two perovskite supports, $C r / \mathsf { B } Z$ demonstrated a higher ethylene formation rate of $1 . 4 \times 1 0 ^ { - 7 } \mathrm { ~ m o l / m } ^ { 2 }$ s at $5 7 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ , which is more than double the rate observed for Cr/BC ( $6 . 2 \times { { 1 0 } ^ { - 8 } }$ $\mathsf { m o l / m } ^ { 2 }$ s at the same temperature) [30]. Despite the difference in activity, both $C r / \mathsf { B } Z$ and $\mathsf { C r / B C }$ catalysts maintained high selectivity towards ethylene, consistently above $9 4 \%$ within the temperature range of $4 7 5 - 5 7 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ [30].​  

Analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provided insights into the surface species present on the catalysts. A higher initial concentration of $C r ^ { 6 + }$ was detected on the $\mathsf { C r / B C }$ catalyst compared to $C r / \mathsf { B } Z$ [30]. This presence of $C r ^ { 6 + }$ was suggested to contribute to the initial activity, potentially by facilitating the oxidation of surface carbon species [30]. Furthermore, reaction parameters such as residence time were found to influence product distribution and carbon deposition. Decreasing the residence time led to an increased concentration of ethylene in the product stream while simultaneously reducing the formation of undesirable carbon deposits on the catalyst surface [30]. These results highlight the potential of proton‐conducting perovskites, including zirconates like $\mathsf { B a Z r O _ { 3 } }$ ​ , to serve as effective supports in high‐ temperature catalytic processes, influencing both activity and stability through their interaction with the active phase and potentially their proton conductivity.​  

# 11. Critical Materials and Recycling  

The widespread development and deployment of proton-conducting zirconates in hydrogen technologies necessitate a critical examination of the materials involved, particularly concerning the reliance on elements deemed critical raw materials. Solid oxide cells (SOCs), which share material challenges with other high-temperature electrochemical devices like those employing proton-conducting zirconates, often utilize materials that incorporate rare earth elements (REEs) such as lanthanum, strontium, gadolinium, cerium, and yttrium [25].  

Beyond REEs, a range of other metals—including nickel, cobalt, zirconium, magnesium, manganese, lithium, molybdenum, hafnium, gallium, platinum-group elements, scandium, titanium, and selenium—are also classified as critical raw materials due to their economic significance, increasing demand across various industries, and potential supply risks [25]. Zirconatebased materials, by definition, involve zirconium, which is explicitly identified as a critical raw material [25]. The dependence on such materials presents considerable environmental and economic implications. Environmentally, the extraction and processing of these critical metals can result in significant habitat disruption, energy consumption, and generation of hazardous waste. Economically, their limited availability and geopolitical factors can lead to price volatility and supply chain vulnerabilities, potentially hindering the cost-effectiveness and scalability of zirconate-based technologies.  

Addressing these challenges requires the development of effective recycling strategies and the exploration of more sustainable material alternatives. While dedicated recycling processes for spent zirconate-based devices are still in nascent stages, insights can be drawn from techniques developed for recovering metals from other complex waste streams. For instance, methods used for metal recovery from electronic waste (e-waste), optical waste, and coal fly ash are being explored for their potential applicability to recovering critical metals from spent SOCs [25]. These techniques, which may involve hydrometallurgical, pyrometallurgical, or bio-metallurgical approaches, offer potential pathways for extracting valuable elements from decommissioned zirconate-based devices, thereby reducing the need for primary extraction and mitigating associated environmental impacts.  

The long-term viability and sustainability of proton-conducting zirconate technology are intrinsically linked to minimizing reliance on critical materials and establishing robust end-of-life management strategies. Prioritizing the research and development of materials with lower criticality profiles and investing in efficient, economically viable recycling processes are crucial steps towards ensuring the sustainable deployment of these promising hydrogen technologies.

Despite significant advancements, the widespread practical application of proton‐conducting zirconates in hydrogen devices is hindered by several key technical challenges that impact performance, durability, and economic viability [15]. A fundamental challenge lies in achieving sufficiently high proton conductivity, particularly below $5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ , which necessitates a deeper understanding and manipulation of the intricate interaction between proton motion and the crystal lattice structure [23]. The intrinsic material properties, such as crystal symmetry, play a crucial role; for instance, hexagonal structures exhibit significantly lower proton conductivity compared to cubic counterparts due to differences in proton sites and hydrogen bonding [26].  

Processing presents a major hurdle, primarily the prohibitively high sintering temperatures required for densifying zirconate electrolytes like $B a Z r _ { 0 . 8 } Y _ { 0 . 2 } O _ { 3 }$ ​ , typically exceeding $1 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ [3,15,18]. High sintering temperatures complicate integration with other cell components and increase manufacturing costs. Furthermore, grain boundary blocking effects substantially reduce the total proton conductivity in polycrystalline $B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ​ and related materials, limiting device efficiency [15]. Manufacturing processes for thin-film electrolytes face specific issues like pinhole formation and challenges in scaling up techniques such as Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) [18].  

Material stability under demanding operating environments is another critical concern. High-partial-pressure steam, particularly prevalent in Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOECs), accelerates material degradation, compromising long-term durability [15,18]. Mechanical and thermal compatibility issues, including inadequate damage tolerance and thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) mismatch between rare earth zirconates and other stack materials, can lead to delamination and failure [28].  

Challenges also extend to electrodes and the overall device architecture. Achieving adequate electrode fabrication with sufficient porosity and optimized electrode/electrolyte interfaces is crucial for efficient charge transfer kinetics [27]. Electrode materials must demonstrate high catalytic activity, stability, and cost-effectiveness [5,12,19]. The high cost and scarcity of Pt-based catalysts hinder commercialization [19]. Current cobalt-based cathode materials suffer from instability, poor compatibility, high cost, and suboptimal performance, necessitating research into alternatives [6]. Furthermore, carbon deposition can deactivate catalysts, posing a challenge, particularly in hydrocarbon-fueled anodes [30]. The complexity of optimizing proton-conducting solid oxide cells (P-SOCs) requires multifront efforts across material synthesis and fabrication [14].​  

Addressing these challenges requires focused future research across multiple domains. Exploration of novel material chemistries and crystal structures is crucial, including identifying alternative materials to reduce reliance on critical elements [25] and designing new perovskite proton conductors, including cobalt-free cathodes [6,32]. Investigating surface proton conduction mechanisms, as observed in ceria, offers potential new pathways for efficient low-temperature transport in various materials [9]. Developing high-performance Platinum Group Metal (PGM)-free catalysts is vital for cost reduction and stability [19]. Beyond zirconates, exploring frameworks like COFs for enhanced proton conductivity and stability is a promising direction [8].​  

Optimizing existing materials, components, and interfaces is equally important. This includes continuous efforts in electrode material optimization and interface engineering to enhance performance and stability [3]. Developing active electrodes with low polarization resistance is essential, particularly for enabling lower operating temperatures [18]. Advanced fabrication techniques, such as co-sintering to lower processing temperatures [3] and in-situ exsolution for nanoparticle-decorated electrodes [15], are critical research areas. New ceramic membrane preparation techniques are needed for optimized electrolyte structures [32]. Tailoring material modifications and optimizing fabrication for specific environmental conditions, including those with steam and carbon dioxide, is necessary [14].  

A deeper mechanistic understanding, supported by sophisticated characterization and computational modeling, is paramount for rational material design. Techniques like single crystal neutron diffuse scattering can provide insights into structural disorder relevant to transport [17]. Isotopic mixing and in-situ spectroscopic methods are necessary to elucidate reaction mechanisms at interfaces [27]. Fundamental studies correlating dopants, proton dynamics, and lattice vibrations are key to optimizing conduction [23]. Finally, scaling up promising catalysts and optimizing preparation processes and device integration schemes are crucial for the large-scale deployment of these technologies, for example, in green hydrogen production [10]. Continued progress relies on interdisciplinary collaboration and leveraging advanced computational tools to accelerate material discovery and device optimization.  

# 12.1 Technical Challenges  

Despite significant progress, several technical challenges impede the widespread practical application of proton-conducting zirconates in hydrogen devices. These limitations directly impact device performance, durability, and economic viability [15]. A fundamental challenge lies in understanding and manipulating the intricate interaction between proton motion and the crystal lattice structure to enhance proton conductivity [23]. This intrinsic material property is crucial, as demonstrated by the finding that proton conductivity in hexagonal materials is at least two orders of magnitude lower than in cubic counterparts [26].  

A major processing hurdle is the prohibitively high sintering temperature required for dense zirconate electrolytes, such as $B a Z r _ { 0 . 8 } Y _ { 0 . 2 } O _ { 3 }$ ​ which typically needs temperatures around $1 6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ [3,15,18]. Such high temperatures complicate integration with other cell components and contribute to increased fabrication costs. Furthermore, grain boundary blocking effects significantly hinder the total proton conductivity of polycrystalline $B a Z r O _ { 3 }$ ​ and related materials, reducing overall device efficiency [15].​  

Mechanical and thermal compatibility issues also pose considerable challenges. Rare earth zirconates, often considered for applications like thermal barrier coatings, suffer from inadequate damage tolerance and a mismatch in thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) with other materials in a stack, potentially leading to delamination and failure [28]. Material degradation under harsh operating environments, particularly in the presence of high-partial-pressure steam in solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOECs), can compromise long-term durability [18].​  

Beyond the electrolyte, challenges extend to electrodes and overall device architecture. Inadequate electrode fabrication, such as failing to maintain sufficient porosity at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, can limit charge transfer kinetics [27]. Electrode materials themselves face challenges regarding catalytic activity, stability, and cost [12,19]. For instance, the commercialization of Pt-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is hindered by their high cost and scarcity [19]. Current cobalt-based cathode materials, while investigated, present issues with phase instability, poor thermal compatibility, high cost, and insufficient performance [6]. Additionally, carbon deposition leading to catalyst deactivation is a significant technical hurdle, particularly in fuel cell anodes operating with hydrocarbon fuels [30].  

From a manufacturing perspective, the development of proton-conducting solid oxide cells (P-SOCs) requires complex, multifront optimization across material synthesis and fabrication procedures [14]. Specific thin-film fabrication challenges include pinhole formation, difficulties in scaling up techniques like Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD), and ensuring material quality over large areas [18]. Finally, translating novel proton conduction mechanisms, such as the surface conduction observed in ceria, to optimize performance in other material systems presents another avenue requiring extensive research and development [9]. Collectively, these material-specific, processing, and system-level challenges necessitate continued research efforts to enable the widespread and reliable implementation of zirconate-based proton conductors in energy devices.​  

# 12.2 Future Research Areas  

Future research in proton-conducting zirconates for hydrogen devices presents promising avenues to address current limitations and enhance performance, stability, and cost-effectiveness. A significant focus lies in the exploration of novel material chemistries and structures. This includes identifying alternative materials to reduce dependency on critical elements [25]. Specific material design strategies involve exploring novel perovskite proton conductors and modifying the structure of traditional perovskite electrolytes [32]. Rational design of cobalt-free perovskites is also suggested as a direction for optimizing cathode materials [6]. For electrolytes, the continued exploration of new materials exhibiting high protonic conductivity, particularly to enable lower operating temperatures, is crucial [18]. Furthermore, investigating surface proton conduction mechanisms and their application in other energy materials could unlock new pathways for efficient proton transport [9]. Catalyst development remains vital, with directions pointing towards the design of highperformance platinum group metal (PGM)-free catalysts, such as Co- and Mn-N-C variants, to mitigate issues like Fenton reactions [19]. While not exclusively zirconates, the potential of optimizing the structure and functionalization of materials like COFs for enhanced proton conductivity and stability highlights the broader scope for exploring porous frameworks in proton conduction applications [8].​  

Beyond novel materials, optimizing existing materials, components, and interfaces is critical. Research should continue to focus on electrode material optimization and interface engineering to improve the overall performance and stability of proton ceramic batteries and other electrochemical devices [3]. Developing active electrodes with low polarization resistance is essential, particularly for enabling lower temperature operation [18]. Optimizing catalyst composition and operating conditions is necessary, for instance, to minimize carbon formation while maintaining high activity and selectivity in catalytic applications [30]. Advanced fabrication techniques, such as in-situ exsolution for manufacturing nanoparticledecorated electrodes, represent a promising route, although expanding the range of suitable substrates beyond conventional perovskite oxides is needed [15]. Developing new ceramic membrane preparation techniques will also be important for fabricating optimized electrolyte structures [32]. Tailoring material modifications and using appropriate screen-printed electrodes can lead to efficient proton-conducting solid oxide cells suitable for various energy storage or conversion reactions in diverse environments, including those containing steam and carbon dioxide [14].  

Deeper mechanistic understanding, guided by advanced characterization and computational methods, is paramount to rational material design. Techniques such as single crystal neutron diffuse scattering can provide insights into positional disorder and structural states, potentially explaining transport properties [17]. Isotopic mixing and in situ spectroscopic methods, such as infrared spectroscopy, are necessary for elucidating reaction mechanisms and identifying intermediates [27]. Fundamental studies exploring the intricate relationship between dopants, proton dynamics, and lattice vibrations are essential for optimizing proton conduction in barium zirconate and related materials [23]. Finally, scaling up promising catalysts and optimizing preparation processes and device integration schemes are crucial steps to facilitate the large-scale deployment of these technologies for applications like green hydrogen production [10].  

# 13. Conclusion  

This review has surveyed the significant advancements in understanding and developing proton-conducting zirconates, particularly acceptor-doped barium zirconates ( $\mathrm { \Delta B a Z r O _ { 3 } }$ ), highlighting their increasing importance as key materials for future hydrogen technologies. Substantial progress has been made in improving their proton conductivity, chemical stability, and processability, driven by insights into proton transport mechanisms [26] and structural engineering [3,18]. Breakthroughs in overcoming challenges such as the high sintering temperature of $\mathrm { { B a Z r O _ { 3 } } }$ ​ -based electrolytes through structural innovation and process optimization have enabled the fabrication of high-performance proton ceramic batteries (PCBs) [3]. Novel material concepts, such as high entropy oxides based on barium zirconate, have demonstrated proton conductivity, suggesting new avenues for compositional design [20,22]. Beyond traditional perovskites, research continues into alternative solid oxide proton conductors, exploring diverse crystal structures and surface phenomena, including the surface-confined superprotonic conductivity observed in core-shell structures, which shows promise for low-temperature applications [2,9,13].​  

The demonstrated capabilities of proton-conducting zirconates underscore their immense potential across a range of hydrogen-related devices. They are promising candidates for electrolytes in proton ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) and proton ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs), operating efficiently in the intermediate temperature range [5,12,32]. High-performance cells, including electrode-supported configurations, have been successfully fabricated and evaluated for applications such as hydrogen pumps [14] and electrochemical synthesis of ammonia, achieving notable reaction rates [27]. Furthermore, these materials show potential as catalyst supports in reactions like ethane dehydrogenation, offering higher activity compared to traditional supports [30]. The development of highly active and stable air electrodes, such as those employing synergistic multi-phase compositions based on acceptor-doped barium cerate and zirconate, has also significantly contributed to enhancing device performance and stability in both fuel cell and electrolysis modes [21]. The use of ultra-thin electrolytes has been identified as a reliable technology path for improving performance in green hydrogen production and electrochemical synthesis systems [3].  

Despite the significant progress, several critical challenges must be addressed to fully realize the potential of protonconducting zirconates. Key limitations include improving the conductivity of Zr-based ceramics while maintaining high chemical stability, particularly compared to Ce-based counterparts which face stability issues [32]. Materials challenges persist regarding achieving simultaneously high proton conductivity, suitable thermal expansion compatibility with other cell components, and optimized electrode kinetics [5,12]. Achieving dense electrolyte layers, especially in electrodesupported structures or when using thin-film deposition techniques, remains crucial for gas-tightness and device performance [14]. Furthermore, understanding and mitigating factors that reduce conductivity, such as unfavorable proton sites in lower symmetry structures [26] or issues like carbon deposition in catalytic applications [30], require further investigation. Lowering the operating temperature of solid oxide cells (SOCs) while maintaining performance is a continuous challenge, necessitating further optimization of cell structure and electrolyte material design, including doping strategies and exploration of thin-film and nanostructured electrodes [15,18].  

Continued research efforts are thus imperative. Future work should focus on rational material design, exploring novel compositions and crystal structures beyond conventional perovskites [2,13,32]. Advanced characterization techniques are needed to further elucidate proton transport mechanisms, including the role of proton-lattice interactions [23] and surface effects [5,9]. Developing facile and cost-effective preparation techniques for dense electrolytes and high-performance electrodes is essential for scaling up these technologies [14,32]. Furthermore, long-term stability under realistic operating conditions, including high steam partial pressures and current densities, needs continuous assessment and improvement [3,21]. Addressing these challenges through integrated approaches combining materials science, electrochemistry, and engineering will be key to fully unlock the potential of proton-conducting zirconates and contribute to a sustainable energy future through efficient hydrogen technologies.
