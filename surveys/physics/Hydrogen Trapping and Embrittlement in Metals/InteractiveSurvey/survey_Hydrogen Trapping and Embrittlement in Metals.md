# 2 Introduction
Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is a critical issue in the field of materials science, particularly in the context of metals and alloys used in high-stress and hydrogen-rich environments [1]. The phenomenon, characterized by the degradation of mechanical properties due to the presence of hydrogen, poses significant challenges in industries ranging from aerospace and automotive to energy and manufacturing. Hydrogen, when introduced into a metal, can diffuse through the lattice, leading to the formation of hydrogen traps at various microstructural features such as grain boundaries, dislocations, and precipitates [2]. These traps can accumulate hydrogen, leading to localized regions of high hydrogen concentration that can significantly reduce the material's ductility and fracture toughness. Understanding the mechanisms of hydrogen trapping and embrittlement is essential for developing materials that can withstand hydrogen exposure without compromising their mechanical integrity [1].

This survey paper focuses on the multifaceted aspects of hydrogen trapping and embrittlement in metals, encompassing both experimental and theoretical approaches [3]. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge in this field, highlighting recent advancements and identifying key areas for future research. The survey covers a broad spectrum of topics, including advanced spectroscopic techniques, quantum modeling, microstructural analysis, multiphysics modeling, and the integration of experimental validation with theoretical predictions. By synthesizing insights from these diverse areas, the paper seeks to advance the understanding of hydrogen embrittlement and guide the development of more resilient materials for hydrogen-related applications [3].

The paper begins by delving into advanced spectroscopic techniques and quantum modeling, which are crucial for understanding the fundamental properties of materials and the behavior of hydrogen at the atomic level. Quantum properties of matter, particularly in ultracold atomic systems, are discussed, with a focus on superfluidity and its relevance to the study of hydrogen in metals. The paper then explores the electronic and optical properties of complex systems, such as metal halide perovskites, and the role of light-matter interactions in these materials [4]. These sections provide a foundational understanding of the physical principles that underpin hydrogen trapping and embrittlement [3].

Next, the paper examines experimental techniques and characterization methods that are essential for probing the microstructural and chemical properties of materials. Techniques such as thermal desorption spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography are discussed in detail, highlighting their contributions to the understanding of hydrogen diffusion, trapping, and the formation of hydrides. The paper also covers advanced imaging and manipulation techniques, including scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy and X-ray diffraction, which offer high-resolution insights into the distribution of hydrogen at grain boundaries and dislocations.

The paper then transitions to multiphysics and phase field modeling, which are critical for simulating the complex interactions between hydrogen and the microstructure of metals. The sections on hydrogen transport and stress concentrators, fracture mechanics, and kinetic and equilibrium trapping models provide a comprehensive framework for predicting and mitigating hydrogen embrittlement [5]. These models integrate macroscopic and mesoscale approaches to capture the intricate dynamics of hydrogen diffusion, trapping, and the resultant mechanical degradation [1].

Finally, the paper discusses the contributions of this survey to the field of hydrogen embrittlement research. By synthesizing the latest findings from experimental and theoretical studies, the survey provides a holistic view of the current landscape and identifies key areas for future investigation. The paper emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary approaches, combining advanced characterization techniques with sophisticated modeling tools, to develop a deeper understanding of hydrogen embrittlement and to design materials that can effectively resist this phenomenon. The insights gained from this survey will be valuable for researchers, engineers, and industry professionals working on materials for hydrogen storage, transportation, and other hydrogen-related applications [6].

# 3 Advanced Spectroscopic Techniques and Quantum Modeling

## 3.1 Theoretical Modeling and Computational Simulations

### 3.1.1 Quantum Properties of Matter and Superfluidity
Quantum properties of matter, particularly in ultracold atomic systems, have been a focal point of modern condensed matter physics due to their unique behavior and potential applications. Ultracold atoms, when cooled to temperatures near absolute zero, exhibit quantum phenomena such as superfluidity, which is characterized by the ability to flow without dissipation. This section delves into the fundamental aspects of superfluidity in ultracold atomic systems, highlighting the role of quantum mechanics in defining these properties.

In the context of ultracold atoms, superfluidity is often studied in the framework of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), where a significant fraction of the atoms occupy the same quantum state, leading to macroscopic quantum coherence. The emergence of superfluidity in BECs is closely tied to the quantization of vortices, which are topological defects that arise when the system is set into rotation. These vortices are quantized, meaning that the circulation around them is an integer multiple of Planck's constant divided by the mass of the atoms. The quantization of vortices is a direct consequence of the phase coherence of the BEC and is a hallmark of superfluid behavior.

Recent experimental advancements have extended the study of superfluidity to fermionic systems, where the pairing of fermions into bosonic Cooper pairs can lead to superfluidity, analogous to superconductivity in electronic systems [7]. The tunability of interactions in ultracold atomic systems, achieved through Feshbach resonances, has enabled the exploration of a wide range of superfluid phases, including BCS-like and BEC-like regimes. These studies not only provide insights into the fundamental physics of superfluidity but also pave the way for potential technological applications in quantum computing and precision measurements.

### 3.1.2 Electronic and Optical Properties of Complex Systems
The electronic and optical properties of complex systems, particularly metal halide perovskites (MHPs), are critical for their application in optoelectronic devices [4]. MHPs exhibit unique photophysical behaviors due to their tunable bandgap, strong light absorption, and efficient charge transport, which are essential for high-performance solar cells, LEDs, and photodetectors. However, the inherent instability of these materials, primarily due to ionic drift and chemical reactions at interfaces, poses significant challenges. Ionic drift can distort electric fields and alter the material's electronic structure, while chemical reactions can degrade device performance over time. Understanding and mitigating these issues require a deep investigation into the electronic and optical properties at both bulk and interface levels.

To probe the electronic and optical properties of MHPs, advanced spectroscopic techniques such as photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved spectroscopy are employed. These techniques provide insights into the dynamics of charge carriers, including their generation, trapping, and recombination processes. For instance, PL measurements can reveal the presence of defects and their impact on the material's performance. High spatial resolution is crucial for these studies, as wet chemistry methods often lead to morphological inhomogeneities that affect the optical properties. By analyzing the Fourier components of oscillating PL signals, researchers can extract information about photo-induced charge carrier dynamics, which is essential for developing accurate physical models that link experimental observations with material properties [8].

Furthermore, the study of surface properties in MHPs is vital for optimizing device performance. Techniques such as photocurrent relaxations and fast bias switching are used to investigate the dynamics of charge carriers at interfaces. These methods involve accumulating charge carriers and studying their behavior upon switching the bias polarity, which can reveal important details about charge trapping and recombination mechanisms. The insights gained from these studies are crucial for improving the stability and efficiency of MHP-based devices. Additionally, the development of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) and low-dimensional perovskite structures offers new opportunities for enhancing the electronic and optical properties of complex systems, potentially leading to novel applications in photocatalysis and other optoelectronic devices.

### 3.1.3 Light-Matter Interactions and Quantum Technologies
Light-matter interactions play a pivotal role in the development of quantum technologies, particularly in the context of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) [4]. These materials have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, including high photoluminescence quantum yields and tunable bandgaps. The interaction between light and MHPs involves the excitation of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, leading to the formation of excitons that can either recombine radiatively or non-radiatively. The radiative recombination process is critical for applications such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaic devices, while non-radiative recombination pathways, often associated with defects and grain boundaries, can significantly impact device performance.

In the realm of quantum technologies, the precise control of light-matter interactions at the molecular level has opened new avenues for exploring quantum phenomena [9]. Techniques such as photoluminescence microscopy and impedance spectroscopy have been instrumental in probing the dynamics of charge carriers in perovskite materials [8]. These techniques reveal that the spatial distribution of defects and grain boundaries can lead to pronounced variations in photocurrent response and photoluminescence, highlighting the importance of high spatial resolution in characterizing these materials. Moreover, the ability to manipulate these interactions through external stimuli, such as electric fields or chemical treatments, offers a pathway to enhance the performance of quantum devices.

The study of light-matter interactions in perovskites also extends to the broader field of photocatalysis, where the generation and separation of charge carriers are crucial for driving chemical reactions [8]. The unique properties of perovskites, such as their high light absorbance and tunable band structures, make them promising candidates for photocatalytic applications, including hydrogen production and environmental remediation [8]. However, challenges such as ionic drift and chemical instability must be addressed to fully realize the potential of these materials. Advances in understanding and controlling light-matter interactions in perovskites will not only contribute to the development of more efficient optoelectronic devices but also pave the way for novel quantum technologies that leverage the unique properties of these materials [4].

## 3.2 Experimental Techniques and Characterization

### 3.2.1 Spectroscopic Analysis of Material Properties
Spectroscopic analysis of material properties is crucial for understanding the fundamental behavior of perovskite materials, particularly in the context of defect characterization and the spatial distribution of charge carriers. Techniques such as photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, impedance spectroscopy, and Kelvin probe microscopy have been pivotal in elucidating these properties [10]. PL spectroscopy, in particular, has been instrumental in probing the defect properties and their influence on the PL intensity of perovskites at a sub-micrometer scale. This method allows for the differentiation of various defect types and their impact on the material's photophysical properties, which is essential for optimizing device performance.

Spatial variations in free charge carrier and exciton populations within perovskite grains have been observed using advanced spectroscopic techniques, providing insights that are not achievable with traditional ensemble methods [8]. For instance, photoluminescence microscopy has revealed that these variations can significantly affect the overall performance of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices [4]. The ability to map these variations at a sub-micrometer scale is critical for understanding the local electronic and optical properties of perovskites, which can help in designing materials with improved stability and efficiency. These findings highlight the necessity of developing and applying high-resolution spectroscopic methods to study perovskite materials in greater detail [8].

Impedance spectroscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) have also been employed to investigate the electrical properties of perovskites, particularly at interfaces and surfaces [10]. These techniques provide valuable information about the ionic drift and chemical reactions that occur at the interfaces, which are key factors affecting the stability and performance of perovskite devices [10]. By combining these spectroscopic methods, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the material's properties, from bulk behavior to surface phenomena, thereby facilitating the development of more robust and efficient perovskite-based technologies [8].

### 3.2.2 Microstructural and Optical Characterization
Microstructural and optical characterization plays a crucial role in understanding the intricate properties of perovskite materials, particularly in elucidating the impact of defects on photoluminescence (PL) intensity [8]. Traditional ensemble spectroscopy methods often fail to capture the spatial variations within perovskite grains, averaging out critical details that are essential for optimizing device performance. Advanced techniques such as photoluminescence microscopy, conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM), and Kelvin probe microscopy (KPM) have emerged as powerful tools to address this limitation. These methods provide sub-micrometer resolution, enabling the identification of nonradiative recombination pathways and the spatial distribution of free charge carriers and excitons within the material.

The subpopulation of dark grains and grain boundaries in perovskite materials acts as nonradiative recombination centers, significantly limiting the efficiency of PL emission [8]. By employing high-resolution imaging techniques, researchers can map these regions and correlate their presence with the overall optical response of the material. For instance, photoluminescence microscopy has revealed pronounced spatial variations in the photocurrent response, highlighting the importance of grain boundaries in determining the material's optoelectronic properties. This detailed characterization is essential for developing strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of defects and enhance the performance of perovskite-based devices [8].

Moreover, the investigation of surface phenomena in halide perovskite single crystals is experimentally challenging due to the localization of surface processes within a thin region, typically ≤1 μm below the interface [10]. Techniques like KPM and CAFM offer valuable insights into these surface processes but are limited in their ability to provide depth information. Despite these limitations, these methods remain indispensable for understanding the complex interplay between surface defects and bulk properties. The integration of multiple characterization techniques, each offering unique advantages, is crucial for a comprehensive analysis of perovskite materials and the development of next-generation optoelectronic devices [4].

### 3.2.3 Advanced Imaging and Manipulation Techniques
Advanced imaging and manipulation techniques have significantly advanced the field of functional microscopy, particularly through the integration of machine learning and two-photon microscopy. The machine learning regression analyses for intensity modulation two-photon microscopy (ml-IM2PM) have been pivotal in capturing the intricate dynamics of carrier trapping and charge carrier recombination processes in materials such as MAPbBr3 perovskite microcrystalline [8]. This technique leverages the high spatial resolution and depth sensitivity of two-photon excitation to provide detailed functional maps of the material, enabling researchers to probe the defect properties and their impact on photoluminescence (PL) intensity with unprecedented precision.

The development of intensity modulation two-photon excited PL microscopy (IM2PM) has further refined the study of recombination processes in perovskite films [8]. By modulating the excitation intensity, IM2PM induces oscillations in the PL signal, which can be analyzed to extract information about the carrier dynamics and defect states. This method has been particularly useful in differentiating the influence of various defects on the PL intensity, providing a spatially resolved map of the material's functional properties [8]. The ability to correlate these microscopic observations with macroscopic performance metrics has been crucial for optimizing the design of perovskite-based devices.

Kelvin probe microscopy, conductive atomic force microscopy, and photoluminescence microscopy have also played significant roles in the investigation of surface phenomena in halide perovskite single crystals [10]. However, these techniques often suffer from limited depth information, which restricts their applicability to planar-planar devices [10]. In contrast, advanced imaging techniques like IM2PM and ml-IM2PM offer a more comprehensive understanding of the material's behavior, including the localized surface processes that occur within a thin region of ≤1 μm below the interface. These advanced techniques not only enhance the spatial and temporal resolution but also provide a deeper insight into the fundamental mechanisms governing the material's optoelectronic properties.

# 4 Multiscale Modeling and Experimental Validation of Hydrogen Trapping and Embrittlement

## 4.1 Microstructural Analysis and Hydrogen Diffusion

### 4.1.1 Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy and Permeation Techniques
Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS) is a powerful technique for investigating the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of hydrogen desorption from materials [2]. By heating a sample in a vacuum and measuring the desorbed hydrogen as a function of temperature, TDS provides insights into the binding energies and activation energies of hydrogen traps. These traps can include vacancies, dislocations, grain boundaries, and precipitates, each contributing to the overall hydrogen embrittlement (HE) process. Despite its utility, TDS has limitations, notably the loss of diffusible hydrogen before measurement and the inability to determine the hydrogen diffusion rate within the specimen [2]. This limitation necessitates the use of complementary techniques to fully understand the hydrogen behavior in materials.

Permeation techniques, such as the Devanathan-Stachurski (DS) method, offer a dynamic approach to studying hydrogen diffusion and trapping. In the DS method, hydrogen is continuously generated and allowed to permeate through a thin metal film, with the hydrogen flux measured as a function of time. This technique provides real-time data on hydrogen diffusion coefficients and solubilities, which are crucial parameters for modeling hydrogen embrittlement. The DS method is particularly useful for understanding the role of grain boundaries and dislocations in hydrogen transport, as it can reveal the preferential pathways and rates of hydrogen movement through the material. By combining TDS and permeation techniques, researchers can obtain a comprehensive picture of hydrogen behavior, from the initial uptake and trapping to the subsequent diffusion and embrittlement [1].

Recent advancements in permeation techniques have further enhanced the spatial and temporal resolution of hydrogen mapping. For example, in-situ silver decoration has been used to visualize hydrogen concentration gradients at grain boundaries, revealing that high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) act as high-flux paths for hydrogen [1]. This finding underscores the importance of microstructural features in controlling hydrogen transport and embrittlement. Additionally, the integration of advanced microscopy techniques, such as electron channel contrast imaging (ECCI), has enabled the direct observation of dislocation movements caused by hydrogen desorption [11]. These combined approaches not only provide a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement but also inform the development of strategies for mitigating HE in engineering materials [1].

### 4.1.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy and Atom Probe Tomography
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Atom Probe Tomography (APT) are advanced characterization techniques that have significantly advanced the understanding of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) at the micro- and nano-scale. TEM provides high-resolution images of microstructural features, such as grain boundaries, dislocations, and precipitates, which are critical sites for hydrogen trapping and embrittlement. By utilizing techniques such as high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), researchers can directly observe the distribution of hydrogen atoms and their interactions with these microstructural features. HRTEM, in particular, allows for the visualization of dislocation structures and the strain fields around them, which are known to influence hydrogen diffusion and trapping.

APT, on the other hand, offers unparalleled three-dimensional chemical and spatial resolution, enabling the direct detection of hydrogen atoms and their precise location within the microstructure. This technique involves the field evaporation of atoms from a sharply pointed specimen, followed by their detection and reconstruction into a three-dimensional image. APT has been instrumental in identifying the specific microstructural features that act as hydrogen traps, such as grain boundaries, interfaces, and precipitates. The ability of APT to quantify the concentration of hydrogen at these sites has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement, particularly in understanding the role of microstructure heterogeneity in promoting hydrogen redistribution [12].

The complementary nature of TEM and APT has led to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between hydrogen and the microstructure of metals. For instance, TEM can reveal the morphology and distribution of microstructural features, while APT can provide detailed chemical information and quantify the hydrogen content at these sites. Together, these techniques have elucidated the critical role of grain boundaries and dislocations in hydrogen trapping, which is essential for developing microstructure-sensitive models of HE [2]. Future research should focus on integrating these high-resolution characterization methods with advanced computational models to predict and mitigate hydrogen embrittlement in materials.

### 4.1.3 Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy and X-ray Diffraction
Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) are advanced techniques that offer unique insights into the microstructural and chemical properties of materials, particularly in the context of hydrogen embrittlement (HE). SKPFM is a non-destructive, high-resolution method that measures the work function and surface potential of materials, providing valuable information about the distribution of trapped hydrogen at grain boundaries (GBs) and dislocations. By mapping the surface potential, SKPFM can identify regions of high hydrogen concentration, which are often associated with areas of increased stress and dislocation density. This technique has been instrumental in elucidating the mechanisms of hydrogen trapping and its impact on the mechanical properties of materials, such as the reduction in interfacial cohesive strength due to hydrogen ingress [3].

X-ray Diffraction (XRD) complements SKPFM by offering a deeper understanding of the crystallographic and structural changes induced by hydrogen. XRD can reveal the formation of hydrides, changes in lattice parameters, and the presence of residual stresses within the material. In particular, Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) is a powerful variant of XRD that provides three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale images of crystal defects and strain fields [11]. BCDI has been used to probe the evolution of dislocations and their associated strain fields during hydrogen charging, revealing how hydrogen interacts with crystal defects and influences the material's mechanical behavior [11]. By combining the spatial and temporal resolution of SKPFM with the structural insights provided by XRD, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between hydrogen and the microstructure of materials.

Together, these techniques have been pivotal in advancing the field of hydrogen embrittlement research. For instance, the use of SKPFM has demonstrated that grain boundaries, especially high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs), act as high-flux paths for hydrogen diffusion and trapping, leading to localized hydrogen enrichment and increased susceptibility to HE. XRD studies have further shown that the presence of hydrogen can induce significant changes in the crystal structure, such as the formation of hydrides and the relaxation of residual stresses, which can significantly affect the material's mechanical integrity. These findings highlight the importance of microstructural engineering in mitigating hydrogen embrittlement, emphasizing the need for a multi-faceted approach that combines advanced characterization techniques with theoretical modeling to develop more resilient materials for hydrogen-related applications [1].

## 4.2 Multiphysics and Phase Field Modeling

### 4.2.1 Hydrogen Transport and Stress Concentrators
In the context of hydrogen transport, stress concentrators such as grain boundaries (GBs) and triple junctions play a pivotal role in the localization and accumulation of hydrogen, significantly influencing the onset of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) [12]. Hydrostatic stresses generated in hard grains drive an increased influx of hydrogen, whereas softer grains, characterized by higher plasticity and dislocation density, trap more hydrogen [12]. GBs, in particular, act as sinks for hydrogen, where the concentration of hydrogen can be several orders of magnitude higher than in the bulk material. This is due to the enhanced local stress fields and the presence of dislocation pile-ups, which create additional trapping sites for hydrogen.

Triple junctions, intersections of three grain boundaries, are especially prone to accumulating high levels of hydrogen, potentially fostering hydrogen embrittlement and delayed cracking (HEDE). The accumulation of hydrogen at these sites is attributed to the complex stress fields and the high density of dislocations, which serve as effective traps [2]. The distribution of hydrogen within the material is often modeled using a combination of macroscopic and mesoscale approaches, with the latter providing a more detailed understanding of the microstructural effects [1]. For instance, mesoscale models based on representative volume elements (RVEs) can simulate the intricate interactions between hydrogen and the microstructure, including the formation of dislocation traps and the influence of grain boundary misorientations on hydrogen flux [1].

The local stress field enhancements at GBs and triple junctions not only increase the capacity for hydrogen trapping but also modify the diffusion kinetics, leading to non-uniform hydrogen distributions. Under low loading rates, the hydrogen distribution can reach a steady state, where the rate of hydrogen diffusion balances with the rate of trapping [12]. However, the presence of stress concentrators can disrupt this equilibrium, leading to localized regions of high hydrogen concentration. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for predicting and mitigating hydrogen embrittlement in materials used for hydrogen storage and transportation, particularly in applications involving high-pressure environments and prolonged exposure to hydrogen [3].

### 4.2.2 Fracture Mechanics and Hydrogen-Assisted Fracture
Fracture mechanics plays a pivotal role in understanding the mechanisms of hydrogen-assisted fracture, particularly in materials that are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) [6]. The primary mechanisms involved in HE, such as hydrogen-enhanced localised plasticity (HELP) and hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE), are intricately linked to the microstructural features of the material, including grain boundaries (GBs) and interfaces. HELP is characterized by the sequestration of hydrogen by dislocations, which enhances dislocation mobility and results in accelerated plastic deformation [12]. This increased plasticity can lead to the early onset of damage and the formation of microcracks, particularly in regions of high stress concentration.

HEDE, on the other hand, focuses on the weakening of interfacial cohesive strengths, such as those at GBs and other microstructural hydrogen trapping sites. The presence of hydrogen at these interfaces diminishes the cohesive forces between atoms, leading to a brittle interfacial fracture [11]. This mechanism is particularly significant in materials with high fractions of high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs), which are more susceptible to hydrogen-induced decohesion compared to low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs). The interaction between HELP and HEDE is complex and often synergistic, with the accumulation of hydrogen at dislocations and interfaces leading to a combined effect that significantly reduces the material's fracture toughness and ductility [11].

Experimental and atomistic modeling studies have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of hydrogen-assisted fracture [6]. For instance, atomistic simulations have shown that hydrogen can reduce the interaction energies between dislocations, leading to diminished hardening rates and the early onset of plasticity [12]. Additionally, the presence of hydrogen at GBs can result in accelerated decohesion, as evidenced by the increased accumulation of dislocations and the formation of microcracks [12]. These findings underscore the importance of microstructural engineering, such as grain boundary engineering (GBE), in mitigating the effects of hydrogen embrittlement and enhancing the overall performance and reliability of materials in hydrogen-rich environments [1].

### 4.2.3 Kinetic and Equilibrium Trapping Models
Kinetic and equilibrium trapping models are essential for understanding the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) and the associated material degradation [1]. These models focus on the dynamic behavior of hydrogen atoms within the material, particularly their diffusion and trapping at various microstructural features such as dislocations, vacancies, and grain boundaries [5]. The kinetic models typically describe the time-dependent processes of hydrogen diffusion and trapping, incorporating the effects of plastic deformation and the creation of new trapping sites [12]. For instance, the development of highly localized plasticity can lead to the formation of dislocation traps, which are characterized by a log-normal distribution of hydrogen concentrations [12]. This is due to the asymptotic stress fields that evolve during plastic deformation, leading to the accumulation of hydrogen at these sites [5].

Equilibrium trapping models, on the other hand, assume that the system reaches a steady state where the hydrogen flux into and out of the trapping sites is balanced. These models are useful for predicting the long-term behavior of hydrogen in materials, especially under conditions where the loading rates are low compared to the diffusion timescales. In such scenarios, the hydrogen distribution can be considered to be at a quasi-steady state, where the concentration of hydrogen at trapping sites is determined by the balance between the trapping and detrapping rates. The interfacial cohesive strengths of grain boundaries and other microstructural features are significantly diminished by the presence of hydrogen, leading to brittle interfacial fracture rather than ductile void growth and coalescence [2]. This phenomenon is well-documented in experimental studies and is a critical factor in the overall embrittlement process.

To bridge the gap between the microscopic and macroscopic scales, multiscale models have been developed that incorporate both kinetic and equilibrium trapping mechanisms. These models often use a phase-field approach to simulate the evolution of hydrogen concentration and the formation of trapping sites at the microscale, while also accounting for the macroscopic deformation and damage processes. The phase-field models are derived from a total free energy functional, which includes terms for the elastic energy, the chemical potential of hydrogen, and the energy associated with the formation of trapping sites. By solving the resulting partial differential equations, these models can predict the spatial and temporal distribution of hydrogen and its impact on the material's mechanical properties. The integration of kinetic and equilibrium trapping models in a multiscale framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between hydrogen and the material microstructure, which is crucial for the development of effective mitigation strategies for hydrogen embrittlement [2].

# 5 Astrophysical and Geophysical Simulations and Observations

## 5.1 Stellar and Galactic Dynamics

### 5.1.1 Magnetic Mode Suppression in Red Giants
Magnetic mode suppression in red giants is a phenomenon where the amplitudes of dipole (ℓ = 1) oscillation modes are significantly reduced compared to their expected values, indicating the presence of a strong internal magnetic field [13]. This suppression is thought to occur due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the oscillation modes, leading to additional damping mechanisms that are not present in stars with weaker or no internal magnetic fields. The suppression of dipole modes is particularly evident in red giants that have climbed the red giant branch (RGB) and are expected to have developed strong internal magnetic fields, often associated with the presence of a convective core or a rapidly rotating core.

The mechanism of magnetic mode suppression is complex and involves the interaction between the magnetic field and the oscillation modes within the star. In red giants, the dipole modes are particularly sensitive to the presence of a strong magnetic field because they penetrate deeper into the stellar interior, where the magnetic field is expected to be the strongest. The suppression of these modes is not uniform across all red giants; it depends on factors such as the strength and topology of the internal magnetic field, the stellar mass, and the evolutionary stage of the star [13]. The suppression of higher spherical degree (ℓ > 1) modes can also occur, but the threshold for this suppression is generally higher, and the effect is less pronounced compared to dipole modes.

Recent studies have used asteroseismology to probe the internal magnetic fields of red giants by analyzing the suppression of dipole modes. These studies have revealed that the suppression of dipole modes is not a universal feature among red giants but is more common in stars with specific characteristics, such as those with a more massive core or those that have experienced significant core rotation [13]. The suppression of dipole modes in these stars provides a unique window into the internal structure and dynamics of red giants, offering insights into the role of magnetic fields in stellar evolution and the processes that govern the internal structure of these stars as they ascend the RGB.

### 5.1.2 Bar Resonances and Galactic Bar Properties
Bar resonances play a crucial role in shaping the dynamical and chemical properties of the Galactic bar. These resonances, primarily the corotation resonance (CR) and the inner Lindblad resonance (ILR), influence the orbital structure and kinematics of stars within the bar [14]. The pattern speed of the Galactic bar, denoted by Ω, is a fundamental parameter that determines the location of these resonances [14]. Recent observational constraints suggest a pattern speed of approximately 32-35 km s\(^{-1}\) kpc\(^{-1}\), placing the corotation radius at about 6.5-7.5 kpc. This range is consistent with the measured rotation velocity of the Galactic disk, which is around 230-240 km s\(^{-1}\).

The formation and evolution of the Galactic bar are closely tied to the gravitational instability of the disk, which can be triggered by various mechanisms, including mergers [15]. The bar is thought to have formed around 3-8 Gyr ago, and its subsequent evolution has been influenced by processes such as the buckling instability. This instability leads to the transformation of the bar from a flat, elongated structure into a boxy/peanut-shaped morphology. The buckling process is accompanied by vertical heating of the stellar orbits, which contributes to the thickening of the bar. Additionally, the bar's deceleration over time, driven by interactions with the dark matter halo and the disk, further modifies its properties and the distribution of stars within it [14].

Stars on bar-shaped orbits exhibit distinct chemodynamical characteristics, reflecting their origin and the processes they have undergone. These stars are predominantly metal-rich, with a significant fraction having metallicities higher than the average field population [15]. The combination of data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and Gaia has allowed for a detailed tracing of these properties, revealing that the bar collects material from both the outer and inner regions of the Galaxy. The transport of stars through resonances, particularly the ILR and CR, plays a key role in this mixing process. Understanding the interplay between these resonances and the chemical enrichment history of the bar is essential for constraining models of Galactic evolution and the formation of the Milky Way's central structure.

### 5.1.3 Stellar Orbits and Dark Matter Halo Analysis
Stellar orbits within the Galactic halo provide crucial insights into the dynamical history and the distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way [16]. By analyzing the kinematic properties of stars, particularly those in the outer halo, researchers can infer the gravitational potential and, consequently, the mass distribution of the dark matter halo. The orbital parameters, such as eccentricity, inclination, and angular momentum, are key indicators of the past interactions and mergers that have shaped the Galaxy. For instance, the presence of distinct substructures in the velocity space, such as the Gaia Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), suggests that significant accretion events have contributed to the build-up of the halo. These substructures are characterized by specific ranges of orbital parameters, which can be used to trace the origins and the evolutionary paths of the accreted material.

The analysis of stellar orbits also plays a pivotal role in understanding the dynamics of the Galactic bar, which is believed to influence the kinematics of stars in the inner regions of the Milky Way. The bar's pattern speed and its impact on stellar orbits can be studied by examining the distribution of stars in phase space. Stars that are trapped in resonances with the bar exhibit characteristic patterns in their orbits, which can be identified through detailed simulations and observational data. These resonant structures not only reveal the bar's properties but also provide constraints on the mass and shape of the dark matter halo. The interplay between the bar and the halo is particularly evident in the asymmetric distribution of velocities and the presence of moving groups in the halo, which are indicative of ongoing dynamical processes.

Moreover, the study of stellar orbits in the context of dark matter halo analysis extends to the examination of the halo's substructure and the potential presence of dark matter subhalos [16]. The disruption of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters can lead to the formation of tidal streams, which are tracers of the underlying gravitational potential [16]. By fitting orbits to these streams, researchers can infer the mass and density profile of the dark matter halo. Additionally, the detection of cold streams, which are characterized by low velocity dispersion, can provide direct evidence for the existence of dark matter subhalos. The combination of high-resolution numerical simulations and precise astrometric data from surveys like Gaia allows for a comprehensive exploration of the halo's complex structure, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dark matter distribution in the Milky Way.

## 5.2 Planetary and Atmospheric Modeling

### 5.2.1 Vortex Formation and Planetesimal Formation
Vortex formation within protoplanetary disks plays a critical role in the early stages of planetesimal formation, particularly in environments characterized by low metallicity [17]. Vortices, which are regions of enhanced pressure and reduced turbulence, act as natural traps for solid particles, concentrating them to levels sufficient for gravitational instability to occur. This process is essential in overcoming the radial drift barrier, a phenomenon where small dust grains are rapidly transported inward toward the central star due to gas drag, thus preventing their accumulation into larger bodies. By trapping and accumulating particles, vortices provide a mechanism for the rapid growth of solids into planetesimals, which are the building blocks of planets.

In low-metallicity disks, the formation of planetesimals is particularly challenging due to the scarcity of solid material. However, vortices can significantly enhance the local solid-to-gas ratio, making planetesimal formation feasible even under these conditions. The efficiency of this process depends on several factors, including the strength of the turbulence (characterized by the α parameter), the Stokes number (St) of the particles, and the metallicity (Z) of the disk. For instance, vortex trapping is less effective for particles with St = 0.03 and Z = 0.01, especially in disks with realistic turbulence levels (α ∼ 10^−3 − 10^−2) [18]. Despite these challenges, simulations have shown that vortices can still facilitate the formation of planetesimals by increasing the local concentration of solids and reducing the effects of turbulence.

To better understand the role of vortices in planetesimal formation, researchers have conducted extensive numerical simulations that explore the interplay between disk properties and vortex dynamics [17]. These studies have revealed that vortices can form through various mechanisms, such as the Rossby wave instability (RWI) and the dead zone edge instability. Once formed, vortices can persist for extended periods, providing a stable environment for particle accumulation and growth. The subsequent accretion of pebbles onto these planetesimals further enhances their growth, potentially leading to the formation of larger planetary embryos. This process is particularly important in the context of low-metallicity environments, where traditional mechanisms of planetesimal formation may be insufficient. Thus, the study of vortices offers valuable insights into the early stages of planet formation and the conditions necessary for the emergence of planetary systems [17].

### 5.2.2 Photochemical Models of Early Earth Atmosphere
Photochemical models of the early Earth's atmosphere are crucial for understanding the chemical processes that led to the formation of prebiotic molecules and the eventual emergence of life [19]. These models typically simulate the interactions between ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the young Sun and the atmospheric constituents, primarily hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4). The focus is on how these interactions influence the production and loss rates of various chemical species, including carbon oxides and organic matter. The early Earth's atmosphere is hypothesized to have been highly reducing, with a significant abundance of H2 and CH4, which would have provided a favorable environment for the synthesis of complex organic molecules.

The photochemical models incorporate detailed reaction networks that account for the formation and destruction of molecules through photolysis, chemical reactions, and other processes. A key aspect of these models is the UV shielding effect of gaseous hydrocarbons, which can significantly reduce the photodissociation of methane and other organic compounds [19]. This shielding is crucial because it allows for the accumulation of organic matter in the atmosphere and on the surface, which could have served as the building blocks for life. The models also explore the role of hydrogen escape, which could have gradually oxidized the atmosphere over time, although the rate of this process is thought to have been relatively slow.

Numerical simulations within these models provide insights into the atmospheric profiles, including the vertical distribution of various chemical species and their deposition rates on the early Earth's surface. By comparing the results with and without the UV absorption by hydrocarbons, these models help clarify the importance of UV shielding in the photochemical evolution of the early Earth's atmosphere [19]. The findings from these models contribute to our understanding of the conditions that may have prevailed on the early Earth and the processes that could have facilitated the origin of life.

### 5.2.3 Trace Element Analysis in Volcanic Materials
Trace element analysis in volcanic materials provides a critical window into the composition of the Earth's mantle and the processes that govern the formation and evolution of volcanic systems [20]. By examining the concentrations and isotopic compositions of trace elements in volcanic rocks, researchers can infer the sources and pathways of magmas, as well as the geochemical processes that occur during their ascent and emplacement. This section focuses on the methodologies and findings of trace element analysis, highlighting its importance in understanding the deep Earth's structure and dynamics.

Recent studies have employed advanced analytical techniques, such as laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), to measure trace elements in volcanic materials with high precision and spatial resolution. These techniques have revealed complex patterns of trace element enrichment and depletion, which are often linked to the presence of fluid and melt inclusions, as well as the interaction between magmas and the surrounding crust. For instance, the enrichment of elements like thorium and uranium in certain volcanic rocks can provide insights into the heat budget of the Earth's interior and the potential for geoneutrino production [20].

Moreover, the analysis of trace elements in volcanic materials has significant implications for understanding large-scale geological events, such as mass extinctions and the formation of large igneous provinces. For example, the measurement of iridium and other platinum group elements in volcanic rocks has been used to investigate the impact hypothesis for the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary, which is associated with the extinction of the dinosaurs [20]. Additionally, the systematic study of trace elements in volcanic materials from different tectonic settings, such as mid-ocean ridges, island arcs, and continental rifts, has helped to constrain the geochemical signatures of various mantle reservoirs and the processes that govern their mixing and differentiation.

# 6 Future Directions


Despite the significant progress made in understanding hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in metals, several limitations and gaps remain. Current research often lacks a comprehensive integration of experimental and theoretical approaches, leading to a fragmented understanding of the complex interactions between hydrogen and the microstructure of materials. The spatial and temporal resolution of existing techniques is insufficient to fully capture the dynamic behavior of hydrogen at the atomic and microscale levels, particularly in real-time and under in situ conditions. Additionally, the predictive capabilities of multiphysics models are limited by the lack of detailed experimental data on the kinetics and equilibrium of hydrogen trapping, as well as the influence of microstructural heterogeneity on hydrogen diffusion and embrittlement.

To address these limitations, future research should focus on developing and integrating advanced characterization techniques with sophisticated modeling tools. One promising direction is the enhancement of in situ and operando techniques, such as in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in situ scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM), to provide real-time observations of hydrogen diffusion and trapping at the micro- and nanoscale. These techniques can be complemented by the development of high-resolution spectroscopic methods, such as time-resolved photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy, to map the spatial distribution of hydrogen and its impact on the material's electronic and mechanical properties. Furthermore, the integration of machine learning algorithms with these experimental techniques can enable the automated analysis of large datasets, leading to more accurate and detailed insights into the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement.

Another critical area for future research is the development of multiscale models that can accurately predict the behavior of hydrogen in materials from the atomic to the macroscale. This requires the incorporation of detailed microstructural information, such as grain boundary misorientations and dislocation densities, into kinetic and equilibrium trapping models. The use of phase-field modeling, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic interactions between hydrogen and the microstructure. Additionally, the development of hybrid models that combine experimental data with theoretical predictions can enhance the predictive capabilities of these models, enabling the design of materials with improved resistance to hydrogen embrittlement.

The potential impact of the proposed future work is substantial. By addressing the current limitations and gaps in the understanding of hydrogen embrittlement, researchers can develop more resilient materials for hydrogen-related applications, such as hydrogen storage, transportation, and fuel cells. The integration of advanced characterization techniques and sophisticated modeling tools will not only advance the fundamental understanding of hydrogen embrittlement but also inform the development of innovative materials and engineering solutions. This could lead to significant improvements in the safety and efficiency of hydrogen-based technologies, contributing to the broader goal of transitioning to a sustainable and clean energy future.
