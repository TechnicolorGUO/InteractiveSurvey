# 1. Introduction  

Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is formally defined as the reduction in a metal's toughness or ductility due to the presence of atomic hydrogen [16].

This phenomenon leads to a significant degradation of mechanical properties, including decreased tensile strength, fatigue strength, and fracture toughness, and can result in brittle fracture at stresses below the material's yield strength or plastic deformation capacity [3,22,28,29]. The detrimental effects of HE pose a critical threat to structural integrity and operational safety across diverse industries [3,11]. Specific examples of HE-induced failures include sudden fractures in high-strength structural steels used in aerospace [22], cracking in pipeline steels exposed to hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide environments within the oil and gas sector [2,4,23,24], and compromised components in the burgeoning hydrogen energy infrastructure, such as pipelines, storage tanks, and welding joints [2,4,6,10,28]. In the automotive industry, the increased utilization of high-strength steels for lightweighting necessitates addressing HE, which poses significant safety challenges [13,18,20], as well as concerns for high-strength aluminum alloys used in vehicle manufacturing [14].  

The understanding and research into hydrogen embrittlement have evolved over time. Early investigations into failures, such as aircraft failures during World War II and the appearance of white spots in heavy rail steel and internal cracks in lowalloy high-strength steel in the 1930s, pointed to the role of hydrogen in metallic materials [11,31,35]. Pioneering work, including Mr. Li Xun's contributions to establishing methods for quantifying hydrogen content in steel, laid foundational knowledge in the field [31,36]. Despite extensive research efforts employing multi-scale experimental and theoretical methods, a unified, comprehensive theoretical understanding of HE mechanisms remains elusive [3,29]. Many fundamental aspects, including precise hydrogen characterization and definitive failure criteria, require further clarification [29].​  

A primary challenge in mitigating HE lies in the inherent trade-off between increasing material strength and maintaining resistance to hydrogen-induced degradation; higher strength steels are generally more susceptible to HE [12,18,22,26,27]. This intensified susceptibility poses significant challenges for designing materials for critical applications, particularly in the context of lightweighting initiatives and the expansion of hydrogen energy systems [3,26,27]. Consequently, the development of effective mitigation strategies for high-strength steels and other susceptible alloys is critically motivated by the need to ensure structural reliability and safety in hydrogen-rich environments [3,5,26,27].​  

Hydrogen accumulation at lattice defects, such as dislocations, grain boundaries, inclusions, voids, and precipitates, is widely recognized as a major factor contributing to HE [2,6,18,20]. Therefore, effectively controlling hydrogen diffusion and trapping behavior within the material microstructure has become a central focus in current research aiming to enhance HE resistance [1,12,17,18,19,20,26]. This review aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of hydrogen trapping in metals and its critical role in hydrogen embrittlement. The following sections will systematically discuss the fundamental mechanisms of hydrogen trapping, various types of trapping sites, methods for characterizing hydrogen behavior and trapping, and strategies for designing materials with enhanced hydrogen trapping characteristics to mitigate HE.  

# 2. Fundamentals of Hydrogen Embrittlement  

Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) represents a critical phenomenon affecting the structural integrity of metallic materials, characterized by a reduction in ductility, toughness, and load-bearing capacity upon exposure to or presence of hydrogen [2,3,4,8,16,22,27,28,35]. This can lead to premature fracture or sudden brittle failure [22]. HE manifests in various forms, including Hydrogen-Induced Cracking (HIC), Stress-Oriented Hydrogen-Induced Cracking (SOHIC), and hydrogen blistering [4,23,24,33]. Other related phenomena include hydrogen-induced delayed cracking, Hydrogen Attack at elevated temperatures, and the formation of white spots in large sections [11,24,33]. HIC, specifically, involves internal cracking often in wet $H _ { 2 } S$ environments and can occur without external tensile stress [23,24,33]. SOHIC and Sulfide Stress Cracking (SSC) are more complex modes that arise from the combined effects of hydrogen and applied or residual tensile stress, often localized to high-hardness zones like welds [8,23,24,33]. Hydrogen blistering involves the formation of surface bulges due to high internal hydrogen gas pressure [2].​  

A fundamental distinction is made between internal hydrogen embrittlement (IHE) and environmental hydrogen embrittlement (EHE) [3,16,22]. IHE arises from hydrogen introduced into the material during manufacturing or processing, such as smelting, pickling, electroplating, heat treatment, welding, or forming operations, before the component is placed in service [3,8,22,28,31,33,35,36]. EHE occurs when hydrogen is absorbed from the surrounding environment during service, including exposure to gaseous hydrogen, corrosive solutions (especially those containing $H _ { 2 } S$ ), or during electrochemical processes like cathodic protection [2,4,16,24,28,29]. The primary difference lies in the source of hydrogen and the necessity for ongoing hydrogen entry from the environment in EHE, involving steps like molecular dissociation, adsorption, and absorption [22].​  

![](images/1962f6fa5350f8af59317f785b04dda9af4bcbe006dcf954bb98aa89e6ae1a5e.jpg)  

Hydrogen ingress into metals is a multi-step process beginning with the interaction of hydrogen with the metal surface [2,28,29]. Molecular hydrogen $( H _ { 2 }$ ) must first dissociate into atomic hydrogen (H) on the metal surface, which can be a highenergy barrier process, particularly in gaseous environments [4]. These atoms then adsorb onto the surface ( $M H _ { a d s }$ ) before being absorbed into the bulk metal ( $M H _ { a b s }$ ) [28,29]:​  

$$
H _ { 2 } + 2 M \left. 2 M H _ { a d s } \right. 2 M H _ { a b s }
$$  

Electrochemical hydrogen entry, such as during cathodic charging or corrosion, directly generates atomic hydrogen on the surface, facilitating absorption [29]. Parameters like current density, potential, and electrolyte composition influence the  

amount of hydrogen introduced electrochemically, with concentration often proportional to the square root of current density, $C _ { \mathrm { H } } \propto \sqrt { i }$ [29].  

Once absorbed, hydrogen dissolves within the metal lattice. Hydrogen solubility, the equilibrium concentration of dissolved hydrogen, is primarily dependent on temperature, pressure, and material composition [3,11,28,29]. Under equilibrium conditions with hydrogen gas, solubility often follows Sievert’s law:​  

$$
C _ { H } = S \sqrt { P _ { \mathrm { H _ { 2 } } } }
$$  

where $\boldsymbol { S }$ is the solubility constant and $P _ { \mathrm { { H _ { 2 } } } }$ ​ is the hydrogen partial pressure [3,28,29]. For many metals (e.g., Fe, Ni), hydrogen dissolution is endothermic, and solubility increases with temperature following an Arrhenius relationship:  

$$
C _ { H } = C _ { 0 } \ : P _ { \mathrm { H _ { 2 } } } ^ { 1 / 2 } \ : e ^ { - \frac { \Delta H _ { s } } { R T } }
$$  

where $\Delta H _ { s }$ ​ is the dissolution enthalpy [11,28]. However, some metals exhibit exothermic dissolution and decreased solubility with increasing temperature [11]. Material microstructure, including phase structure and grain size, and composition significantly influence solubility and local hydrogen content [11,25,34].​  

Hydrogen transport within the metal occurs primarily through lattice diffusion, a rapid process described by Fick’s laws, where flux ( $J _ { H } \mathbf { \Psi } )$ is proportional to the concentration gradient ( $\nabla C _ { H }$ ) [6,10,11,16,28]:  

$$
J _ { H } = - D _ { H } \nabla C _ { H }
$$  

The diffusion coefficient $( D _ { H } )$ is highly temperature-dependent, obeying an Arrhenius relation  

$$
D = D _ { 0 } \exp \left( - { \frac { Q } { R T } } \right)
$$  

where $Q$ is the activation energy for diffusion [11]. Beyond lattice diffusion, hydrogen is strongly influenced by interactions with microstructural features such as vacancies, dislocations, grain boundaries, precipitates, and interfaces. These sites act as "traps" where hydrogen can accumulate, leading to local concentrations far exceeding the average lattice concentration [1,3,6,10,25,34]. Stress gradients, particularly hydrostatic stress fields at crack tips, also drive hydrogen diffusion towards stressed regions, modifying the effective diffusion coefficient and exacerbating local accumulation [3,6,10]. The ease of hydrogen permeation through a material is characterized by permeability $( P _ { e } )$ , defined as the product of diffusivity and solubility ( $P _ { e } = D \cdot S$ ) [6].​  

The susceptibility of metals to HE is critically dependent on a confluence of factors: material properties (composition, microstructure, strength, hardness), environmental conditions (hydrogen partial pressure, temperature, presence of promoters like $H _ { 2 } S$ or inhibitors, pH, electrochemical potential), and applied or residual stress [8,28,31,35,36]. Understanding the interplay of these factors with hydrogen entry, solubility, diffusion, and trapping is fundamental to comprehending the mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement and developing mitigation strategies.

Hydrogen can enter metallic materials from a variety of sources, broadly categorized into environmental and process‐ induced factors [22,33]. Environmental sources include exposure to high‑pressure hydrogen gas [2,29], corrosive environments where hydrogen sulfide $( H _ { 2 } S )$ is present—leading to hydrogen generation through corrosion reactions [23,24]—and general environmental absorption [33]. Process‑induced hydrogen uptake can occur during manufacturing or finishing steps such as smelting (from moisture in raw materials) [22,33], pickling, electroplating, electrocleaning, heat treatment, welding, and forming operations [8,22,35,36].  

The mechanisms by which hydrogen enters metals involve a sequence of steps starting with the dissociation of molecular hydrogen $\left( \mathsf { H } _ { 2 } \right)$ into atomic hydrogen (H) on the metal surface, followed by adsorption and then absorption into the bulk [2,28,29]. The initial surface reactions for adsorption can be reversible [28]:​  

$$
H _ { 2 } + 2 M  2 M H _ { a d s }
$$  

where $M$ represents the metal surface and $M H _ { a d s }$ is adsorbed atomic hydrogen [28]. This is followed by absorption, where $M H _ { a d s }$ transitions to dissolved hydrogen $M H _ { a b s }$ ​ [29].  

A distinction is drawn between “atmosphere hydrogen” and “electrochemical cathodic hydrogen” based on the driving force for diffusion and the state of the metal surface [4]. For “atmosphere hydrogen” in direct gaseous environments, the dissociation of $\mathsf { H } _ { 2 }$ into H atoms required for entry is a step with a high energy barrier, and studies indicate that only a small fraction of $\mathsf { H }$ atoms permeate the metal lattice during gaseous charging [4]. Factors such as stress and the presence of impurity gases (e.g., CO, $\mathsf { O } _ { 2 }$ ) can significantly influence $\mathsf { H } _ { 2 }$ adsorption and dissociation on the steel surface, thereby affecting hydrogen entry [4]. Compressive stress, for instance, can inhibit $\mathsf { H } _ { 2 }$ dissociation, while polar molecules can suppress hydrogen adsorption [4]. In contrast, “electrochemical cathodic hydrogen” entry, typical during processes like cathodic charging or corrosion, involves hydrogen evolution reactions on the metal surface which directly generate atomic hydrogen available for absorption [29]. While the initial entry processes differ—particularly regarding H atom generation and surface conditions—the subsequent mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement within the steel matrix is considered the same for both “cathodic hydrogen” and “atmosphere hydrogen” once the hydrogen atoms have entered [4]. Studies frequently utilize electrochemical or cathodic charging methods to introduce hydrogen for controlled laboratory investigations [7,13,17,25]. The amount of hydrogen introduced electrochemically is influenced by parameters such as charging current density, potential, time, electrolyte composition, and temperature [29]. Hydrogen concentration during electrochemical charging is often proportional to the square root of the current density,  

$$
C _ { \mathrm { H } } = { K } { \sqrt { i } } .
$$  

Once hydrogen atoms are on the metal surface, they are absorbed and dissolve into the bulk material. Hydrogen solubility— the equilibrium concentration of dissolved hydrogen—is fundamentally governed by temperature, pressure, and material composition [3,11,28,29]. Under thermodynamic equilibrium and ideal conditions, the concentration of dissolved hydrogen ( $C _ { H }$ ​ or $C _ { \mathrm { H } }$ ) in a metal exposed to hydrogen gas is related to the hydrogen partial pressure ( $p _ { H _ { 2 } }$ ​​ or $P _ { \mathrm { { H _ { 2 } } } }$ ​ ) by Sievert’s law [3,28,29]:​  

$$
C _ { H } = K \cdot p _ { H _ { 2 } } \mathrm { o r } C _ { \mathrm { H } } = S \sqrt { P _ { \mathrm { H } _ { 2 } } } .
$$  

Here, $K$ and $\boldsymbol { S }$ are solubility constants dependent on the material and temperature. The temperature dependence of hydrogen solubility in many metals—particularly those where dissolution is an endothermic reaction (e.g., Fe, Ni, Mn, Cu, Cr) —follows an Arrhenius‑type relationship [11,28]:​  

$$
C _ { H } = C _ { 0 } p _ { H _ { 2 } } e ^ { - { \frac { \Delta H _ { s } } { { \cal R } T } } } ,
$$  

where $C _ { 0 }$ ​ is a pre‑exponential factor, $\Delta H _ { s }$ is the dissociation enthalpy of the hydrogen molecule, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature [28]. For endothermic dissolution, solubility increases with increasing temperature [11,16]. Conversely, in some active metals (e.g., rare earth, Group ⅣB, and ⅤB metals), hydrogen dissolution is exothermic, and solubility decreases with increasing temperature, often leading to hydride formation [11]. Material composition and microstructure significantly influence solubility. Different phase structures can exhibit varying hydrogen solubility; for example, $\gamma$ ‑Fe has higher solubility than $\alpha$ ‑Fe at $9 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ and 1 atm [11]. Alloying elements can alter the electronic structure and lattice parameters, affecting hydrogen dissolution enthalpy and thus solubility [34]. Microstructural features also play a role; studies show that smaller grain sizes in pure iron result in higher total hydrogen content due to the increased grain boundary area acting as potential hydrogen sites [25]. The morphology of retained austenite can also influence hydrogen dissolution behavior [34]. While average dissolved hydrogen concentrations can be low (e.g., $( 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } ) \%$ atomic fraction in bcc iron at room temperature and 0.1 MPa) [1,3], local hydrogen enrichment is crucial for embrittlement [3].  

Hydrogen atoms, being small, diffuse rapidly through the metal lattice [11,16]. This lattice diffusion is the primary transport mechanism and is typically described by Fick’s laws, where the hydrogen flux ( $J _ { H }$ ​ or $J$ ) is proportional to the negative concentration gradient ( $\nabla C _ { H }$ ​ or $\partial \phi / \partial X$ ) [6,10,28]. Fick’s first law is given as:​  

$$
J _ { H } = - D _ { H } \nabla C _ { H } ,
$$  

where $D _ { H }$ is the diffusivity (diffusion coefficient) [28]. The diffusion coefficient $D$ is highly temperature‑dependent, typically following an Arrhenius relationship [11]:  

$$
D = D _ { 0 } \ \exp \left( - { \frac { Q } { R T } } \right) ,
$$  

where $D _ { 0 }$ ​ is the pre‑exponential factor, $Q$ is the diffusion activation energy, $R$ is the gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature [11]. Diffusion coefficients in metals range widely, typically between $1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ and $1 0 ^ { - 1 0 } ~ \mathsf { c m } ^ { 2 } / \mathsf { s }$ [11].​  

Beyond lattice diffusion, hydrogen transport is significantly influenced by microstructural features and external stresses. Hydrogen atoms tend to diffuse and accumulate at lattice defects—such as vacancies, dislocations, grain boundaries, interfaces, and precipitates [1,10,25,34]. These sites act as “traps,” where hydrogen can accumulate at concentrations significantly higher than in the perfect lattice, a phenomenon known as hydrogen trapping [3,10]. The presence and nature of these traps, influenced by microstructure (e.g., grain size, retained austenite, inclusions, precipitates) and composition (e.g., element segregation at interfaces), profoundly affect overall hydrogen diffusion behavior and local concentration [6,13,25]. Stress gradients, particularly hydrostatic stress fields and stress concentrations at crack tips, also drive hydrogen diffusion towards regions of higher stress, modifying the effective diffusion coefficient and leading to local hydrogen accumulation [3,6,10]. A more comprehensive model for hydrogen flux under combined gradients can include effects from temperature (Soret effect) and stress, in addition to concentration:​  

$$
J = - s D \frac { \partial \phi } { \partial X } + \kappa _ { s } \frac \partial { \partial X } \ln \theta - \theta Z + \kappa _ { p } \frac { \partial p } { \partial X } ,
$$  

where $s$ is hydrogen solubility, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $\phi$ is the normalized concentration, $\theta$ is the thermodynamic temperature, $p$ is the negative hydrostatic pressure, and $\kappa _ { s }$ ​ and $\kappa _ { p }$ ​ are coefficients related to the Soret effect and stress, respectively [6]. The permeability $( P _ { e } )$ , which represents the ease with which hydrogen permeates through a material, is defined as the product of the diffusion coefficient $( D )$ and solubility $( S )$ :​  

$$
P _ { e } = D S .
$$  

The behavior of hydrogen within the metal lattice—including its dissolution and diffusion—can be described using models such as the lattice gas model [11]. This model treats hydrogen atoms as interstitial species occupying specific sites within the crystal lattice, interacting with the host atoms and each other, and provides a theoretical framework for understanding solubility and diffusion phenomena. However, the complexity introduced by various trapping sites requires more advanced models to accurately predict hydrogen distribution in real microstructures.

Hydrogen in metals can manifest in several distinct damage phenomena, significantly impacting structural integrity. These phenomena include Hydrogen-Induced Cracking (HIC), Stress-Orientated Hydrogen-Induced Cracking (SOHIC), and hydrogen blistering [2,23,24,33]. Hydrogen embrittlement broadly refers to the reduction in ductility or load-bearing capacity of a metal, leading to premature fracture or brittle failure under stress [22].  

Hydrogen-Induced Cracking (HIC) is a critical failure mode, particularly prevalent in carbon and low-alloy steels exposed to hydrogen-bearing environments such as wet $H _ { 2 } S$ [2,23,24,33]. HIC is characterized by the formation of internal cracks within the steel matrix resulting from diffused hydrogen [31,35,36]. A key characteristic of HIC is its ability to initiate and propagate even without the application of external tensile stress [23,24,33]. The mechanism of HIC in wet $H _ { 2 } S$ environments involves corrosion reactions on the steel surface that produce hydrogen atoms. These atoms diffuse into the steel and accumulate at internal defects or minuscule voids [16,33]. At these trapping sites, hydrogen atoms can recombine to form molecular hydrogen $\left( H _ { 2 } \right)$ ), leading to the build-up of high localized pressure that facilitates crack initiation and propagation, ultimately causing brittle fracture [2,16,33]. The fracture surfaces associated with HIC often resemble other brittle fractures [35,36]. In high-strength materials, intergranular fracture is commonly observed [31,35,36]. For low-carbon steels, the intergranular facets may exhibit fine, incomplete dimples, sometimes termed "chicken claw patterns" [31,35,36].  

Hydrogen blistering is another phenomenon observed in environments promoting hydrogen absorption, such as wet $H _ { 2 } S$ [2,23,24,33]. It is caused by the significant pressure generated by the formation of molecular hydrogen at trapping sites, typically just beneath the surface of the material. This high local pressure leads to localized plastic deformation and the formation of visible bulges or blisters on the metal surface [2].​  

Stress-Oriented Hydrogen-Induced Cracking (SOHIC) is frequently considered a more complex damage mode that arises from the combined effects of HIC and applied or residual stresses, particularly in wet $H _ { 2 } S$ environments [23,24,33]. SOHIC involves the formation of HIC cracks that then link up and propagate perpendicular to the direction of the principal tensile stress. Sulfide Stress Cracking (SSC), often discussed alongside HIC and SOHIC in wet $H _ { 2 } S$ environments, primarily occurs in high-hardness regions, such as weld zones and heat-affected zones (HAZ), and requires the presence of tensile stress [8,23,24,33]. In steels with strength up to 485 MPa, hydrogen can cause longitudinal cracks in the HAZ, while at higher strengths (above ${ 8 3 0 } \mathsf { M P a } , \mathsf { \Pi }$ ), transverse cracks may also occur in the weld metal [8]. Another form of hydrogen damage, hydrogen-induced delayed cracking, can occur during welding due to hydrogen absorption from welding consumables. If this hydrogen does not adequately diffuse out during cooling, it can accumulate and create high local pressure, leading to micro-cracks in the weld metal [23,24,33].​  

Distinct from these lower-temperature phenomena, Hydrogen Attack occurs at elevated temperatures (typically $3 0 0 { - } 5 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ and high hydrogen partial pressures. In this mechanism, hydrogen reacts with carbon within the steel to form methane ( $C H _ { 4 }$ ​ ), predominantly along grain boundaries. The formation of high-pressure methane bubbles embrittles the material [11]. White spots represent another manifestation of hydrogen damage, particularly observed in large steel sections like heavy rails and forgings [11]. These internal defects are caused by the precipitation of hydrogen molecules into highpressure bubbles during the cooling of steel, where the rapid cooling rate prevents adequate hydrogen diffusion to the surface [11]. Under the combined action of high-pressure hydrogen molecules and internal stresses (thermal or structural), these bubbles lead to the formation of macroscopic flaws [11].​  

Internal defects serve as crucial nucleation sites for several of these hydrogen damage phenomena. Inclusions, particularly at the interface between the inclusion and the surrounding metal matrix, can act as hydrogen trapping sites, increasing the risk of HIC [6]. Grain boundaries are also significant trapping sites and pathways for hydrogen-assisted crack propagation [7,14], particularly in high-strength materials where intergranular fracture is common [31,35,36]. Lattice defects also interact with diffusing hydrogen atoms, accelerating damage nucleation and extension [12]. The stress field at crack tips further promotes hydrogen accumulation, exacerbating the cracking process [12].​  

Comparing these phenomena, HIC is characterized by internal cracking occurring without external stress, while SOHIC and SSC necessitate the presence of tensile stress and are often localized to high-hardness zones like welds [23,24,33]. Hydrogen blistering results in surface deformation rather than solely internal cracking. Hydrogen attack and white spots are distinct in their operating conditions (high temperature/pressure for hydrogen attack, cooling of large sections for white spots) and mechanisms (methane formation for hydrogen attack, high-pressure $H _ { 2 }$ ​ bubbles from precipitation for white spots) [11]. Material type and microstructure significantly influence the susceptibility to these damage modes and the resulting fracture appearance. For instance, the fracture mode in ferritic stainless steel transitions from ductile to brittle with increased hydrogen content, progressing from transgranular to intergranular fracture [7]. Similarly, studies show a shift from ductile fracture (void coalescence) to more brittle modes like shear-type fracture or quasi-cleavage in hydrogen-charged samples, dependent on factors like grain size or material processing [13,25]. Hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity can be assessed through mechanical tests like hydrogen charging tensile tests or slow strain rate tensile tests, which demonstrate a sharp decrease in strength and ductility with increasing hydrogen concentration [3,8,10]. Observation techniques allow for analysis of both macroscopic (e.g., white spots, blisters) and microscopic damage (micron- to nanoscale cracking, fracture surface features) [3,11]. Complex fracture modes exhibiting mixed brittle and ductile features can also be observed, particularly in advanced materials like high-entropy alloys [3].  

# 3. Mechanisms of Hydrogen Embrittlement  

Understanding the complex phenomena of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) necessitates a critical examination of the various proposed mechanisms by which hydrogen degrades the mechanical properties of metals.

While a single, universally accepted theory remains elusive, several dominant mechanisms have been established and extensively studied [8,29]. This section presents and critically evaluates these key mechanisms, including HydrogenEnhanced Decohesion (HEDE), Hydrogen-Enhanced Localized Plasticity (HELP), Adsorption-Induced Dislocation Emission (AIDE), Hydrogen-Enhanced Strain-Induced Vacancy (HESIV), Hydrogen-Induced Pressure Theory (HIPT), and hydride formation, among others [3,4,10,28,29].  

The theoretical foundations of these mechanisms vary significantly, reflecting different perspectives on the primary role of hydrogen in the fracture process. The HEDE mechanism posits that hydrogen weakens the cohesive strength of atomic bonds, particularly at interfaces like grain boundaries, making the material prone to brittle fracture under reduced stress [3,4,29]. In contrast, the HELP mechanism suggests that hydrogen enhances localized plastic deformation, primarily by facilitating dislocation motion near stress concentrations such as crack tips, ultimately promoting crack propagation [4,26,29]. The AIDE mechanism focuses on the role of hydrogen adsorbed on surfaces, which reduces surface energy and the barrier for dislocation emission from crack tips, leading to localized plasticity [26,27]. The HESIV mechanism highlights hydrogen's role in promoting the formation, stabilization, and aggregation of strain-induced vacancies, which subsequently coalesce into microcracks [3,4,27]. For certain susceptible metals like titanium and zirconium, brittle hydride formation is a primary mechanism, where hydrogen reacts chemically with the metal to form brittle phases that act as crack initiation sites [11,22]. The HIPT proposes that the accumulation of molecular hydrogen (or methane in steels) in internal voids and defects generates significant internal pressure, driving crack extension [2,27,29].​  

Experimental evidence and computational simulations provide support for aspects of each mechanism, although inconsistencies and limitations exist. For example, simulations often support the theoretical basis of HEDE and HELP [3,4,29], while experimental observations of fracture surfaces, localized deformation, and vacancy accumulation offer correlative evidence for HELP, HEDE, and HESIV, respectively [3,4,10]. The susceptibility of group IVB and VB metals to hydride formation is well documented [11,22].  

A critical comparison reveals that each mechanism may dominate under specific conditions depending on material properties, hydrogen concentration, temperature, stress state, and microstructure [29]. Furthermore, it is increasingly recognized that HE is often a result of the synergistic interplay between multiple mechanisms, rather than the action of a single one [4,10,27,28]. For instance, HELP-mediated HEDE models suggest an interaction where hydrogen-enhanced plasticity alters the stress state, favoring decohesion [27].  

Significant limitations and unresolved questions persist within each mechanism. The precise quantitative relationship between local hydrogen concentration and the degree of bond weakening (HEDE), the detailed interaction mechanisms between hydrogen and dislocations (HELP), the critical conditions for dislocation emission from surfaces (AIDE), and the kinetics of hydrogen-vacancy cluster formation and growth (HESIV) require further clarification. The interplay between these mechanisms and the conditions under which one becomes dominant over others remain active areas of research and debate. Future research directions involve refining theoretical models, conducting more sophisticated multi-scale simulations, and developing advanced experimental techniques to directly observe hydrogen-defect interactions and fracture processes at relevant scales, aiming towards a more comprehensive and predictive understanding of hydrogen embrittlement.​  

# 3.1 Hydrogen-Enhanced Decohesion (HEDE)  

The hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) mechanism, one of the prominent theories explaining hydrogen embrittlement (HE), posits that hydrogen reduces the cohesive strength of the metallic lattice or interfaces, making the material susceptible to brittle fracture under reduced tensile stress [3,4,28,29]. This concept was initially proposed by Pfeil et al. in 1926, suggesting that hydrogen's presence weakens interatomic forces, leading to atomic separation under lower stress [3,29]. Troiano further elaborated on this, proposing that hydrogen interacts with the electronic structure of transition metals, specifically entering the d-band, which increases local electron concentration and enhances repulsive forces between metal atoms, thereby reducing lattice cohesion [3]. This electronic perspective is supported by thermodynamic and first-principles simulations, which indicate that hydrogen's interaction with d-orbital electrons increases repulsive  

forces and reduces atomic bonding [4]. A more universal atomic-scale quantification mechanism suggests that the core of cohesion reduction lies in the increase of local electron density and the significant enhancement of Pauli repulsion, resulting in lattice expansion [4]. Consequently, hydrogen atoms penetrating the metal interior reduce the atomic bonding force between grains, decreasing overall toughness and ductility [35,36].​  

Evidence supporting the HEDE mechanism comes from various sources, including computational simulations and experimental observations of hydrogen-induced fracture phenomena. Molecular dynamics calculations have demonstrated that hydrogen atoms decrease the cohesive energy of grain boundaries, contributing to the propensity for intergranular fracture [25]. Similarly, first-principles simulations corroborate the theoretical basis of hydrogen weakening metallic bonds [4]. Experimentally, HEDE is often associated with brittle fracture surfaces, frequently exhibiting intergranular characteristics [10]. However, experimental observations do not always show clear intergranular fracture surfaces even when molecular dynamics suggests reduced grain boundary cohesive energy [25], highlighting the complexity of HE. Segregation of hydrogen to interfaces, such as those between inclusions and the weld metal, has been observed to weaken cohesive strength and promote crack initiation, providing direct support for the HEDE mechanism at these specific sites [6]. Research on high-strength aluminum alloys has also indicated that the co-segregation of magnesium and hydrogen to free surfaces provides a driving force for grain boundary embrittlement, with calculated embrittlement energy being significantly higher for grain boundaries compared to dispersoids or other phases [14]. In steel, hydrogen accumulation, particularly around microstructural defects, significantly weakens interatomic bonding forces, reducing cohesion and increasing the likelihood of crack formation and propagation in these weakened regions [26,27]. Hydrogen enrichment at the crack tip and adsorption on microcrack surfaces are also observed, leading to crack initiation and propagation [22]. Furthermore, hydrogen reduces the interatomic bonding strength within martensite grains and at martensite/ferrite interfaces in welded joints, promoting microcrack initiation and propagation [13].​  

The degree of metallic interatomic force reduction is quantitatively related to the local hydrogen concentration (C). The locally critical cohesive stress $\big ( \sigma _ { \mathfrak { c } } \mathsf { c } \mathsf { H } , \big )$ decreases with increasing hydrogen concentration, as described by the relationship:  

$$
\sigma _ { c H } = \sigma _ { c 0 } - \beta C
$$  

where $\mathtt { \sigma } _ { \mathtt { ( C 0 , \mathtt { \sigma } } }$ is the critical cohesive stress in the absence of hydrogen, and $\beta$ is a parameter related to the loss of cohesive stress due to hydrogen [29]. This equation highlights the critical role of local hydrogen accumulation in promoting decohesion. Potential regions for such hydrogen accumulation include the dislocation shielding region at the crack tip, sites of maximum hydrostatic stress, and grain and phase boundaries, particularly near crack tips [29]. Hydrogen segregation to grain boundaries and other interfaces is crucial because these regions often represent paths of lower cohesive strength even without hydrogen, and their weakening by hydrogen can facilitate brittle fracture [35].​  

While the HEDE mechanism effectively explains the observed brittle fracture characteristics and the role of hydrogen in reducing bond strength, it has limitations in fully accounting for all aspects of hydrogen embrittlement. For example, the lack of clear intergranular fracture surfaces in some studies despite theoretical predictions of grain boundary weakening suggests that other factors or mechanisms may be concurrently active or dominant [25]. Furthermore, strategies that introduce chemical heterogeneity, such as Mn-rich regions in steel, have been shown to enhance local crack resistance by preventing hydrogen-induced microcracks from easily propagating. This implicitly acts as a countermeasure to the HEDE mechanism, creating barriers that localized decohesion struggles to overcome [1]. This suggests a potential interplay between HEDE and other factors that influence crack propagation resistance, where microstructural features can modify or mitigate the effects of hydrogen-induced bond weakening. The HEDE mechanism provides a foundational understanding of hydrogen's impact on material cohesion but its manifestation in macroscopic fracture behavior is influenced by complex interactions with microstructure, stress state, and hydrogen distribution, which are also considered in other HE mechanisms.  

# 3.2 Hydrogen-Enhanced Localized Plasticity (HELP)  

The Hydrogen-Enhanced Localized Plasticity (HELP) mechanism posits that hydrogen atoms facilitate the movement of dislocations within the metal lattice—particularly in areas of stress concentration such as crack tips—thereby leading to enhanced localized plastic deformation [2,4,25,26,27,29,33]. This increase in localized plasticity can promote the initiation and propagation of cracks, contributing to hydrogen embrittlement [2,4,13,25,26,27,33].​  

Experimental evidence supporting HELP includes observations of hydrogen-induced localized plasticity in various metals such as aluminum, nickel, and austenitic stainless steel [3]. Beachem first observed this phenomenon in 1972 during stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen-assisted cracking of quenched and tempered steel, suggesting a relationship between  

hydrogen-assisted cracking and solute hydrogen promoting dislocation motion [3,29]. Fracture surfaces characteristic of hydrogen-assisted fracture have been observed to exhibit tear ridges and slip lines, indicating localized plastic flow [10,29]. Moreover, microstructural designs incorporating soft phases—such as austenite islands in a hard matrix—have been shown to promote crack tip blunting through localized plasticity, a process potentially influenced by the localized suppression of martensitic transformation in specific zones [1].​  

The widely accepted view under the HELP framework is that hydrogen enhances dislocation mobility. Proposed mechanisms include hydrogen causing a local reduction in shear stress [28], shielding the elastic interaction between dislocations as observed in TEM studies [4], changing the core structure of dislocations, and reducing the energy barrier for their movement according to first-principles and molecular dynamics calculations [4]. Hydrogen accumulation around dislocations—often accelerated by dislocation transport—is thought to enhance local strain and disrupt the crystal structure [28], leading to reduced resistance to dislocation motion, promoting local slip and premature material failure [3,7]. Hydrogen-induced enhanced dislocation motion facilitates local dislocation pileups, which contribute to premature failure [29].​  

However, contradictory findings regarding the effect of hydrogen on dislocation motion exist. Atomic simulations by Song et al., studying hydrogen-induced localized plasticity, suggested that hydrogen could form a Cottrell atmosphere around moving dislocations, thereby hindering their motion [3]. These simulations also indicated that under external load, the stacking structure remained independent of hydrogen presence, suggesting the hydrogen atmosphere did not impede dislocation action [3]. These simulation results contradict the primary mechanisms proposing hydrogen-enhanced dislocation mobility and highlight the need for further investigation to fully understand the complex interaction between hydrogen and dislocations [3].  

While the HELP mechanism emphasizes the significant role of plasticity in hydrogen-assisted fracture—distinguishing it from mechanisms like Hydrogen-Enhanced DEcohesion (HEDE), which focus on the reduction of cohesive strength [29]—a comprehensive understanding of hydrogen embrittlement likely requires considering the interplay between multiple mechanisms. For instance, combining HELP and HEDE theories has been suggested to provide a more reasonable explanation for Hydrogen-Induced Cracking (HIC) phenomena [4]. The provided digests offer limited detailed information regarding the specific quantitative influence of hydrogen concentration, temperature, and stress state on the extent of localized plasticity as described by the HELP mechanism, indicating areas for further detailed study and synthesis.  

# 3.3 Adsorption-Induced Dislocation Emission (AIDE)  

The Adsorption-Induced Dislocation Emission (AIDE) mechanism proposes that the detrimental effects of hydrogen on mechanical properties arise from its adsorption onto metal surfaces, particularly at stress concentrations such as crack tips [26,27]. According to this theory, adsorbed hydrogen atoms decrease the binding energy between surface atoms [26,27]. This reduction in surface energy and atomic bond strength lowers the energetic barrier for the formation and emission of dislocations from the crack tip [26,27]. The subsequent generation and movement of these dislocations are hypothesized to enhance the local plastic deformation at the crack tip [27]. This increased local plasticity can manifest as crack tip blunting, which, paradoxically in the context of embrittlement, is suggested as a mode of crack advance under cyclic loading or specific conditions where repeated blunting and resharpening lead to overall crack extension [32,33].​  

While the AIDE mechanism provides a theoretical framework explaining how surface hydrogen can influence dislocation behavior and crack propagation, the provided digests do not contain specific experimental evidence, such as detailed observations of crack tip blunting kinetics in hydrogen environments or quantitative measurements directly linking hydrogen adsorption parameters to dislocation emission rates. Furthermore, the factors influencing hydrogen adsorption at crack tips, such as the roles of hydrogen partial pressure, surface cleanliness, and electrochemical potential, are not detailed in the provided materials. Similarly, an evaluation of the inherent limitations of the AIDE mechanism and its potential interplay or competition with other proposed hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms is not available within the scope of the provided digests.​  

# 3.4 Hydrogen-Enhanced Strain-Induced Vacancies (HESIV)  

The Hydrogen-Enhanced Strain-Induced Vacancy (HESIV) mechanism, initially proposed by Nagumo et al., posits a direct role for hydrogen in the formation and evolution of defects within a material under stress [3,29]. According to this theory, hydrogen increases the density of vacancies and significantly promotes their aggregation, particularly when the material undergoes plastic deformation or experiences tensile strain [3,25,26,27].  

Under strain, vacancies and nanoscale voids naturally accumulate within the metal lattice [26,27]. The ingress of hydrogen into the material stabilizes these nanometer-scale vacancies, potentially through the formation of hydrogen-vacancy complexes (H-vacancies) [4,29]. This stabilization and the presence of dissolved hydrogen promote the growth and aggregation of these vacancies and microvoids [4,26,27]. The accelerated formation and growth of these microvoids [25,29] rapidly leads to their connection, which manifests as microcrack formation and subsequent hydrogen-induced fracture [4,27]. This process reduces the material's resistance to ductile crack propagation, ultimately causing ductile fracture [3].  

Evidence supporting the HESIV mechanism has been gathered through various experimental techniques. Takai K et al. utilized the positron annihilation method (PAM), also referred to as Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS), demonstrating that the positron annihilation time was longer in hydrogen-charged samples compared to non-hydrogencharged counterparts [4,29]. Combined with thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS) which confirmed the defect type as vacancies, this experimental approach provided direct evidence that hydrogen ingress increases the internal vacancy concentration within the material [4]. Furthermore, studies on ultra-fine grained iron have shown enhanced formation of deformation-induced vacancies in the presence of hydrogen, supporting the proposed role of hydrogen in accelerating vacancy creation and aggregation during plastic deformation [25]. Molecular dynamics simulations have also provided theoretical support for hydrogen accelerating strain-induced vacancy formation and stabilizing clusters [29].  

The HESIV mechanism is particularly relevant as it offers a theoretical framework that explicitly explains the formation, growth, and connection of micropores [3]. This aligns with experimental observations of micropore phenomena commonly observed on the fracture surfaces of hydrogen-charged tensile specimens [3], and high-resolution observations of nanovoids on fracture surfaces may serve as potential indicators of the HESIV mechanism's contribution to the failure process [10].​  

# 3.5 Hydride Formation  

Hydrogen-induced embrittlement in certain metallic materials is significantly driven by the formation of brittle hydride phases. This process occurs when susceptible metals chemically react with hydrogen—either from the environment or internal sources—leading to the transformation of the metal matrix into a hydride [22]. The resultant hydride is inherently brittle and typically possesses weak bonding forces with the surrounding metal matrix, along with differing elastic and plastic properties compared to the matrix. These discrepancies in mechanical properties between the hydride phase and the matrix facilitate the formation of brittle fractures under applied stress [11].  

The susceptibility to hydride formation varies significantly among different metals. Metals from Group IVB (e.g., Ti, Zr, Hf) and Group VB (e.g., V, Nb, Ta) are particularly prone to forming hydrides [11,29]. This high susceptibility is attributed to their strong chemical affinity for hydrogen and the large bond energies involved in hydride formation [22,29]. For instance, despite the low hydrogen solubility in α-titanium alloys at room temperature, α-titanium exhibits a strong chemical affinity for hydrogen, readily forming brittle titanium hydride phases [22].  

Factors influencing the formation of hydrides include hydrogen concentration and the chemical affinity between the metal and hydrogen [22,29]. At high hydrogen concentrations, hydrogen directly combines with specific metals, leading to the spontaneous formation of hydrides [29]. This transformation alters the alloy, causing it to lose its original mechanical properties, such as strength and stiffness [22]. External factors such as temperature and stress state also play crucial roles, particularly in the diffusion and accumulation of hydrogen, which in turn influences hydride nucleation and growth [38].​  

The presence of brittle hydride phases acts as preferential sites for crack initiation. Under external forces, these brittle hydride regions often become stress concentration points and serve as fracture sources, promoting brittle fracture [22]. The subsequent propagation of cracks occurs along or through these brittle hydride regions, leading to the overall embrittlement and potential failure of the material [32,33,38].​

Beyond the widely discussed mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement (HE), several alternative theories have been proposed to explain specific aspects of hydrogen-induced damage in metals. These mechanisms, while perhaps less universally applicable or integrated, offer valuable insights into the complexity of hydrogen interactions within materials [3,4].  

One such theory is the Hydrogen Pressure Theory (HIPT). This mechanism posits that hydrogen atoms diffuse into the metal matrix and accumulate at internal defects such as micro-voids, inclusions, or cracks [27,29]. At these sites, hydrogen atoms combine to form molecular hydrogen ( $H _ { 2 }$ ​ ) [2,29]. Since $H _ { 2 }$ ​ molecules have low mobility within the solid lattice, they become trapped, leading to a significant increase in local gas pressure within the defect volume [27,29]. When this internal pressure exceeds the local yield strength or fracture toughness of the surrounding metal, it promotes plastic deformation, defect formation (such as white spots), blistering, and crack propagation [2,11,27,29]. A specific manifestation of HIPT in steels involves the reaction of hydrogen with carbides, forming methane ( $C H _ { 4 }$ ) [22,23,24]. Methane molecules, also unable to diffuse out of the lattice, accumulate particularly at grain boundaries, generating high local pressures that induce stress concentration, microcracks, or blistering [22,23,24]. For this methane-induced damage (often termed hydrogen corrosion at high temperatures and pressures) to cause significant embrittlement, the methane bubbles must nucleate on inclusions and reach a sufficient density and distribution, preferentially along grain boundaries [22]. Research also includes modeling of hydrogen molecule formation specifically within nanovoids, reinforcing the HIPT concept [9].​  

Another proposed mechanism is Nano-Void Coalescence (NVC). Proposed by Neeraj et al. based on studies of ferritic steel, the NVC mechanism describes the fracture process in hydrogen-embrittled materials through a four-stage sequence [3]. The first stage involves plastic deformation at the crack tip, leading to the formation of a dislocation plastic zone [3]. In the second stage, a region with a high concentration of hydrogen forms within a strong plastic zone near the crack tip [3]. The third stage is characterized by the generation and accumulation of excess vacancies within this hydrogen-induced plastic deformation zone, with these vacancies being stabilized by the presence of hydrogen [3]. Finally, in the fourth stage, nanovoids nucleate within this region, grow, and eventually coalesce, leading to macroscopic material failure or fracture [3]. The NVC mechanism is considered to represent a combined effect of several other mechanisms, suggesting a complex interplay of processes leading to failure at the nanoscale [29].  

Additionally, Gong et al. have proposed a mechanism related to low-energy dislocation nanostructures [3,4]. They suggest that these specific dislocation structures can act as significant hydrogen absorption sites, accumulating large amounts of hydrogen [3,4]. This high hydrogen content can then lead to severe misorientation within the dislocation nanostructure, ultimately inducing cracking [3]. Other concepts include the hydrogen reduction of surface energy, where adsorbed or diffused hydrogen lowers the energy required for crack propagation [27], and the cathodic hydrogen absorption theory, which highlights how certain impurity elements can facilitate atomic hydrogen entry and subsequent grain boundary embrittlement [22]. The diversity of these proposed mechanisms underscores the multifaceted nature of hydrogen embrittlement, indicating that the dominant mechanism may vary depending on the specific material, environmental conditions, and stress states involved [8].  

# 4. Hydrogen Trapping in Metals  

![](images/569d01db4561f61126ddb247dc855a8bb0c2cf6b3ce4fb0312d0ff6650a6c2d4.jpg)  

Hydrogen trapping refers to the phenomenon where hydrogen atoms accumulate at specific microstructural features and defects within metallic materials, deviating from their equilibrium distribution in the lattice interstices [2,4,10,11,21,26,27,28,29]. These trapping sites critically influence hydrogen diffusion, distribution, and ultimately, the material's susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) [4,10].​  

Hydrogen traps are typically classified based on their dimensionality, including point defects (e.g., vacancies, solute atoms), line defects (e.g., dislocations), planar defects (e.g., grain boundaries, phase boundaries), and volumetric defects (e.g., precipitates, inclusions, nanovoids) [2,21,26,27]. Another key classification is based on the hydrogen-trap binding energy ( $ { E _ { \mathrm { b } } }$ ), which determines the trap's reversibility [4,10,11,26,28,29,31]. Reversible traps, characterized by lower binding energies (typically $< 6 0 k J / \mathsf { m o l } )$ , include dislocations, grain boundaries, and coherent precipitates. Hydrogen can readily detrap from these sites, re-entering the lattice under external stimuli [4,11,25,28,29]. Conversely, irreversible traps possess higher binding energies $( > 6 0 \mathrm { \ k J / m o l } )$ , encompassing features such as carbides, inclusions, incoherent precipitates, and specific vacancies within precipitates [4,11,18,19,20,26,28,29]. Hydrogen is strongly bound to these sites and is not easily released at typical service temperatures [4].​  

The presence and characteristics of hydrogen traps fundamentally alter hydrogen distribution and mobility within the material [2,10]. Hydrogen atoms partition between lattice interstitial sites and trap sites, with the equilibrium concentration in traps $( C _ { \mathrm { T } } )$ relative to the lattice $( C _ { \mathrm { { L } } }$ ) being dependent on the binding energy $( E _ { \mathrm { { b } } } )$ ) and temperature $( T )$ , as described by the equation:​  

$$
K = \frac { C _ { \mathrm { T } } } { C _ { \mathrm { L } } } = \mathrm { e } ^ { E _ { \mathrm { b } } / R T } ,
$$  

where $K$ is the equilibrium constant and $R$ is the gas constant [10,26,27]. Higher trap density and stronger binding energies lead to greater hydrogen accumulation at trap sites, resulting in heterogeneous local hydrogen concentrations [6,10]. Trapping effectively reduces the amount of mobile hydrogen in the lattice, thereby influencing the apparent hydrogen diffusion and permeation rates [4]. The distinction between trapped hydrogen and difusiblehydrogen (lattice hydrogen plus reversibly trapped hydrogen) is critical, as diffusible hydrogen is primarily responsible for dynamic HE processes [4]. Applied and residual stresses also play a significant role by promoting hydrogen accumulation at trap sites and in regions of tensile hydrostatic stress [6,15,29].  

The influence of hydrogen trapping on HE susceptibility is complex and depends on the trap nature, density, distribution, and capacity, as well as the interplay with local stress conditions [4,10,26]. Reversible traps, while potentially slowing overall diffusion, can concentrate hydrogen at critical locations under stress, such as crack tips or dislocation pile-ups, thereby exacerbating HE [4]. Conversely, irreversible traps with high capacity can mitigate HE by effectively immobilizing hydrogen, preventing it from reaching fracture-critical sites [1,11,12,18,20]. However, if irreversible traps are located in highly stressed regions or represent cleavage-prone phases, they can also serve as hydrogen-saturated crack initiation sites [2]. Therefore, understanding and controlling the type, density, and distribution of hydrogen traps through material design and processing is crucial for enhancing HE resistance [1,26].​  

# 4.1 Types of Hydrogen Trapping Sites  

Hydrogen atoms in metallic materials are highly mobile and tend to accumulate at specific lattice imperfections and microstructural features, collectively known as hydrogen trapping sites [21,26,27]. These traps significantly influence hydrogen diffusion, distribution, and ultimately, the susceptibility of the material to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). Traps can be broadly classified based on their dimensionality – point defects (e.g., vacancies, solute atoms), line defects (e.g., dislocations), planar defects (e.g., grain boundaries, phase boundaries), and volumetric defects (e.g., precipitates, inclusions, nanovoids) [26,27]. Another common classification distinguishes between physical traps (vacancies, dislocations, grain boundaries) and chemical traps (solute atoms, precipitates, inclusions, interfaces) [32].​  

A critical distinction in the characteristics of hydrogen traps is their binding energy $( E _ { \mathrm { { b } } } )$ with hydrogen atoms, which determines whether they are considered reversible or irreversible [4,11,29]. Reversible traps, such as interstitial sites, dislocations, lath boundaries, grain boundaries, and coherent precipitates, exhibit relatively low binding energies, typically below $6 0 k J / \mathsf { m o l }$ (equivalent to approximately $0 . 2 \mathrm { - } 0 . 5 \mathrm { e V } .$ ) [4,11,29]. Hydrogen atoms are weakly bound to these sites and can readily diffuse back into the lattice under stress or thermal activation. This reversible trapping behavior is often implicated in promoting HE by concentrating hydrogen at sites of high stress, such as crack tips or dislocation pile-ups [4].  

In contrast, irreversible traps possess higher binding energies, generally exceeding $6 0 \mathrm { k J / m o l }$ (approximately 0.8–0.95 eV) [4,11,29]. These include carbides, inclusions, incoherent precipitates, and specifically, carbides or nitrides of active elements like V, Ti, and Nb [11,29]. Hydrogen atoms are strongly retained at irreversible traps and are not easily released at room temperature without external stimuli [4]. Such traps can be beneficial if they effectively immobilize hydrogen away from critical fracture paths, thereby mitigating HE [11]. However, if irreversible traps are cleavage-prone or located in areas of high stress concentration, they can also serve as crack initiation sites when saturated with hydrogen. Precipitated phases, for instance, show a wide range of binding energies (10 to $1 5 0 k J / \mathsf { m o l }$ ), indicating that their nature (coherent/incoherent, composition, size) dictates their behavior as either reversible or irreversible traps [26].​  

Specific trapping mechanisms and their characteristics have been investigated across various materials and microstructures. Dislocations and grain boundaries are widely recognized trapping sites, with direct observation techniques like cryogenic transfer atom probe tomography validating hydrogen accumulation at carbon-rich dislocations and grain boundaries in steel [4]. The increased density of grain boundaries in ultra-fine grained iron leads to a higher total hydrogen content in the material [7,25].  

Interfaces, particularly between precipitates and the matrix, represent complex trapping environments. Research indicates that hydrogen trapping at these interfaces is strongly influenced by the local atomic structure and strain state [17,19]. Specifically, carbon or sulfur vacancies on the precipitate surface act as potent trapping sites [17,19]. Furthermore, tensile strain fields in the matrix adjacent to the interface enhance hydrogen attraction, while compressive strain fields tend to repel hydrogen [19].  

Within precipitates themselves, intrinsic defects can serve as traps. For instance, carbon vacancies within the vanadium carbide (VC) lattice are identified as significant hydrogen trapping sites [18,20]. The trapping ability is amplified when multiple carbon vacancies are situated adjacently, and the distance between vacancies affects the electron localization function and thus the trapping strength [18]. In aluminum alloys, dispersoids like Al3Zr and phases like S phase Al2CuMg act as traps, with hydrogen showing a preference for the interior of dispersoids and a slightly higher concentration at their interfaces [14].​  

Volumetric defects, including inclusions and nanovoids, also play a crucial role. In steel weldments, both strip-shaped and spherical inclusions are trapping sites [6]. The morphology and orientation of these inclusions relative to the hydrogen diffusion path significantly influence their impact on hydrogen behavior [6]. Nanovoids in metals like tungsten trap hydrogen through adsorption on their internal surfaces, presenting distinct energy levels depending on the adsorption site [9].​  

Other microstructural features identified as traps include Mn-rich regions in steel, acting as chemical traps that alter hydrogen distribution [1,12], and specific interfaces formed during phase transformations, such as carbide/ferrite interfaces in pearlite, acicular/lath interfaces in bainite ferrite, and martensite/austenite interfaces [2]. These interfaces are potential trapping sites due to differences in their chemical and mechanical properties compared to the surrounding matrix [1].  

The formation and distribution of these traps are intricately linked to material processing and composition. Alloying elements influence the formation of solute traps and precipitate phases [1,11]. Heat treatment controls phase transformations, precipitation kinetics, and the density of dislocations and vacancies. Plastic deformation introduces dislocations. Welding introduces specific inclusion distributions and unique microstructures in the heat-affected zone and weld metal with characteristic trapping sites [2,6]. Microstructural parameters, along with the research methods used for characterization, contribute to variations observed in hydrogen trap binding energies and capacities [26].  

Evaluating the effectiveness of traps in mitigating HE requires considering both their binding energy and capacity. While reversible traps can exacerbate HE by concentrating hydrogen at stress points, irreversible traps can be beneficial by immobilizing hydrogen. High capacity irreversible traps are generally desired for improved HE resistance. For example, engineered carbon vacancies in carbides demonstrate strong, potentially beneficial trapping [18,20]. Understanding the interplay between trap type, density, distribution, and their interaction with applied stress is crucial for designing materials with enhanced HE resistance.  

# 4.2 Influence of Trapping on Hydrogen Distribution and Mobility  

![](images/eafcc7148c512b56a96ae4357bcbbc66d77aa3b8703817e48b24688604875ceb.jpg)  

Hydrogen trapping fundamentally alters its distribution and mobility within metallic microstructures, leading to significant local variations in hydrogen concentration [2,10]. The interaction between hydrogen and trap sites is governed by the trap density and the binding energy $\left( E _ { \mathrm { { b } } } \right)$ , which quantifies the strength of the trap’s ability to capture hydrogen [27]. The equilibrium concentration of hydrogen in traps $( C _ { \mathrm { T } }$ ) relative to that in lattice interstices $( C _ { \mathrm { { L } } } )$ at temperature $T$ is described by the relationship  

$$
K = \frac { C _ { \mathrm { T } } } { C _ { \mathrm { L } } } = \mathrm { e } ^ { E _ { \mathrm { b } } / R T } ,
$$  

where $K$ is the reaction equilibrium constant and $R$ is the gas constant [27]. Higher trap density and stronger binding energy promote greater hydrogen accumulation at trap sites, creating heterogeneous concentration profiles within the material [10].  

Various microstructural features act as hydrogen traps, each with distinct trapping characteristics. Grain boundaries, for instance, are significant trapping sites, with higher hydrogen concentrations observed at grain boundaries compared to grain interiors [7]. Materials with smaller grain sizes exhibit a higher hydrogen concentration due to the increased grain boundary area [25]. Precipitates and their interfaces are also potent traps; studies using techniques like Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM) reveal hydrogen trapping behavior at individual non-coherent nano-precipitate interfaces, demonstrating that atomic-scale structure and chemical characteristics—such as carbon/sulfur vacancies and local strain fields—influence hydrogen trapping [17,19]. For example, interfaces with tensile strain fields and vacancies tend to trap hydrogen, while those with compressive fields may repel it [19]. Carbon vacancies within vanadium carbide (VC) precipitates act as strong traps, and hydrogen can diffuse through connected vacancy networks, facilitating capture within the carbides [18,20]. Similarly, $A l _ { 3 } Z r$ dispersoids and solute-modified grain boundaries effectively trap hydrogen in aluminum alloys [14]. Inclusions also serve as trapping sites, with hydrogen accumulation being particularly high when inclusions are oriented parallel to the diffusion path [6]. Impurity atoms like oxygen and nitrogen in iron can significantly reduce the hydrogen diffusion coefficient through trapping effects [11]. Nanovoids can trap hydrogen, with complex interactions governing atom configurations and molecule formation within them [9].​  

The presence and nature of hydrogen traps critically influence the apparent hydrogen diffusion and permeation rates [4]. Traps effectively reduce the amount of freely mobile hydrogen in the lattice, slowing down its overall transport through the material. Traps are often categorized as reversible or irreversible. Reversible traps allow hydrogen atoms to detrap relatively easily and continue diffusion through the lattice, while irreversible traps, such as certain inclusions and large-angle grain boundaries, tend to hold hydrogen more strongly, leading to significant accumulation [4]. The distinction between trapped and difusiblehydrogen (often considered lattice hydrogen plus reversibly trapped hydrogen) is crucial, as diffusible hydrogen is widely believed to be the primary species responsible for hydrogen-induced fracture (HIC) and delayed fracture, especially at room temperature [4].  

Trapping plays a dual role in hydrogen embrittlement (HE), potentially delaying or accelerating damage by controlling the availability of mobile hydrogen at critical stress concentration sites, such as crack tips. While overall hydrogen content is important, the local concentration of difusiblehydrogen at these critical locations dictates the kinetics and severity of HE. Strong, irreversible traps can sequester hydrogen, preventing it from reaching critical sites and thus potentially mitigating HE under certain conditions. Conversely, reversible traps might slow down diffusion but can also serve as local reservoirs that release hydrogen under stress or changing conditions, supplying mobile hydrogen to crack tips. Furthermore, the trap sites themselves (e.g., interfaces, inclusions) can act as crack initiation points if sufficient hydrogen accumulates [2]. Material design strategies leverage controlled trapping to enhance HE resistance; for example, creating Mn-rich regions designed to trap hydrogen can impede the propagation of hydrogen-induced microcracks by stabilizing the austenite phase and enhancing local plasticity [1,12].​  

Stress significantly influences hydrogen distribution and accumulation at trap sites [15]. Hydrogen atoms are subject to stress-induced diffusion, moving towards regions of higher hydrostatic tensile stress. The local hydrogen concentration $( C )$ is exponentially dependent on the hydrostatic stress $\left( \sigma _ { \mathrm { h } } \right)$ and the partial molar volume of hydrogen $( \overline { { V _ { \mathrm { H } } } } )$ :​  

$$
C = C _ { 0 } \exp \left( \frac { \sigma _ { \mathrm { h } } \overline { { V _ { \mathrm { H } } } } } { R T } \right) ,
$$  

where $C _ { 0 }$ ​ is the average hydrogen concentration [29]. Tensile stress, even in the absence of significant plastic deformation, can increase the amount of dislocation-trapped hydrogen [15]. Dislocations themselves can transport hydrogen (dislocationinduced hydrogen immigration) if their velocity $( V ^ { * } )$ is below a critical value $( V _ { \mathrm { c } } )$ , influencing hydrogen redistribution, particularly during plastic deformation [29]. Residual stress also contributes to promoting hydrogen accumulation at trap sites like inclusions [6]. Thus, the combined effects of applied and residual stress, mediated by different trapping sites, govern the highly localized hydrogen concentrations that are critical for HE initiation and propagation.​

Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in metallic materials is a complex phenomenon governed by the intricate interplay among material properties, environmental conditions, and the applied or residual stress state [10,35]. Understanding these interactions is crucial for predicting HE susceptibility and developing effective mitigation strategies.  

Material properties, including chemical composition, crystal structure, microstructure, and mechanical strength, fundamentally dictate how a metal interacts with hydrogen [4,16,29,31,33,36]. Differences in crystal structure, such as between BCC ferritic and FCC austenitic steels, significantly affect hydrogen solubility and diffusion rates [4,7]. Alloying elements can influence hydrogen entry by forming passivation layers or affecting hydrogen trapping behavior, with some elements like C, P, and S generally increasing susceptibility while others like Ni, Al, Mo, V, and Ti can improve resistance by stabilizing carbides or promoting beneficial microstructures [11,18,20,26,29,31]. Microstructural features such as phases (with martensite being highly susceptible), grain boundaries, precipitates, and inclusions serve as hydrogen trapping sites, influencing local hydrogen concentration and susceptibility to cracking [4,6,13,17,19,24,25,29,34]. High-strength steels (HSS) and advanced high-strength steels (AHSS), often characterized by high defect densities and hardened microstructures, are particularly susceptible to HE [2,8,10,26,27,33]. Novel materials like high-entropy alloys show varying responses, with some exhibiting promising HE resistance linked to their unique atomic structure and defect interactions [3].​  

Environmental conditions critically influence the availability and entry of hydrogen into the metal [4,31,32,33]. Hydrogen partial pressure directly impacts the chemical potential driving hydrogen uptake [2,4]. Temperature affects hydrogen diffusion kinetics and solubility [4]. The presence of moisture and corrosive species, particularly $H _ { 2 } S$ in sour environments, promotes hydrogen generation through corrosion reactions, leading to increased hydrogen ingress and the risk of hydrogeninduced cracking (HIC) [4,8,23,24,31,35,36]. Electrochemical processes, such as cathodic protection or electroplating, can also introduce hydrogen [16].  

The stress state significantly affects hydrogen distribution and accumulation within the material [22,31,35]. Tensile stress, whether applied or residual, enhances hydrogen accumulation at various trapping sites—such as crack tips, grain  

boundaries, and precipitate interfaces—accelerating crack initiation and propagation [1,6,8,13,15,16,17,22,35]. Stress gradients drive hydrogen diffusion from regions of low stress to high stress [4]. The total hydrogen diffusion flux (J) is the sum of the concentration gradient flux ( $\left[ J _ { c } \right]$ and the stress gradient flux ( $\mid J _ { \sigma } \mid$ [4]. Hydrogen tends to accumulate at stress concentrations, such as notches and defects, leading to localized fracture when a critical hydrogen level is reached [13,15,29,35]. Compressive stress, conversely, tends to impede hydrogen accumulation at trapping sites, suggesting a potential for mitigation [6]. The synergistic effect of hydrogen content and stress means that higher hydrogen concentrations reduce the critical stress required for cracking [2].  

The susceptibility to HE arises from the complex interactions among these factors [4]. For instance, a material's inherent microstructure and defect density (material properties) determine the available trapping sites, which are then filled by hydrogen entering from the environment (environmental conditions). The presence of tensile stress (stress state) drives hydrogen to accumulate preferentially at critical locations like crack tips or phase interfaces, where fracture initiates at lower stress levels than would be required in the absence of hydrogen. The relative importance of each factor varies significantly depending on the specific scenario; for example, in high-pressure hydrogen gas pipelines, environmental hydrogen pressure and material strength become paramount [2], while in sour service environments the environmental chemistry promoting hydrogen entry is a primary concern—exacerbated by material properties (e.g., a susceptible microstructure in weld zones) and tensile stresses (e.g., residual stress from welding or applied loads) [6,13,24]. Higher strength materials are generally more sensitive to HE, making the control of hydrogen content and stress particularly critica [2,33].​  

Based on the collected information, minimizing HE risk requires a multi-faceted approach involving the strategic manipulation of these influencing factors [26]. This includes selecting materials with inherent HE resistance, optimized composition (e.g., controlling detrimental elements and adding beneficial ones) and microstructure (e.g., favorable phases, controlled grain size, and beneficial precipitates and grain boundary character) [26]. It also necessitates controlling the service environment to minimize hydrogen uptake by avoiding or mitigating exposure to hydrogen gas, moisture, and corrosive species like $H _ { 2 } S$ —potentially through the application of coatings [8,24,26]. Furthermore, managing the stress state is vital, which involves minimizing tensile residual stresses through appropriate processing and controlling applied loads to avoid high stress concentrations in susceptible areas [16,26]. The development of hydrogen-resistant grain boundaries and the introduction of dispersed, reversible hydrogen traps can also be effective strategies for mitigating internal hydrogen concentration and its deleterious effects [26].​  

# 5.1 Material Properties  

The susceptibility of metallic materials to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is fundamentally dictated by their intrinsic material properties, including chemical composition, crystal structure, microstructure, and mechanical strength. Different classes of metallic alloys exhibit varying degrees of resistance to hydrogen damage. For instance, comparative studies reveal that ferritic stainless steels, possessing a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, demonstrate higher susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement compared to austenitic stainless steels, characterized by a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, under similar hydrogen charging conditions [7]. This difference is attributed, in part, to the higher hydrogen solubility and slower diffusion rate typically observed in the austenitic phase relative to the ferritic or martensitic phases [4]. Beyond steels, other alloys like nickel and titanium alloys are also recognized as susceptible to HE [16]. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) represent a promising class with potentially superior HE resistance. CoCrFeMnNi HEA, for example, showed significantly lower plastic loss $( 5 \% )$ ) compared to 304 $( 6 1 \% )$ and 316L $( 2 7 \% )$ ) stainless steels under the same hydrogen charging conditions, despite having higher hydrogen content [3]. This relative insensitivity is linked to a higher critical hydrogen concentration required to induce hydrogen-induced localized plasticity in this specific HEA [3]. Furthermore, hydrogen can induce nano-twinning in some HEAs, which can enhance mechanical properties, although embrittlement can occur at higher hydrogen concentrations [3].​  

The specific composition of an alloy, particularly the presence and concentration of various alloying elements, critically influences its interaction with hydrogen [29]. Certain elements can form dense passivation films on the surface, thereby hindering hydrogen penetration and reducing internal hydrogen content [26]. The amounts of elements like carbon (C), silicon (Si), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) are negatively correlated with HE resistance in steels, while additions of nickel (Ni), aluminum (Al), and molybdenum (Mo) can reduce HE susceptibility [29]. Higher carbon content generally increases the risk of hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC), whereas low-carbon steels are less prone to this damage [31,35,36]. Low-carbon steels that are fully spheroidized are recommended to mitigate hydrogen attack [11]. Elements such as vanadium (V) and titanium (Ti) can improve HE resistance by stabilizing carbon, reducing susceptibility to hydrogen attack and white spot formation [11]. The role of carbon vacancies associated with vanadium carbide has also been highlighted as crucial in controlling hydrogen trapping and improving the HE resistance of high-strength steels [18,20]. Elements like chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) are noted to increase hydrogen sensitivity in high-strength steels [31,35,36]. Strategic alloying and processing can also create beneficial chemical heterogeneity; for example, introducing manganese (Mn)-rich regions can enhance local crack resistance and impede hydrogen-induced crack propagation [1,12].  

Microstructure plays a pivotal role in hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility [29]. The specific phases present and their morphology significantly influence hydrogen diffusion and trapping behavior. Martensitic structures are typically the most susceptible to HE, followed by bainite and pearlite, with austenite exhibiting the lowest sensitivity [4,29]. Martensite's higher susceptibility is linked to its increased density of grain boundaries and dislocation defects [4]. Within steel microstructures, banded ferrite/pearlite configurations are considered detrimental, as their interfaces act as strong hydrogen trapping sites, increasing HIC sensitivity [4]. Conversely, acicular or polygonal ferrite can enhance toughness and inhibit crack propagation [4]. The susceptibility of bainite depends on its morphology, with lath bainite demonstrating high hydrogen trapping capability [4]. Grain size also affects HE; surprisingly, smaller grain sizes achieved through severe plastic deformation have been shown to increase HE susceptibility in pure iron despite the accompanying grain refinement strengthening [25]. Grain boundaries themselves can act as hydrogen traps, and their character (e.g., high-angle vs. low-angle boundaries) and associated carbides influence HE behavior [34]. The presence and nature of precipitates are also critical. Studies on highstrength low-alloy martensitic steel highlight how the type and distribution of nano-precipitates affect hydrogen trapping and HE susceptibility [17]. The interfaces between precipitates and the matrix, especially when associated with carbon/sulfur vacancies and elastic tensile strain fields, are potent hydrogen trapping sites, whereas compressive strain fields can lead to hydrogen repulsion [19]. Inclusions within the matrix can function as either hydrogen traps or diffusion pathways [6]. The heterogeneity of microstructure, such as that found in weld zones, impacts hydrogen diffusion and can lead to localized areas of high susceptibility, like the incomplete phase transformation zone in laser-welded QP980 steel [6,13,24].​  

Hydrogen embrittlement poses significant challenges for high-strength steels (HSS) and advanced high-strength steels (AHSS), which are increasingly used in critical applications [10,26,27]. Materials with higher defect densities and hardened structures, characteristic of HSS, are inherently more susceptible to hydrogen-induced cracking [2]. The susceptibility of steels generally increases with strength level [33]. For example, steels with strength levels exceeding 830 MPa $( 1 2 0 \mathsf { k s i } )$ are prone to developing transverse cracks in the weld metal [8]. While higher yield strength can reduce dislocation-trapped hydrogen due to limited plastic deformation, the resulting higher hydrostatic stresses can promote the diffusion and segregation of hydrogen to tensile stress concentration points [15]. Sulfide stress cracking (SSC), a form of HE, is particularly common in high-hardness regions such as welded areas [24]. Addressing HE in HSS requires careful consideration of alloying, microstructure design (including precipitate control and beneficial heterogeneous structures), and processing routes to manage hydrogen uptake, diffusion, and trapping behavior [1,12,17,18,26].  

# 5.2 Environmental Conditions  

Environmental conditions exert a significant influence on hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility in metallic materials by governing hydrogen entry, diffusion, solubility, and trapping [4]. Key factors include hydrogen partial pressure, temperature, and the presence of moisture or corrosive species [4,31,32,33].  

The relationship between hydrogen partial pressure and HE susceptibility is well-established [4]. Generally, the sensitivity to hydrogen embrittlement increases with increasing hydrogen pressure [4]. This is attributed to the higher chemical potential of hydrogen in the environment at elevated pressures, leading to increased hydrogen uptake by the metal [2]. However, studies indicate the existence of a threshold hydrogen pressure or content beyond which the HE sensitivity may plateau [4]. The potential for HE is particularly relevant in applications involving high-pressure hydrogen gas [2], such as hydrogen infrastructure, necessitating careful control of hydrogen exposure in service environments [4]. Research has explored hydrogen uptake in line pipe steels under significant gaseous hydrogen pressures, illustrating the practical relevance of this factor [34].​  

Temperature plays a crucial role in influencing hydrogen diffusion kinetics, solubility, and trapping behavior within the metallic lattice [4]. Elevated temperatures generally increase the rate of hydrogen diffusion, potentially accelerating its transport to critical locations such as crack tips [4]. Hydrogen accumulation and, consequently, HE sensitivity are dependent on the filling rate of diffusible hydrogen at the crack tip [4]. While higher temperatures can increase diffusion, solubility may decrease. The interplay between these factors means that HE can be more severe within specific temperature ranges. For instance, a theoretical model identified a hydrogen embrittlement threshold temperature of $4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for X90 steel, with the temperature range of $0 { - } 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ being identified as particularly sensitive [4].  

The presence of moisture, H2S, and other contaminants in the service environment significantly impacts hydrogen entry into metals, often by promoting corrosion reactions [4]. Hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC), for example, typically occurs in aqueous solutions [31,35,36]. Wet H2S environments are particularly aggressive, as the reaction between H2S and the steel surface generates atomic hydrogen, which is then readily absorbed by the material, leading to embrittlement [23,24]. Avoiding moisture is therefore important in mitigating HE risks [8]. Hydrogen can also be introduced through electrochemical processes, such as cathodic protection or electroplating, or contact with maintenance chemicals [16]. Laboratory studies frequently utilize electrochemical charging in aqueous solutions (e.g., NaOH) to control and introduce hydrogen into samples, demonstrating the role of electrochemical potential and solution chemistry [7,17,25]. The charging current density and time directly affect the amount of hydrogen introduced and the resulting HE severity [7,13].​  

Specific environmental challenges are prominent in critical infrastructure, particularly hydrogen infrastructure and oil and gas pipelines [2,4]. The transportation and storage of high-pressure hydrogen pose direct risks of hydrogen ingress [2]. Simultaneously, pipelines operating in sour environments (containing H2S) face significant threats from corrosion-induced hydrogen entry and subsequent HIC [4,23,24]. Understanding and controlling these complex environmental interactions are paramount for ensuring the integrity and safety of these systems [4].  

# 5.3 Stress State  

The stress state is a critical factor influencing hydrogen diffusion, accumulation, and the manifestation of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in metals [22,31,35]. Mechanical stress can alter the internal microstructure and influence hydrogen behavior within the material [4,21].  

Tensile stress plays a significant role in promoting HE. Applied tensile stress and tensile residual stress both facilitate hydrogen accumulation at various trapping sites, including crack tips, inclusions, grain boundaries, and precipitate/matrix interfaces [1,6,13,15,17,22,35]. Specifically, tensile strain fields near the matrix can determine hydrogen trapping characteristics at precipitate/matrix interfaces [17]. Tensile loading has been shown to negligibly affect lattice hydrogen uptake but increase the amount of dislocation-trapped hydrogen [15]. This accumulation at stress concentration points accelerates crack initiation and propagation [1]. High tensile stress is identified as a contributing factor to hydrogen-induced cracking, and controlling residual stress levels can help avoid crack initiation by requiring higher minimum stress or longer times for initiation [8,16]. Micro-tensile testing reveals the influence of uniaxial tensile stress on embrittlement, often indicated by discontinuous yielding and sharp stress drops in stress–strain curves [25]. Furthermore, hydrogen content and stress act synergistically, with increasing hydrogen content lowering the critical threshold stress required for hydrogeninduced cracking [2].​  

Conversely, compressive stress has the potential to mitigate HE. Compressive stress has been observed to hinder hydrogen accumulation at trapping sites such as inclusions [6]. While the provided digests do not detail the specific application of compressive stress via surface treatments as suggested in the description [22], the general principle that compressive stress impedes hydrogen accumulation at critical locations suggests its potential for mitigating HE by reducing local hydrogen concentration and hindering crack initiation and propagation.  

Stress gradients and stress concentrations are particularly important as they drive hydrogen diffusion and accumulation. Hydrogen tends to diffuse from areas of low stress to areas of high stress [4]. The hydrogen diffusion flux under stress is influenced by both the concentration gradient (denoted by $\mathsf { J } _ { \mathsf { ( C ) } }$ ) and the stress gradient (denoted by $\mathsf { J } _ { \iota } \sigma _ { \iota } \bar { \mathsf { \Pi } }$ ), and can be described by the sum of these fluxes:​  

#  

where C is the initial concentration [4]. Hydrogen accumulates at regions of stress concentration, such as notches, defects, grain boundaries, and crack tips [13,15,29,35]. Heterogeneous micromechanical stress fields specifically result in the accumulation of lattice and dislocation-trapped hydrogen at grain boundaries [15]. When the local hydrogen concentration in these high-stress regions reaches a critical value, fracture failure occurs [29]. The phenomenon of Stress-Oriented Hydrogen-Induced Cracking (SOHIC) exemplifies this combined effect, being influenced by both hydrogen diffusion and stress concentration [24]. The relationship between average stress $( \sigma _ { - } \mathsf { H } )$ and diffusible hydrogen concentration under no stress $\scriptstyle \left( { \mathsf { C } } _ { \circ } \right)$ is given by:​  

$$
\sigma _ { H } = { \frac { C _ { 0 } V _ { H } } { 3 R T } }
$$  

where $\mathsf { V } _ { - } \mathsf { H }$ is the partial molar volume of hydrogen and RT represents the product of the gas constant and temperature [4] This equation highlights the direct link between stress and hydrogen concentration at equilibrium.  

The influence of loading conditions such as strain rate on HE susceptibility is also a relevant consideration [2]. However, detailed specific insights into the effects of varying strain rates on hydrogen trapping and embrittlement mechanisms are not extensively covered in the provided digests.  

In summary, the stress state—particularly the presence of tensile stress and the existence of stress gradients and concentrations—profoundly impacts hydrogen distribution and accumulation, thereby governing the susceptibility of metallic materials to embrittlement [22,31,35]. Controlling stress levels, both applied and residual, is a critical strategy for mitigating hydrogen embrittlement [16].​

The manifestation of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) and hydrogen trapping phenomena varies significantly across different metallic systems, fundamentally influenced by their unique crystal structures, chemical compositions, and microstructural features [10,21,33]. A comparative analysis highlights how these material-specific characteristics dictate hydrogen diffusion, solubility, trapping behavior, and ultimately, susceptibility to hydrogen-induced degradation.  

Crystal structure plays a pivotal role in determining intrinsic hydrogen transport kinetics. For instance, body-centered cubic (BCC) steels generally exhibit higher hydrogen diffusion coefficients compared to face-centered cubic (FCC) stainless steels, although FCC structures can accommodate higher hydrogen solubility [7]. This difference contributes to the observed higher susceptibility of some ferritic (BCC) steels compared to stable austenitic (FCC) steels under certain hydrogen charging conditions [7]. However, even FCC nickel-based alloys, despite lower bulk diffusivity, are susceptible to HE, emphasizing the importance of factors beyond the intrinsic lattice diffusion [16,33].​  

Across all material classes, alloying elements and microstructural features serve as crucial factors influencing hydrogen behavior. Alloying additions impact hydrogen solubility and diffusivity, and more importantly, they dictate the formation, morphology, and distribution of microstructural features that act as hydrogen trapping sites [33]. These traps, ranging from lattice defects like vacancies and dislocations to interfaces (grain boundaries, phase boundaries) and precipitates (carbides, hydrides, intermetallics, dispersoids, inclusions), can concentrate hydrogen, leading to localized embrittlement [19]. The nature and binding energy of these traps are critical in determining their influence on HE susceptibility; strong, irreversible traps can sometimes be beneficial by immobilizing hydrogen, while reversible traps can exacerbate embrittlement by concentrating hydrogen at fracture-critical locations under stress.​  

Specific material classes exhibit distinct HE characteristics. Steels, encompassing low-alloy, high-strength, stainless, and pipeline varieties, show susceptibility that is highly dependent on composition, microstructure, and strength level [2,21,24,33]. Higher strength steels, in particular, face significant challenges due to increased susceptibility to cracking even at low hydrogen concentrations [2,16,26,27]. Aluminum alloys, especially high-strength series like 7xxx, are also prone to HE, with trapping primarily occurring at precipitates and grain boundaries [5]. Titanium alloys are notably susceptible due to their propensity to form brittle titanium hydrides [16,32]. The formation and characteristics of these hydrides, influenced by hydrogen concentration, composition, and microstructure, constitute the dominant HE mechanism in these materials [32]. Nickel-based alloys, while FCC, are affected by hydrogen, with grain boundary segregation of impurities and the presence of precipitates and dislocations playing key roles in trapping and promoting intergranular fracture [33].​  

Emerging materials like high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are being explored for their potential improved resistance to HE, attributed to their unique compositional and structural characteristics, such as sluggish diffusion and lattice distortion effects [3]. Research focuses on how specific elements (e.g., Cr) and precipitation behavior influence hydrogen diffusivity, trapping, and overall HE resistance in these complex multi-principal element systems [3].​  

Understanding the intricate interplay between hydrogen and material-specific factors – from crystal structure and alloying chemistry to microstructural features and their trapping capabilities – is paramount for predicting and mitigating HE. Ongoing research aims to elucidate these mechanisms and develop tailored material designs with enhanced hydrogen resistance, particularly for high-performance and emerging alloy systems [3,5,26].  

# 6.1 Steels  

The susceptibility of steels to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) varies significantly depending on their composition, crystal structure, microstructure, and strength level. This variability necessitates a detailed understanding of hydrogen behavior within different steel types to predict and mitigate HE.  

The crystal structure plays a fundamental role in hydrogen diffusion and solubility. A comparative study on Cr15 ferritic stainless steel (BCC structure) and 304 austenitic stainless steel (FCC structure) revealed that the BCC structure of ferritic steel is inherently more susceptible to HE than the FCC structure of austenitic steel [7]. This difference is attributed to significantly lower hydrogen diffusion coefficients and higher hydrogen solubility in austenitic steels compared to ferritic steels [7,29]. An increase in the content of stable austenite phases can reduce the overall HE susceptibility of steels [29]. However, certain environments, such as wet $H _ { 2 } S$ , can render carbon and low-alloy steels highly susceptible to hydrogeninduced cracking (HIC), sulfide stress cracking (SSC), and stress-oriented hydrogen-induced cracking (SOHIC) [23,24,33]. Different steel types, including austenitic, ferritic, and martensitic steels, exhibit varying degrees of HE susceptibility, ranging from negligible to extreme, depending on factors like composition and exposure conditions [28]. Martensitic steels, in particular, are often highlighted in studies investigating hydrogen trapping at nano-precipitates [17,19].  

The presence and distribution of alloying elements significantly influence hydrogen behavior and HE resistance by affecting trap site formation and overall microstructure. Elements such as carbon, chromium, nickel, manganese, molybdenum, vanadium, titanium, and niobium are known to impact HE susceptibility [33]. For instance, steels with higher carbon content generally show a greater tendency for HIC compared to low-carbon steels [31,35,36]. High-strength steels containing chromium and nickel are also noted as being particularly susceptible to hydrogen damage [31,35,36]. Research on highstrength steels has investigated the role of vanadium carbide (VC) precipitates and the carbon vacancies within them as crucial factors influencing hydrogen trapping and diffusion [18,20]. Controlling the concentration and distribution of these carbon vacancies can potentially enhance HE resistance [18,20]. Furthermore, a novel approach involves designing chemical heterogeneity, such as creating dispersed Mn-rich regions within a medium-manganese steel matrix, which can act as barriers to hydrogen-induced crack propagation and improve HE resistance [1,12].  

Microstructural features act as significant hydrogen trapping sites and crack initiation points. These features include grain size, phase interfaces, grain boundary character, precipitates, inclusions, and the specific microstructures formed by processes like welding [33]. For instance, studies on pure iron have examined the influence of grain size on HE mechanisms [25]. Precipitates, especially nano-precipitates, and their interfaces with the surrounding matrix are critical in determining hydrogen trapping behavior. Research indicates that not all nano-precipitates are beneficial for HE resistance, and interface characteristics like carbon/sulfur vacancies and local tensile strain fields play a crucial role [17,19]. Inclusions, such as those found in 20 carbon steel weldments, significantly impact susceptibility to HE by influencing hydrogen diffusion and accumulation [6]. Welding processes introduce complex microstructures, heat effects, and residual stress concentrations that critically affect HE susceptibility. For example, in X52 steel welds, the heat-affected zone (HAZ) is particularly susceptible to HIC due to microconstituents like M/A components, banded ferrite/pearlite, upper bainite, and coarse Widmanstätten structures, combined with residual stress [4]. Similarly, studies on laser-welded QP980 steel have explored the role of martensite, ferrite, and retained austenite in the weld microstructure on HE susceptibility [13]. Strain-induced features like twins and martensite can also influence HE, as observed in selective laser melted (SLM) 316L stainless steel [21]. Regions with increased constraint levels (CL) within the microstructure are expected to be potential damage initiation zones [15].​  

A significant challenge in steel development is the increasing susceptibility to HE with increasing strength levels [4,15,16,26]. High-strength and low-alloy steels are widely recognized as highly susceptible to HE [2,8,16]. As strength and hardness increase, even small amounts of hydrogen can lead to cracking [8]. Steels treated to strengths up to 485 MPa may develop longitudinal cracks, while higher strength levels exceeding 830 MPa can result in transverse cracks, particularly in weld metal [8]. Steels harder than approximately 35-40 Rockwell C (RC) require specific handling and testing procedures when exposed to electrolytes [8]. The increased susceptibility of higher strength steels necessitates the development of specific design strategies to mitigate HE [26], such as developing robust ferritic steels with tensile strength above 950 MPa for highpressure hydrogen service [5]. Pipeline steels, in particular, face significant HE challenges with increasing strength, necessitating research into phenomena like hydrogen attack in high-pressure hydrogenation equipment leading to methane generation on grain boundaries, or white spots in heavy rail and large forgings caused by high-pressure hydrogen molecules and stress [2,11].​  

In summary, the HE susceptibility of steels is a complex interplay of crystal structure, phase composition, alloying elements, and microstructural features, with higher strength levels generally exacerbating the issue. Understanding the role of hydrogen trapping at various sites, from crystal lattice defects to complex microstructural features and phase interfaces, is crucial for designing HE-resistant steels [33].  

# 6.2 Aluminum Alloys  

Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is a significant concern for various aluminum alloy series, particularly high-strength compositions used in structural applications [5]. The susceptibility to HE varies among different alloy types, influenced by factors such as microstructure, alloying elements, and processing routes. Research into the HE behavior of aluminum alloys involves identifying dominant mechanisms and understanding the role of microstructural features as hydrogen trapping sites.​  

A specific focus has been placed on high-strength aluminum alloys, such as those in the 7xxx series. Studies investigating these alloys have provided detailed insights into their susceptibility and the mechanisms underlying HE [14]. Key findings indicate that specific precipitates and grain boundaries act as critical locations for hydrogen accumulation, thereby contributing to embrittlement [14]. For instance, in a study on a 7xxx series alloy, $A l _ { 3 } Z _ { r }$ dispersoids, S phase precipitates, and grain boundaries were identified as primary hydrogen trapping sites [14]. The presence and distribution of these microstructural features, which are inherently linked to the alloy's composition and thermomechanical processing, significantly influence the capacity for hydrogen trapping and, consequently, the alloy's resistance to embrittlement.  

The influence of alloying elements and processing routes on HE resistance is primarily mediated through their effect on the formation, size, morphology, and distribution of these trapping sites. For example, the type and amount of alloying additions determine the phases that precipitate, while processing routes control precipitation kinetics and grain structure.  

Understanding these complex relationships is crucial for designing aluminum alloys with improved HE performance. Research also extends to specialized materials like carbon fiber reinforced aluminum alloys, which present unique challenges and considerations regarding hydrogen interactions [34]. Furthermore, environmental factors, such as the presence of water vapor, are being investigated for their influence on hydrogen uptake and embrittlement, particularly in high-strength aluminum alloys intended for use in hydrogen-containing environments [5]. Validation of physical models for moisture/hydrogen-surface interactions is essential for predicting and mitigating HE in these critical applications [5].  

# 6.3 Titanium Alloys  

Titanium alloys are recognized as materials particularly susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) [16]. The primary mechanism driving HE in these alloys is the formation and characteristics of brittle titanium hydrides [32,38]. Metals from Group IVB, such as titanium, along with Group VB elements, readily form hydrides, which are intrinsically brittle and contribute significantly to material degradation [11].​  

The formation of titanium hydrides is critically dependent on the local hydrogen concentration within the material [32,38]. Studies indicate that acicular hydride phases become observable under metallographic examination when the hydrogen content in titanium reaches a concentration range of $0 . 0 0 8 \%$ to $0 . 0 1 5 \%$ by weight [32]. As the overall hydrogen content increases beyond this critical threshold, both the number density and the average volume of these precipitated hydride phases tend to increase [32]. The morphology, distribution, and volume fraction of these brittle hydride precipitates are crucial factors influencing the HE behavior of titanium alloys. Hydride formation often occurs preferentially at stress concentrations or specific microstructural features, and their presence disrupts the continuity of the metallic matrix, acting as crack initiation sites and paths for brittle fracture.​  

The susceptibility of titanium alloys to hydride formation and subsequent HE is significantly influenced by their composition and microstructure [32,38]. Alloying elements, notably aluminum (Al) and vanadium (V), play a substantial role in affecting hydride formation kinetics and, consequently, the overall resistance to HE [32,38]. Research on specific alloys, such as Ti-6Al4V, highlights the importance of understanding hydrogen behavior in these complex systems. Furthermore, the existing microstructure of the titanium alloy dictates potential hydrogen trapping sites, diffusion pathways, and preferred locations for hydride precipitation, all of which modulate the material's response to hydrogen ingress and its propensity for embrittlement [32,38]. Therefore, tailoring alloy composition and controlling processing routes to optimize microstructure are essential strategies for mitigating hydrogen embrittlement in titanium alloys.  

# 6.4 Nickel-Based Alloys  

Nickel-based alloys, characterized by their face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, are widely utilized in critical applications due to their excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. Compared to many body-centered cubic (BCC) steels, the intrinsic hydrogen diffusivity in the FCC lattice of nickel is generally lower, which might suggest a potentially higher resistance to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) under certain conditions [33]. However, despite this lower bulk diffusivity, nickel-based alloys are not immune to hydrogen embrittlement and can exhibit significant susceptibility [16].  

Factors significantly influencing the hydrogen susceptibility of nickel-based alloys include the segregation of detrimental elements to grain boundaries and the presence of specific microstructures [33]. Grain boundaries themselves act as potential hydrogen traps, but their trapping strength and impact on HE are significantly amplified by the presence of segregated impurities. Theoretical studies, such as that by Zhang et al. [34], have investigated the effect of element segregation on the dissolution and diffusion of hydrogen at interfaces, specifically examining the $N i / N i _ { 3 } A l$ interface, highlighting the importance of such interfaces as hydrogen accumulation sites. The composition of the alloy, including the presence of specific alloying elements, also plays a crucial role by affecting hydrogen solubility and transport properties. For instance, Ito et al. [34] studied the effects of elements like Cr, Mn, and Fe on the hydrogen solubility in nickel under highpressure hydrogen environments, demonstrating how compositional variations can alter hydrogen uptake characteristics.  

Research on specific nickel-based alloys like GH3536 and alloy 718 [21,34] provides specific insights into their unique HE behavior under various conditions. These studies reveal that hydrogen trapping at microstructural features such as precipitates, dislocations, and grain boundaries with varying degrees of segregation can lead to localized hydrogen accumulation, ultimately facilitating fracture.​  

The dominant HE mechanisms observed in nickel-based alloys under relevant conditions are actively investigated [33]. While the specific mechanism can vary depending on the alloy composition, microstructure, hydrogen concentration, and applied stress state, mechanisms involving hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) and hydrogen-induced decohesion (HID) are frequently discussed. The strong trapping character of segregated grain boundaries often promotes intergranular fracture, suggesting a significant role for mechanisms that reduce cohesion at these interfaces or enhance localized deformation along them. The interaction of hydrogen with dislocations and its impact on dislocation mobility also contribute to the embrittlement process in these FCC materials.  

# 6.5 High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs)  

Emerging research is increasingly focusing on the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), a class of materials characterized by their multi‐principal element composition [3]. These alloys possess unique properties, including the high entropy effect, sluggish diffusion kinetics, and severe lattice distortion, which are hypothesized to contribute to improved resistance against hydrogen embrittlement compared to traditional alloys [3,33]. The vast compositional space available in multi‐principal element systems offers significant potential for tailoring materials to enhance hydrogen embrittlement resistance by manipulating how hydrogen interacts with the material structure [3].  

The influence of composition on hydrogen behavior and HE susceptibility in HEAs is a key area of investigation. Different constituent elements can significantly impact hydrogen embrittlement resistance by affecting various processes: altering hydrogen solid solution and diffusion rates, influencing structural evolution through changes in stacking fault energy, modifying free electron concentration and electronic structure, and promoting the formation of specific precipitated phases [3].​  

Chromium (Cr) is frequently included in HEA compositions, and its role in hydrogen behavior has been studied extensively [3]. Research indicates that increasing Cr content can lead to a significant decrease in the hydrogen diffusion coefficient in alloys like Fe20Mn20Ni20Co20Cr20 and Fe22Mn40Ni30Co6Cr2 [3,34]. This suggests that Cr content directly affects hydrogen diffusivity [3]. Furthermore, adding an appropriate amount of Cr (specifically, a mass fraction below $2 0 \%$ ) has been found to improve resistance to environmental hydrogen embrittlement and enhance mechanical properties in hydrogen‐containing environments [3]. The multifaceted impact of Cr also extends to microstructure; Cr carbides can function as hydrogen trapping sites, influencing hydrogen distribution within the material [3]. Additionally, Cr is known to affect the critical temperature for martensitic transformation, a microstructural change that can influence hydrogen‐induced cracking susceptibility [3]. These findings highlight that Cr's effect on HE resistance is complex, involving microstructural and electronic structure modifications, and is optimized within a specific concentration range [3].​  

Microstructure plays a critical role in the HE behavior of HEAs, often intertwined with compositional effects. Precipitated phases, such as the Cr carbides mentioned, can act as hydrogen trapping sites, potentially influencing the effective diffusivity and localization of hydrogen [3]. The role of precipitation in affecting hydrogen diffusivity and mechanical properties in HEAs has been a specific focus of research [34]. Furthermore, the presence of different phases within an HEA, such as in dual-phase eutectic compositions like Co30Cr10Fe10Al18Ni30Mo2, impacts their hydrogen‐induced cracking behavior [34]. Understanding how composition and processing history dictate the resulting microstructure and, consequently, hydrogen trapping and transport is crucial for designing HEAs with improved HE resistance. The observed effects of specific elements like Cr on factors such as martensitic transformation temperature further underscore the interplay between composition and microstructure in determining hydrogen behavior [3].  

# 7. Mitigation Strategies for Hydrogen Embrittlement  

![](images/e3724f7e2a4945a71b15d28a40afa4c3d9c7ac0edf19fcf7333383caeeebbfb4.jpg)  

Mitigating hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in metallic materials is critical for ensuring the safety and longevity of infrastructure and components operating in hydrogen‐containing environments [5,10]. A range of strategies has been developed, broadly categorized by their approach to managing hydrogen within the material or its environment. These strategies often target  

preventing hydrogen entry, reducing hydrogen concentration, modifying material susceptibility to hydrogen, or removing absorbed hydrogen [28,29]. Effective mitigation typically involves a combination of these approaches, tailored to the specific material, application, and service conditions [5,10].  

One fundamental approach involves enhancing the material's intrinsic resistance through careful material selection, alloy design, and microstructure control [4,10,27,29]. This involves selecting materials known for lower HE susceptibility, such as certain austenitic stainless steels over ferritic counterparts, and designing alloy compositions with beneficial elements like V, Ti, Nb, Al, C, N, Ni, Mn, Cr, and Mo that influence hydrogen solubility, diffusion, and trapping characteristics [4,11,27,33,34]. Microstructure control focuses on refining grains, optimizing phase distribution, and engineering precipitates and their interfaces to create benign hydrogen traps [1,4,12,17,19,27]. Strategies like introducing chemical heterogeneity or tailoring precipitate interfaces with features like carbon vacancies can significantly enhance hydrogen trapping ability and improve HE resistance [1,12,17,18,19,20]. These approaches aim to reduce the concentration of mobile hydrogen at critical sites or create barriers to its movement, though achieving optimal HE resistance often requires navigating trade-offs with other desired mechanical properties [14].​  

Preventing or limiting hydrogen entry from the service environment is another crucial strategy, achieved through surface treatments and environmental control [4,27,29,35]. Surface treatments, such as shot peening or surface alloying, introduce beneficial residual compressive stresses or modify the surface microstructure to hinder crack initiation [4,22,33]. Applying hydrogen permeation barriers (HPBs) in the form of coatings is a primary method to suppress hydrogen ingress [4,26,27,29]. The effectiveness of these coatings is quantified by the Permeation Reduction Factor (PRF), calculated as the ratio of hydrogen permeation rate through the uncoated substrate (j₍uncoated₎) to that through the coated substrate (j₍coated₎):  

$$
P R F = { \frac { j _ { u n c o a t e d } } { j _ { c o a t e d } } }
$$  

For a simple barrier–substrate system, the PRF is approximately related to the permeabilities (P) and thicknesses (d) of the substrate (s) and barrier (b) as:  

$$
P R F \cong { \frac { d _ { b } P _ { s } } { d _ { s } P _ { b } } }
$$  

[30]. Various coating types, including ceramics $( A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } , C r _ { 2 } O _ { 3 } )$ , nitrides (TiN, CrN), carbon materials (graphene), and certain metallic or composite coatings, are employed, each with varying PRF values and applicability [26,30]. However, some metallic coatings (e.g., zinc) can introduce hydrogen during application, necessitating subsequent removal treatments [31,35,36]. Environmental control involves avoiding direct exposure to hydrogen sources and managing environmental parameters like humidity and temperature [16,22,33,35]. The use of chemical inhibitors, such as oxygen or carbon monoxide, to suppress hydrogen adsorption on the metal surface is also an effective strategy [2,34]. Caution is required with cathodic protection, which, while preventing corrosion, can generate hydrogen and increase HE risk [33].​  

When hydrogen has entered the material during manufacturing or service, removal techniques are applied to mitigate its detrimental effects [8,16,31,35,36]. The most common method is baking or dehydrogenation heat treatment, which promotes hydrogen diffusion out of the material [31,35,36]. The effectiveness of baking is dependent on temperature and duration, with higher temperatures and longer times facilitating more thorough removal [31,35,36]. Baking is particularly important after processes known to introduce hydrogen, such as electroplating, and should be performed promptly [8,36]. Other methods like vacuum degassing and electrochemical extraction also exist [33]. Despite these techniques, challenges remain in removing hydrogen from deep trapping sites, which require higher energy or longer times [34].​  

Combining these distinct strategies is often necessary to achieve optimal HE resistance for specific materials and applications [5,10]. For example, a high-strength steel designed with beneficial microstructural traps might also be protected by a hydrogen barrier coating and utilized in an environment where hydrogen generation is minimized or inhibited. Post-processing hydrogen removal could then address any hydrogen uptake during manufacturing or coating application. However, developing cost-effective and scalable HE mitigation techniques remains a significant challenge [5,10]. Future research needs to focus on integrating these approaches, understanding the synergistic effects of combined strategies, optimizing methods for specific applications, and addressing long-term performance, cost, and environmental considerations.​  

# 7.1 Material Selection and Alloy Design  

Selecting and designing metallic materials with high resistance to hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is critical for ensuring structural integrity in hydrogen-rich environments. Guidelines for material selection are often based on understanding how material composition, microstructure, and resulting mechanical properties influence hydrogen uptake, transport, and interaction with the material [10]. Different material classes exhibit varying degrees of HE susceptibility; for instance, austenitic stainless steels are generally considered to have higher resistance to hydrogen embrittlement compared to ferritic stainless steels [7]. For applications prone to hydrogen attack, using low-carbon steel that has undergone full spheroidization is recommended, along with controlled deoxidation processes and the addition of specific elements to fix carbon [11].​  

Tailoring alloy composition and microstructure is a primary strategy to enhance HE resistance [10,27]. Alloying elements play a crucial role by influencing surface structures and kinetics related to hydrogen adsorption and transport [26]. Designing hydrogen-resistant surfaces involves controlling the accumulation of specific alloying elements at the surface to reduce hydrogen adsorption energy, inhibit dissociation of $H _ { 2 }$ ​ molecules, facilitate recombination of hydrogen atoms, and increase the energy barrier for hydrogen diffusion into the bulk [27].​  

Promoting beneficial hydrogen trapping is a key mechanism leveraged in alloy design [10,27,33]. This involves introducing microstructural features that can reversibly bind hydrogen, thus reducing the concentration of detrimental diffusible hydrogen at crack tips or other stress concentrations. A prominent approach is the design of alloys that promote the formation of nano-precipitates with favorable interface characteristics for hydrogen trapping [17,19]. Research highlights the importance of optimizing precipitation strengthening strategies by considering the atomic-scale interactions between hydrogen and these precipitate interfaces [17]. Specifically, manipulating the concentration and distribution of carbon vacancies in carbides, such as vanadium carbide (VC) precipitates, can significantly enhance their hydrogen trapping ability and improve the HE resistance of high-strength steels [18,20].  

Beyond conventional homogeneous compositions, utilizing chemical heterogeneity has emerged as a novel strategy to improve HE resistance [1,12]. For instance, introducing Mn-rich regions in steel can enhance its resistance to hydrogen embrittlement [12]. Microstructural control also extends to managing phase morphology and the distribution of second phases. For example, in high-strength aluminum alloys, increasing the volume fraction of the second phase and controlling its dispersion and chemical composition can enhance HE resistance [14]. Strategies like eliminating detrimental features such as Mg decoration of grain boundaries by trapping grain boundaries into precipitates can also be employed [14].​  

Specific alloying elements are widely employed to tailor HE resistance. Elements such as V, Ti, and rare earths are added to steels to fix carbon and mitigate issues like hydrogen attack ( $C H _ { 4 }$ ​ bubble formation) and white spots, partly by trapping hydrogen or stabilizing carbides [11]. Nb addition has also been shown to improve the HE resistance of steels used in hydrogen storage applications [34]. Other common alloying elements like Cr, Ni, Mo, V, Ti, Nb, and Mn are used to influence hydrogen solubility, diffusion kinetics, trapping characteristics, and the overall microstructure [33]. Conversely, certain elements or practices can be detrimental; for example, avoiding Al deoxidation in steels intended for hydrogen service is recommended because the resulting $A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 }$ ​ can act as nucleation sites for methane bubbles during hydrogen attack [11]. Designing alloys for improved corrosion resistance, such as certain Cr-Si-Mo compositions, can indirectly contribute to HE mitigation by limiting hydrogen entry [21].  

Crucially, the design process involves navigating trade-offs between enhancing HE resistance and maintaining or improving other performance requirements, such as strength, ductility, and corrosion resistance [14]. While strategies like increasing the volume fraction of beneficial phases can improve hydrogen resistance, they may sometimes adversely affect mechanical properties [14]. Successful alloy design thus requires a delicate balance to achieve the desired combination of HE resistance and overall structural performance.  

# 7.2 Microstructure Control  

Controlling the microstructure is a critical strategy for mitigating hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility in metallic materials [4,27]. This approach focuses on manipulating features such as grain structure, phase distribution, and the presence of precipitates to influence hydrogen diffusion pathways and to engineer hydrogen trap characteristics—including their density, distribution, and binding energy.​  

Grain refinement is one method employed to enhance HE resistance. Smaller grains reduce the concentration of hydrogen per unit area that accumulates at grain boundaries, which are often preferred diffusion paths and potential fracture initiation sites. Additionally, a finer grain structure minimizes strain localization, further improving hydrogen resistance [27].  

Beyond size, the character of grain boundaries can be tailored to be more resistant to hydrogen-assisted cracking [27]. In certain aluminum alloys, for example, reducing the size of precipitate-free zones (PFZs) adjacent to grain boundaries can mitigate the hydrogen-enhanced contrast in mechanical properties between the hydrogen-modified grain boundaries and the less affected bulk material [14].  

Precipitate engineering is another potent technique. Precipitated phases—particularly nanosized ones—can act as effective hydrogen traps [4,27]. These nanosized precipitates are reported to be less prone to hydrogen-induced cracking than other microstructural features, making them potentially excellent benign hydrogen traps [27]. Research emphasizes the importance of controlling the characteristics of these nano-precipitates and their interfaces to manage hydrogen trapping effectively [17]. Specifically, interfaces with features such as carbon/sulfur vacancies and tensile strain fields can enhance hydrogen trapping at benign sites [19]. These interfaces, together with precipitates, nano-precipitates, and high dislocation density cell walls formed during heat treatment and processing, can introduce effective deep hydrogen traps, thereby conferring excellent HE resistance [4]. However, it is important to note that the stability of nano-precipitates may be compromised under significant changes in external conditions such as temperature and pressure, which could deteriorate the material's HE resistance [4]. The precipitation behavior of nanoparticles and their influence on HE susceptibility can be tuned through parameters like tempering temperature [34].  

Optimizing phase distribution and introducing designed chemical heterogeneity are also beneficial. For instance, the introduction of Mn-rich regions into the microstructure can effectively impede the propagation of hydrogen-induced cracks and enhance the overall HE resistance of high-strength steels [1,12]. These regions act by altering local hydrogen concentration and diffusion.  

The overarching goal of these microstructural control strategies is to manage the interaction between hydrogen and the material by manipulating trap sites. By increasing the density of benign or deep traps while potentially reducing detrimental ones, hydrogen can be sequestered away from critical areas where stress concentration and hydrogen accumulation would otherwise lead to fracture. These benign traps reduce the mobile hydrogen concentration available to diffuse to sensitive areas such as crack tips or susceptible grain boundaries. The effectiveness of trapping is related to the trap binding energy; deeper traps hold hydrogen more strongly, thereby reducing its contribution to embrittlement. Consequently, microstructure control provides a pathway to enhance HE resistance by engineering the landscape of hydrogen diffusion and trapping within the material [4,27].  

Proper heat treatment processes [32], including controlled preheat schedules and interpass temperatures for materials lik high-strength low-alloy steels [8], are also integral to achieving the desired microstructural state for optimal HE resistance.  

Note: No mathematical formulas or expressions involving non-KaTeX macros were found, so no modifications for KaTeX compatibility were necessary.  

# 7.3 Surface Treatments and Coatings  

Surface treatments and applied coatings represent crucial strategies for mitigating hydrogen embrittlement (HE) in metals by influencing hydrogen entry, diffusion, and trapping behavior [4,27,29]. These methods primarily operate through two mechanisms: introducing compressive residual stresses near the surface to hinder crack initiation and propagation, and creating physical barriers to prevent or reduce hydrogen ingress into the bulk material [4,22].  

Mechanical surface treatments, such as shot peening, are effective in introducing compressive residual stresses at the surface [4,22]. This compressive stress field counteracts the tensile stresses required for crack propagation, thereby increasing the material's resistance to hydrogen-assisted cracking [22]. Similarly, processes like cold working, surface alloying, nitriding, and carburizing can modify surface properties—including the stress state and microstructure—to enhance HE resistance [33]. Before applying surface treatments like plating, mechanical cleaning is often preferred, sometimes followed by stress relieving to address stresses induced during machining or grinding [8]. For components subjected to fatigue loading, shot peening is recommended after baking but before hard chrome plating [8].  

The application of coatings serves as a primary method to establish hydrogen permeation barriers (HPBs) on or beneath the metal surface, effectively suppressing hydrogen entry and enhancing HE resistance [4,27,29]. The effectiveness of HPBs is quantitatively assessed using the Permeation Reduction Factor (PRF), defined as the ratio of the permeation rate of the uncoated substrate (​juncoated​ ) to that of the coated substrate (​jcoated​ ):​  

$$
P R F = { \frac { j _ { u n c o a t e d } } { j _ { c o a t e d } } }
$$  

For a system comprising a barrier of thickness $d _ { b }$ ​ on a substrate of thickness $d _ { s }$ , the PRF can be approximated by the ratio of the permeabilities of the substrate $( P _ { s } )$ and the barrier $( P _ { b } )$ scaled by their thicknesses:  

$$
P R F \cong { \frac { d _ { b } P _ { s } } { d _ { s } P _ { b } } }
$$  

[30].

Various types of coatings have been investigated for their efficacy as hydrogen barriers. Ceramic coatings, such as $A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 }$ ​ , $C r _ { 2 } O _ { 3 }$ ​ , $Y _ { 2 } O _ { 3 }$ ​ , $S i O _ { 2 }$ ​ , $E r _ { 2 } O _ { 3 }$ ​ , and $Z r O _ { 2 }$ ​ , have demonstrated the ability to enhance HE resistance [26]. Specific ceramic coatings show notable PRF values, including $A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 }$ ​ $( \mathsf { P R F } = 1 0 0 0 )$ , $C r _ { 2 } O _ { 3 }$ ​ $\left( \mathsf { P R F } = 1 0 0 0 \right)$ ), and TiAlN $( \mathsf { P R F } = 6 8 0 0$ ) [30]. Nitride coatings—including TiN, SiN, CrN, and AlN—form protective nitride layers that significantly improve resistance to HE [26]. TiN, for instance, exhibits a PRF of 100 [30]. Carbon material coatings, such as MXene and graphene, function as physical barriers to impede hydrogen permeation [26]. Metallic and alloy coatings, including Zn, Al-Si, Cd, Sn, Ni, and Cr, can also provide protective functions [26]. However, some metallic coatings—notably zinc plating applied to parts like aircraft components and high-strength steel elastic parts—can introduce hydrogen during the plating process, necessitating a subsequent hydrogen removal treatment [31,35]. Advanced metallic coatings, such as electroplated Ni coating incorporating manipulated nano-WS₂ aggregates, are being explored as surface treatment methods to mitigate HE in specific materials like X70 pipeline steel [37]. Composite coatings, such as tannic-acid-modified graphene oxide composites, have shown promise with favorable corrosion inhibition, self-healing, and photothermal conversion properties, which can indirectly contribute to mitigating hydrogen-related degradation [37]. Multilayer structured coatings, including Al-based multilayers and Cr/CrₓN coatings, are designed to offer superior resistance to hydrogen permeation compared to single layers [26].  

Comparing different coating types, ceramic and specific nitride coatings appear to offer high PRF values, indicating strong potential as hydrogen diffusion barriers [30]. Carbon-based materials function primarily as physical barriers [26]. While metallic coatings are widely used, their interaction with hydrogen—particularly hydrogen uptake during application processes like electroplating (e.g., with Zn)—presents a significant challenge that requires post-treatment [31,35]. Factors influencing the effectiveness of these HPBs include not only the material's inherent hydrogen permeability but also coating thickness and quality aspects such as density and adhesion, although specific data on the impact of density and adhesion were not detailed in the reviewed digests [30].  

Information regarding the long-term durability and environmental impact of these diverse surface treatments and coatings was not provided within the scope of the reviewed digests.  

7.4 Hydrogen Removal Techniques (Baking/Dehydrogenation)  

Following hydrogen absorption during manufacturing processes or exposure, various techniques are employed to mitigate hydrogen embrittlement by removing the interstitial hydrogen. The most commonly discussed approach in the provided literature is heat treatment, specifically baking or dehydrogenation annealing [8,16,31,35,36]. This method relies on increasing the thermal energy of the system to enhance the diffusion rate of hydrogen atoms through the metal lattice, allowing them to escape from the material's surface.  

Different methods of applying heat are utilized. One prevalent technique involves placing components in a vacuum oven, typically at temperatures ranging from $2 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ to $2 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ , for a duration of 2 to 3 hours [31,35,36]. Alternatively, immersing components in hot oil can achieve similar results [35,36]. The hot oil method is noted for potentially offering simpler equipment requirements and more uniform heating compared to oven treatment [35,36].  

The effectiveness of hydrogen removal through baking is fundamentally dependent on both the temperature and the duration of the treatment [31,35,36]. Generally, higher temperatures and longer durations facilitate more thorough hydrogen removal by increasing diffusivity and providing sufficient time for hydrogen to egress from the bulk material [36]. Experimental evidence, such as annealing pure iron samples, indicates that heating to $2 5 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ can effectively remove the majority of hydrogen introduced during processing steps like wet polishing [25].  

The timing of baking is also crucial, particularly in processes like electroplating. Hydrogen is absorbed during pre-plating steps such as pickling and cathodic cleaning, and it is essential to remove this hydrogen through suitable baking before the plating process [8]. Furthermore, if hydrogen is absorbed during the plating process itself, a new baking cycle should commence as soon as feasible after plating, maintaining definite temperatures for sufficient time to ensure hydrogen diffusion out of the steel [8].​  

Beyond baking, other methods mentioned for hydrogen removal include vacuum degassing and electrochemical extraction [33]. These techniques, along with baking, have associated kinetics, efficiency factors, and limitations that influence their applicability [33]. The effectiveness of removal techniques can vary depending on the specific material properties, the concentration and distribution of hydrogen, and the geometry of the component. While baking is widely applicable, its efficiency is governed by the hydrogen diffusion coefficient in the material, which is temperature-dependent.  

A related but distinct approach involves using pulsed electric current to repair embrittlement induced by certain hydride configurations by dissolving partial hydrides [34]. This technique appears focused on mitigating the effects of hydrogen precipitates rather than solely removing interstitial hydrogen.  

Despite the availability of these techniques, challenges persist in achieving complete hydrogen removal, particularly from deep trapping sites within the material microstructure. Hydrogen atoms can be trapped at various defects such as dislocations, grain boundaries, and interfaces, as well as potentially forming hydrides [34]. Removing hydrogen from these stable trapping sites often requires higher thermal energy or longer diffusion times compared to removing freely diffusing hydrogen. The provided literature does not specifically detail the potential for re-embrittlement after successful dehydrogenation treatments.​  

# 7.5 Environmental Control  

Controlling the service environment constitutes a primary strategy to mitigate hydrogen embrittlement (HE) by limiting hydrogen generation and subsequent entry into metallic structures [10,35]. A fundamental approach involves avoiding direct exposure to hydrogen sources [16]. Beyond source avoidance, managing environmental parameters such as humidity and temperature is crucial in reducing hydrogen availability or uptake [33].​  

The application of inhibitors in corrosive environments serves as a vital means to suppress hydrogen generation on the metal surface [33]. Certain chemical species present in the environment, particularly gas impurities, have been shown to influence hydrogen adsorption kinetics. For instance, the presence of gases like oxygen and carbon monoxide can inhibit hydrogen adsorption on the steel surface, thereby potentially decreasing susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement [2]. Specific research by Zhao et al. has demonstrated the role of carbon monoxide in inhibiting hydrogen embrittlement in X80 steel welds, even at various hydrogen blending ratios, highlighting this as an effective method of environmental control [34].  

Cathodic protection (CP) is another widely employed method for controlling the service environment, primarily used to prevent metallic corrosion [33]. By shifting the potential of the metal to a more negative value, CP effectively reduces the rate of anodic dissolution. However, while CP is beneficial for corrosion control, it can paradoxically increase the risk of hydrogen entry into the metal [33]. This occurs because the cathodic reaction at the metal surface is typically the reduction of water or protons, which generates atomic hydrogen. If this hydrogen is not desorbed as molecular hydrogen gas, it can be adsorbed and absorbed into the metal lattice, potentially exacerbating hydrogen embrittlement. Therefore, careful control and monitoring are necessary when using cathodic protection in environments where hydrogen embrittlement is a concern.  

8. Experimental Techniques for Characterizing Hydrogen Embrittlement and Trapping  

![](images/f16e33a46bfc6fc70bc0bb61fa478f525f475b180fdea57b8ed5961326a48cf8.jpg)  

Investigating hydrogen embrittlement (HE) and trapping in metals necessitates the application of a diverse array of experimental techniques capable of providing insights into hydrogen behavior across multiple scales, from atomic interactions to macroscopic mechanical responses [3,10,21,25,29]. These techniques are crucial for quantifying hydrogen content and distribution, characterizing trapping sites, determining diffusion kinetics, evaluating the impact of hydrogen on mechanical properties, and understanding hydrogen-induced microstructural changes [3,10,21,25,29]. Furthermore, they serve as fundamental tools for validating proposed HE mechanisms and evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation strategies [3,10,21,25,29].​  

Characterization of hydrogen itself involves techniques aimed at quantifying its presence, spatial distribution, and interaction energies with the material lattice and defects [21,29]. Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS) is widely utilized to measure total hydrogen content and analyze hydrogen release from different trapping sites upon heating [25,29]. The principle relies on relating the temperature of desorption peaks (T_P) to trap activation energy (E_a) via the Kissinger-like equation:​  

$$
{ \frac { \partial \ln \left( { \frac { \phi } { T _ { P } ^ { 2 } } } \right) } { \partial \left( { \frac { 1 } { T _ { P } } } \right) } } = - { \frac { E _ { a } } { R } }
$$  

where $\Phi$ is the heating rate and R is the gas constant [29]. This allows for quantitative characterization of trap energies and densities [5,9,29]. Electrochemical permeation tests, such as the Devanathan–Stachurski method, are crucial for determining hydrogen diffusion coefficients and permeability, providing insights into mobile hydrogen transport and trap density effects on kinetics [2,30]. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), including TOF-SIMS, offers spatial mapping of hydrogen distribution, revealing its localization at microstructural features [7,29]. Atom Probe Tomography (APT), particularly when using deuterium tracers, provides unparalleled atomic-scale resolution for mapping hydrogen distribution at specific trapping sites like grain boundaries, precipitates, and defects [14,17,19,21]. Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM) allows for probing hydrogen trapping behavior at individual nano-precipitate interfaces [17,19]. Historical methods, such as the hydrogen determinator invented by Mr. Li Xun, also contributed significantly to quantifying bulk hydrogen content [31]. While TDS and permeation provide quantitative data on content, diffusion, and trap energies, SIMS and APT excel at visualizing where hydrogen resides, offering complementary insights.​  

Microstructural characterization techniques are essential for understanding the pathways of hydrogen diffusion and accumulation, as well as the material's response to hydrogen presence [10,25]. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is routinely used to examine fracture surfaces, revealing tell-tale signs of hydrogen-induced brittle fracture like cleavage facets and crack paths associated with microstructural features [3,7,12,13]. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), including aberration-corrected STEM and in-situ ETEM, allows for high-resolution imaging of defects, precipitates, and direct observation of hydrogen-induced microstructural changes like hydride formation [5,17,19,21]. Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) provides crystallographic information, enabling correlation of hydrogen-induced cracks with grain boundaries, grain orientation, and dislocation structures [2,7,12,13,25]. Combining these imaging techniques with elemental analysis methods like EDX/EDS and EELS provides further insight into the chemical environment influencing hydrogen behavior [12,17].​  

Mechanical testing techniques are the primary means to quantitatively assess the macroscopic impact of hydrogen on material performance [3,25]. Slow Strain Rate Tensile (SSRT) testing is widely employed to measure hydrogen-induced ductility loss, a key indicator of HE susceptibility, by comparing the reduction in area or elongation of hydrogen-charged versus uncharged samples [2,7,12,13,25,28,33]. The Hydrogen Embrittlement Index (HEI or I) is commonly used to quantify sensitivity [25]. Fracture toughness tests (K_IC, J_IC) quantify crack propagation resistance, fatigue tests evaluate behavior under cyclic loading, and static load tests reveal delayed fracture phenomena [5,10,11,33]. Specialized tests like pre-load testing are designed for specific applications such as fasteners [22]. Hydrogen-Induced Cracking (HIC) tests, standardized by NACE and GB/T, are critical for evaluating steel susceptibility in $H _ { 2 } S$ environments, using metrics like Crack Length Ratio (CLR), Crack Thickness Ratio (CTR), and Crack Sensitivity Ratio (CSR) [23,24,33].​  

In summary, a comprehensive understanding of hydrogen embrittlement and trapping requires a multi-technique approach [7,17,19]. Techniques for hydrogen detection and measurement quantify hydrogen content, distribution, diffusion, and trap characteristics [7,11,14,17,19,21,25,29,30,31,34]. Microstructural characterization techniques reveal how hydrogen interacts with material features and induces structural changes [2,3,5,7,10,12,13,14,17,19,21,25,29,32]. Mechanical testing methods quantify the macroscopic consequences of hydrogen on strength, ductility, and fracture resistance [2,3,5,7,8,10,11,12,13,21,23,24,25,28,33]. Despite their power, challenges remain in accurately detecting and quantifying this light, mobile element, particularly at low concentrations and specific defect sites [21]. Integrating data from these complementary techniques is crucial for elucidating complex HE mechanisms and guiding the development of HE-resistant materials and mitigation strategies [3,10,21,25,29].​  

# 8.1 Hydrogen Detection and Measurement Techniques  

Quantitative analysis of hydrogen content, its distribution, and interaction with material microstructure is critical for understanding hydrogen embrittlement mechanisms in metals. Various techniques have been developed to detect and measure hydrogen, each offering unique capabilities and limitations.

Prominent among these are Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS), Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), and electrochemical permeation tests [7,25,29,30].  

Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS) is a widely used technique based on the principle that hydrogen is released from a material upon heating [29]. By measuring the rate of hydrogen desorption as a function of temperature, TDS provides information about the total hydrogen content in a sample, typically after hydrogen charging [25]. For example, one study employed TDS to measure hydrogen content in cathodically charged iron samples by heating them from $- 1 3 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ to $3 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ [25]. A unique strength of TDS is its ability to characterize hydrogen trapping sites by analyzing the desorption spectra [29]. Peaks in the desorption spectrum correspond to hydrogen release from different trapping sites. The temperature at which a peak occurs $( T _ { P } )$ is related to the trap activation energy ( $E _ { a }$ ) and the heating rate ${ \bigl ( } \phi { \bigr ) }$ , allowing for calculation of $E _ { a }$ ​ using the equation:

{ \frac { \partial \ln \left( { \frac { \phi } { T _ { \mathrm { P } } ^ { 2 } } } \right) } { \partial { \frac { 1 } { T _ { \mathrm { P } } } } } } = - { \frac { E _ { \mathrm { a } } } { R } }
$$  

where $R$ is the gas constant [29]. This provides quantitative data on trap energies and densities, which is crucial for understanding hydrogen interactions with specific microstructural features [5,9,29].  

Electrochemical permeation tests, notably the Devanathan–Stachurski method, are primarily used to study hydrogen transport behavior in metals [30]. This method involves electrochemically charging hydrogen into one side of a membrane and detecting the hydrogen that permeates through to the other side using a potentiostat [30]. This technique is well-suited for measuring hydrogen permeability and the effective diffusion coefficient [2,30]. Furthermore, analysis of permeation transients can yield information regarding hydrogen trap density and subsurface hydrogen concentration [2,30]. While providing insights into mobile hydrogen and transport parameters, this method is less direct for quantifying total hydrogen content or distinguishing specific trap energy levels compared to TDS. Gas-phase permeation, using methods like the differential pressure technique, offers an alternative approach for measuring similar transport parameters, particularly relevant for gaseous hydrogen environments [5,30].​  

Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), including Time-of-Flight SIMS (TOF-SIMS), is a surface-sensitive technique capable of providing spatial distribution maps of elements, including hydrogen [7]. SIMS allows visualization of where hydrogen accumulates within the material microstructure [7], offering insights into potential trapping sites. The use of deuterium as a tracer element, often in combination with hydrogen charging, can help differentiate hydrogen introduced during experiments from background levels and improve detection sensitivity [14,21]. Techniques like Atom Probe Tomography (APT) offer even higher spatial resolution, enabling measurement of hydrogen/deuterium content and distribution at the atomic scale, further enhancing the understanding of trapping at specific microstructural features like precipitate interfaces [14,21]. Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM) provides another approach for in-situ detection of hydrogen trapping at individual nano-precipitates and interfaces [17,19]. While SIMS excels at visualizing hydrogen location, it is generally less quantitative for total bulk hydrogen content and does not directly measure diffusion coefficients or trap energies in the way that permeation tests or TDS do.​  

Comparing these techniques, TDS is particularly effective for measuring total hydrogen content and providing detailed information on trap energies and densities [25,29]. Electrochemical permeation tests are the method of choice for determining hydrogen diffusion coefficients and permeability, as well as providing information on trap density related to transport behavior [2,30]. SIMS offers valuable spatial mapping capabilities, visualizing hydrogen distribution and highlighting potential trapping locations at a microstructural level [7]. Therefore, these methods provide complementary information, often necessitating the use of multiple techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of hydrogen behavior in metals. Other methods, such as the historical hydrogen determinator developed by Mr. Li Xun, have also played a significant role in quantifying total hydrogen content in steel, proving its involvement in fracture events [31,36].  

# 8.2 Microstructural Characterization and Atomic-Scale Probing  

Investigating hydrogen trapping and embrittlement necessitates sophisticated characterization techniques capable of probing material behavior across multiple length scales, from macroscopic fracture features to atomic-scale hydrogen distributions. Techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) serve as foundational tools for characterizing hydrogen-induced microstructural changes and fracture characteristics [25].​  

SEM is widely employed to analyze fracture surfaces, revealing distinct morphologies indicative of hydrogen embrittlement, such as transitions from ductile dimples to brittle cleavage with increasing hydrogen content [3,7]. It is also used in conjunction with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) or energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for elemental analysis, providing insights into chemical segregation that may influence crack propagation [12,17]. SEM assists in visualizing crack paths, often revealing their correlation with specific microstructural features [12,13]. Metallographic microscopy can also visualize larger hydrogen-induced features like acicular hydride phases when hydrogen concentration surpasses a certain threshold [32].​  

TEM, particularly aberration-corrected and environmental variants, provides detailed insights into microstructural features at higher resolution. Aberration-corrected TEM and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) enable characterization of the atomic structure and chemical composition of precipitates and precipitate/matrix interfaces [17,19]. Environmental TEM (ETEM) and in-situ TEM techniques allow for direct observation of microstructural changes, including hydride nucleation and growth, in controlled environments containing hydrogen [5,21].​  

EBSD is invaluable for assessing crystallographic orientation, grain size distribution, and grain boundary characteristics, which are critical microstructural factors influencing hydrogen diffusion and trapping [2,7,25]. EBSD analysis can determine grain size and orientation [25] and assess dislocation density, for instance, through Kernel Average Misorientation (KAM) maps [25]. It is also used to correlate crack propagation paths with local crystallographic features and grain boundary types [12,13].​  

For probing hydrogen distribution and identifying specific trapping sites at the atomic or nanoscale, techniques like atom probe tomography (APT) are particularly powerful [14,19,21,29]. APT offers three-dimensional reconstruction of elemental distributions, allowing visualization and quantification of hydrogen segregated to trapping sites such as grain boundaries and internal defects like dispersoids and precipitate interfaces [12,14]. This atomic-scale resolution is crucial for understanding the local environment and chemical features responsible for hydrogen trapping, such as carbon/sulfur vacancies and strain fields at interfaces [19]. Other techniques like secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) offer microscale characterization of hydrogen behavior [29], while low energy ion spectroscopy (LEIS) can probe hydrogen-surface interactions [5]. Although mentioned as a high-resolution technique for hydrogen characterization, scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) is not detailed with specific hydrogen trapping results in the provided digests. Complementary techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, solid-state NMR, and neutron/X-ray scattering can also provide valuable information on hydrogen interactions within materials [5].  

Despite their power, these techniques face significant challenges, particularly when applied to hydrogen [21]. Hydrogen, being a light element, presents difficulties in detection and quantification due to its low scattering cross-section and potential for re-distribution or loss during specimen preparation and analysis. For APT, specific challenges include achieving sufficient spatial resolution for hydrogen, managing background noise, and ensuring accurate data interpretation due to potential preferential evaporation or ionization of hydrogen [21]. Optimizing site-specific specimen preparation techniques is often critical for obtaining reliable APT data on hydrogen trapping [34]. Similarly, TEM techniques require careful sample preparation to preserve hydrogen distribution, and distinguishing hydrogen's contribution from other light elements or imaging artifacts can be challenging. EBSD is less direct in hydrogen detection but provides essential microstructural context for hydrogen behavior. Addressing these technical challenges is vital for advancing the understanding of hydrogen trapping and its role in embrittlement.​

Mechanical testing techniques are indispensable tools for quantifying the impact of hydrogen on the mechanical properties and fracture behavior of metallic materials [3,25]. These methods provide macroscopic measures of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) susceptibility, which can then be correlated with fundamental mechanisms and hydrogen trapping behavior. Various techniques are employed, each offering unique insights into different aspects of HE.​  

Slow Strain Rate Tensile (SSRT) testing is one of the most widely used techniques for evaluating HE susceptibility [2,7,12,13,28,33]. SSRT involves straining a tensile specimen at a very slow rate, allowing sufficient time for hydrogen to diffuse to critical stress concentration sites ahead of a propagating crack. This technique is particularly effective at revealing hydrogen-induced ductility loss, which is often the most prominent manifestation of embrittlement [28]. Ductility loss can be quantified by comparing the reduction in area or elongation of hydrogen-charged or in-situ hydrogenated samples to that of uncharged reference samples [7,13,25,28]. The Hydrogen Embrittlement Index (HEI or I) is commonly calculated based on the reduction in area, providing a normalized measure of sensitivity [25]. The index I is defined as:​  

$$
I = \frac { F _ { 0 } - F _ { H } } { F _ { 0 } }
$$  

where $\mathsf { F } _ { \circ }$ is the reduction in area of an uncharged sample and F_H is the reduction in area of a hydrogen pre-charged sampl [25]. Similarly, HEI can be calculated as:  

$$
H E I = \frac { \delta _ { 0 } - \delta _ { H } } { \delta _ { 0 } } \times 1 0 0 \
$$  

where $\delta _ { \circ }$ and $\delta _ { - } \mathsf { H }$ are the area reductions of hydrogen-uncharged and hydrogen-charged samples, respectively. Other tensile tests, including conventional and micro-tensile tests, are also employed to assess hydrogen's effect on tensile properties [14,21,25]. In-situ hydrogen charging during tensile testing allows for dynamic observation of hydrogen's influence [34].​  

Beyond tensile testing, other methods provide different perspectives on HE. Fracture toughness testing, including KIC and JIC tests, quantifies the material's resistance to crack propagation in the presence of hydrogen [33]. Fatigue testing evaluates the impact of hydrogen on crack initiation and growth under cyclic loading conditions, which is particularly relevant for components subjected to fluctuating stresses [10,33]. Static load endurance tests assess the time-dependent brittle fracture under continuous stress, revealing incubation periods and subcritical crack propagation behavior [11]. Specialized tests like pre-load testing with parallel support surfaces are designed for specific components such as fasteners, evaluating their integrity under sustained load after hydrogen exposure according to standards like GB/T 3098.17-2000 [22].​  

Hydrogen-Induced Cracking (HIC) testing is a specific method focused on evaluating the susceptibility of steels to cracking in wet hydrogen sulfide $( H _ { 2 } S )$ environments, commonly encountered in oil and gas industries [33]. HIC tests are standardized by various international bodies, including NACE TM0284 (2011, 2016) and GB/T 8650 (2006, 2015) [23,24,33]. These standards specify test procedures, including the composition of the test medium, such as Solution A (saturated $H _ { 2 } S$ in sodium chloride acetic acid) and Solution B (artificial seawater with saturated $H _ { 2 } S$ ) [23], and a typical test duration of 8 working days [23,24]. Standard sample sizes are also defined, with provisions for different thickness ranges [23,24]. The results of HIC tests are evaluated using specific parameters to quantify the extent of cracking: Crack Length Ratio (CLR), Crack Thickness Ratio (CTR), and Crack Sensitivity Ratio (CSR) [23,24,33]. CLR measures the total length of cracks relative to the sample width, CTR assesses the average crack thickness relative to the sample thickness, and CSR indicates the total cracked area relative to the sample cross-sectional area. These ratios provide macroscopic indicators of the material's resistance to HIC under simulated service conditions. While HIC tests are critical for material selection in sour service, they primarily assess through-thickness cracking and may not fully capture complex cracking morphologies or initiation mechanisms.​  

Collectively, these mechanical testing techniques provide essential macroscopic data on material performance in the presence of hydrogen. The quantitative parameters obtained, such as reduction in area, HE index, critical stress intensity factors, and crack sensitivity ratios, serve as crucial metrics for comparing the HE susceptibility of different materials, evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation strategies, and providing experimental data for validating theoretical models and numerical simulations. By correlating these macroscopic measures with hydrogen concentration profiles, trapping site  

characteristics, and microstructural features investigated by other techniques, researchers can gain deeper insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing hydrogen embrittlement.  

# 9. Modeling and Simulation of Hydrogen Embrittlement and Trapping  

![](images/d3a2be57f1e29589f7ed3d4be50a3061a595ba92533b030c94bc85316d041103.jpg)  

Computational modeling and simulation techniques play a crucial role in advancing the understanding and prediction of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) phenomena across different length scales, from atomic interactions to macroscopic structural behavior [10]. These approaches provide complementary insights into the complex interplay between hydrogen, material microstructure, and applied stress.​  

Atomistic simulation methods, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD), are indispensable for probing fundamental interactions at the atomic and nanoscale [9,20]. DFT excels at calculating the energetics of hydrogen within crystal lattices and at specific defect sites, allowing for the prediction of hydrogen trapping energies at locations like vacancies, grain boundaries, interfaces, and precipitates [18,20,26,33]. It provides quantitative data essential for understanding the thermodynamic preference of hydrogen for certain microstructural features and can guide the design of beneficial hydrogen traps [20]. DFT has been successfully applied to study hydrogen solubility in different phases and at grain boundaries, enabling the determination of embrittlement energy [14], as well as the role of specific defects like carbon vacancies in vanadium carbide [18,20]. Comparisons between DFT predictions of diffusion energy barriers and experimental thermal desorption spectroscopy results demonstrate good agreement [18,20]. MD simulations, on the other hand, provide dynamic insights into hydrogen diffusion kinetics and interactions with extended defects like dislocations and nanovoids over somewhat larger length and time scales than typical DFT calculations [9,33]. These methods can capture sequential adsorption processes and interactions between hydrogen atoms on defect surfaces [9] and contribute to understanding mechanisms like hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) [33]. Limitations include the computational cost of DFT for large systems and long times, and the need for accurate interatomic potentials for MD [33].  

In contrast, continuum mechanics models, such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Phase-Field methods, are employed to simulate HE phenomena at mesoscopic and macroscopic scales [6]. FEA is widely used to model hydrogen distribution coupled with mechanical stress, predicting hydrogen accumulation at stress concentration sites crucial for HE initiation and crack propagation [2,6]. By implementing coupled diffusion–mechanics constitutive laws, FEA can estimate local hydrogen concentrations and their impact on mechanical properties [33]. Examples include simulating hydrogen transport, stress fields, and accumulation near inclusions in welds using modified Fick's law [6]. Phase-field modeling is valuable for simulating microstructural evolution, particularly hydrogen-induced phase transformations like hydride formation [21], by coupling order parameters with hydrogen concentration and mechanical fields [33]. While computational thermodynamics (CALPHAD) can guide material design based on phase stability [12], phase-field models capture the kinetics of these transformations and their influence on fracture [33]. Continuum models rely on accurate constitutive laws and material parameters, often derived from lower-scale simulations or experiments, and face challenges in resolving nanoscale phenomena like molecular hydrogen formation or complex nanoscale interactions [9,10].  

Assessing the accuracy and limitations of different models is critical. Atomistic models provide high precision for fundamental interactions but are limited in scale and time. Continuum models capture larger-scale behavior but require well-defined constitutive laws and cannot intrinsically describe nanoscale mechanisms. Bridging these different length scales through multi-scale modeling approaches is a key challenge and a promising direction for predicting HE behavior more comprehensively [9,10]. Such integrated frameworks aim to leverage insights from atomistic simulations to inform mesoscopic and macroscopic models, enabling more accurate predictions of HE in engineering components [10]. Computational expertise and high-performance computing resources are increasingly vital for applying these diverse techniques effectively across multiple length scales [5].​  

# 9.1 Atomistic Modeling (DFT, MD)  

Atomistic simulation techniques, particularly Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Molecular Dynamics (MD), serve as powerful tools for investigating the behavior of hydrogen in metals and alloys at the fundamental atomic scale [2,21,33]. These methods allow researchers to probe metal-hydrogen interactions and defect-hydrogen interactions with high precision, offering insights that complement experimental observations.​  

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely employed to calculate the energetics of hydrogen within crystalline lattices and at various defect sites. A key strength of DFT lies in its ability to predict hydrogen trapping energies, providing quantitative data on the thermodynamic preference of hydrogen for specific locations such as vacancies, interfaces, grain boundaries, and precipitate particles [33]. For instance, DFT calculations have been utilized to investigate hydrogen solubility in different phases, including the S phase and Al3Zr dispersoids in aluminum alloys, as well as at grain boundaries, enabling the determination of hydrogen embrittlement energy by comparing the impact of hydrogen on grain boundary energies versus free surface energies [14]. Furthermore, DFT studies have systematically analyzed hydrogen trapping and diffusion behavior in materials like vanadium carbide, specifically examining the role of different carbon vacancy configurations [18,20]. These calculations demonstrated that carbon vacancies significantly enhance hydrogen adsorption, indicating a propensity for hydrogen accumulation at the vanadium carbide interface [26]. Such findings are crucial for guiding material design towards incorporating beneficial hydrogen traps that can mitigate embrittlement [20]. The predictive capability of DFT for hydrogen diffusion has been validated by comparing calculated diffusion energy barriers inside carbides with experimental thermal desorption spectroscopy results, showing good agreement [18,20]. Beyond trapping, DFT has been applied to understand the effect of strain on hydrogen diffusion and dissolution, the influence of alloying elements (like Cr, Mn, Fe in Ni) on hydrogen solubility under high pressure, the interaction between hydrogen and carbides in bcc iron, and the impact of element segregation on hydrogen behavior at interfaces like Ni/Ni3Al [34]. While powerful for electronic structure and energetic calculations, a limitation of standard DFT is its computational cost, which restricts system size and time scales.  

Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, on the other hand, are particularly well-suited for investigating the kinetics of hydrogen diffusion and its dynamic interactions with extended defects like dislocations and voids over longer time scales compared to typical DFT limits [33]. MD provides insights into diffusion pathways and rates, as well as the mechanisms of defect-assisted hydrogen transport. For example, atomistic models, often based on principles simulated via MD or related techniques, have demonstrated the sequential adsorption of hydrogen adatoms on the surfaces of nanovoids in bcc structures, revealing distinct energy levels associated with different adsorption sites [9]. These simulations can also capture the interaction between hydrogen adatoms, such as pairwise power-law repulsion observed on nanovoid surfaces [9]. MD simulations, sometimes coupled with other methods like elasticity theory (e.g., for diffusion in the elastic fields around dislocations) [34], can offer dynamic perspectives on hydrogen movement and accumulation, contributing to the understanding of mechanisms like hydrogen-enhanced localized plasticity (HELP) and hydrogen-enhanced decohesion (HEDE) [33]. A primary challenge for MD is the requirement for accurate interatomic potentials (force fields) that reliably describe metal-hydrogen interactions across various environments and the inherent time scale limitations compared to macroscopic diffusion processes.​  

In summary, DFT excels at predicting hydrogen energetics, trapping sites, and guiding the design of beneficial traps based on quantum mechanical interactions, while MD provides dynamic insights into hydrogen diffusion kinetics and interaction with defects over larger length and time scales. The combined application of these atomistic methods offers a comprehensive approach to understanding hydrogen behavior and its role in embrittlement.​  

# 9.2 Continuum Modeling (FEA, Phase-Field)  

Continuum modeling approaches, notably Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Phase-Field methods, provide valuable tools for understanding hydrogen embrittlement (HE) by simulating processes occurring at macroscopic and mesoscopic scales. FEA is widely employed to model hydrogen distribution within metallic structures, particularly focusing on the interplay between mechanical stress and hydrogen diffusion [2]. This method can simulate hydrogen diffusion coupled with  

mechanical stress to predict the accumulation of hydrogen at stress concentrations, which are critical sites for HE initiation [6]. By incorporating coupled diffusion–mechanics constitutive models, FEA simulations can estimate hydrogen concentrations and their potential influence on local mechanical properties and overall fracture risk in hydrogen-charged materials [33]. For instance, FEA has been utilized to simulate hydrogen transport, stress distribution, and hydrogen accumulation near inclusions in steel welds, accounting for stress-assisted diffusion through a modified Fick’s law [6]. These simulations are instrumental in predicting where hydrogen accumulation is most likely to occur under service conditions, thus indicating areas susceptible to embrittlement [6].  

Phase‐field modeling offers a powerful approach for simulating complex microstructural evolution driven by local thermodynamic states and kinetics, making it particularly relevant for materials where hydrogen induces phase transformations, such as the formation of hydrides in titanium alloys or niobium [21]. While the provided digests mention the use of phase diagrams and computational thermodynamics (CALPHAD) to guide material design based on phase stability [1] and thermodynamic modeling for understanding phase stabilities in hydrogen systems [21], phase‐field modeling extends this by simulating the kinetics of these phase transformations, including hydride formation and growth, and evaluating their impact on fracture behavior [33]. By defining order parameters that represent the phase state and coupling them with hydrogen concentration and mechanical fields, phase‐field models can capture the dynamic process of hydride precipitation and its subsequent influence on the material’s mechanical response and fracture path.​  

Despite their capabilities, these continuum approaches face challenges in fully capturing the complexity of HE phenomena. FEA, while effective for stress–diffusion coupling, relies heavily on accurate constitutive laws and material parameters that may need to be determined from experiments or lower-scale simulations. Phase‐field models require careful calibration of energy functionals and mobility parameters, often derived from thermodynamic data and kinetic information. Furthermore, phenomena like hydrogen molecule formation in nanovoids [9] or the intricate nanoscale interactions proposed in the HESIV framework [10] occur at length scales significantly smaller than those typically resolved by continuum models. Bridging these scales and integrating insights from atomistic or mesoscopic simulations remains a key challenge for continuum‐based predictions of hydrogen embrittlement, highlighting the need for potential multiscale modeling approaches or simplified, unified models that can encompass diverse mechanisms across different scales [10].

Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) presents critical challenges across diverse engineering applications, necessitating tailored approaches to material selection, design, and mitigation [10,28]. The susceptibility of materials to HE is intrinsically linked to the specific operating conditions, which often involve exposure to hydrogenated environments, temperature variations, corrosive media, radiation, and various loading types such as monotonic and cyclic stress [10,28]. Hydrogen can ingress into metallic components during fabrication processes, cathodic protection, or corrosion [28]. Despite ongoing research and mitigation efforts, HE continues to be a cause of unpredictable failures in numerous critical components [28].  

Hydrogen storage and transportation systems are particularly vulnerable to HE due to direct exposure to high-pressure hydrogen [28]. Components such as storage tanks, pipelines, and pressure vessels are subjected to significant stresses, including cyclic loading during pressure changes [5,28,33]. Materials commonly employed in these systems include various steels, such as pipeline steel [2,6], and austenitic stainless steels [5,7], as well as composite materials [5]. Pipeline steel is known to be susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement [2], with specific challenges identified in pipeline welds due to factors like inclusions affecting hydrogen diffusion behavior [6]. For cryo-compressed hydrogen storage onboard fuel cell vehicles, the compatibility of composite materials, austenitic steels, and weld materials under cryogenic conditions (30 K) is actively being evaluated [5]. Challenges are also noted in underground hydrogen storage systems, such as lined rock caverns, concerning key components and HE [34], and in Type IV hydrogen storage vessels regarding liner collapse mechanisms [34]. Addressing the HE susceptibility of pipeline steels and welds under various service conditions remains a key area for research and mitigation strategy development [2,6].  

In the oil and gas industry, HE is a significant concern, particularly in pipelines and related components exposed to corrosive environments like wet $H _ { 2 } S$ [23,24]. This environment promotes hydrogen sulfide stress cracking (SOHIC) and hydrogeninduced cracking (HIC) in carbon steel components [23]. Pipeline steel is a critical material in this sector [24,33], and components like pressure vessel steel plates, flanges, fittings, oil drill pipes, valves, and petrochemical accessories are all susceptible to HIC [33]. Mitigation strategies in this sector include the selection of HIC-resistant materials and specific testing protocols [33].​  

Nuclear power plants also utilize materials potentially susceptible to HE. For instance, austenitic stainless steels, such as 304, are employed in piping systems [7], which may be exposed to environments where hydrogen ingress is possible.  

The automotive and aerospace industries rely heavily on high-strength materials to meet weight and performance requirements, making them susceptible to HE [1,19]. High-strength steels [1,19] and high-strength aluminum alloys [14] are used in structural components. Specific concerns include laser-welded joints in advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) like QP980 used in car bodies, where the welding process can influence HE susceptibility [13]. Historical examples, such as the failure of a main shaft in a British Royal Air Force Spitfire due to HIC, underscore the critical nature of preventing HE in aerospace applications [31]. Components like aircraft parts, fuel cell vehicle components, and fasteners are among those susceptible [5,28,31]. Research in these areas includes investigating crack resistance enhancement mechanisms in highperformance steels containing metastable austenite, such as TRIP-assisted AHSS, metastable stainless steels, and martensitic TRIP steels [1], revealing atomic-scale hydrogen trapping mechanisms at nanoprecipitate interfaces in highstrength steels [19], and providing new insights for high-strength aluminum alloy design to mitigate HE [14].  

Beyond these sectors, process reactors and fasteners are other examples of components where HE can lead to failure [28]. The pervasive nature of HE across such a wide range of applications highlights the need for continued research into application-specific mechanisms, material behaviors under relevant operating conditions, and the development of effective, reliable mitigation strategies. Further work is needed to fully understand and prevent unpredictable failures caused by hydrogen across all these critical engineering domains.  

# 11. Conclusion and Future Directions  

This review has synthesized current knowledge on hydrogen embrittlement (HE) and hydrogen trapping in metals, highlighting their profound implications for the reliability and structural integrity of materials used in hydrogen infrastructure and other critical applications [10]. The transport of hydrogen via pipelines, a key component of the burgeoning hydrogen economy, remains significantly challenged by HE phenomena [2,4]. Delayed hydrogen-induced cracking (HIC), particularly prevalent in welded structures, poses a significant threat, demanding heightened attention for safety and reliability [35,36]. Effective strategies for managing HE are thus crucial for advancing hydrogen technologies and ensuring the longevity of critical components [10].​  

Despite significant progress in understanding HE mechanisms and the role of hydrogen trapping, several key research gaps and unresolved questions persist. A complete theoretical framework for HE remains elusive [8]. Specific challenges include accurately characterizing hydrogen behavior in complex microstructures [6], understanding the intricate interplay of  

multiple HE mechanisms which has gained increasing attention [3], and improving the accuracy of predictive models for hydrogen distribution and cracking risk, particularly in weldments influenced by residual stress and inclusions [6,9,10,17]. Furthermore, the long-term effectiveness of various mitigation strategies and the hydrogen embrittlement sensitivity of specific materials like stainless steels under different charging conditions require further investigation [7]. The combined effects of hydrogen content and microstructural features, such as grain size in ultra-fine grained materials, on fracture modes also warrant detailed future studies [25]. Critical applications require elimination of hydrogen from metals through methods like de-hydrogen treatment, especially for susceptible materials and components [31]. Mitigation of HIC in corrosive environments like those containing H2S also requires dedicated research focus [23].​  

Addressing these challenges necessitates pursuing several promising research directions. Exploring novel hydrogen trapping materials and strategies holds significant potential. This includes intentionally designing chemical heterogeneity in materials, such as creating Mn-rich regions, which has shown promise in enhancing HE resistance by manipulating solute distribution and potentially forming effective barriers to crack propagation [1,12]. Utilizing nanosized precipitates like VC, TiC, and NbC as potent hydrogen traps is another crucial approach for designing HE-resistant high-strength steels [26]. Recent research has provided atomic-scale insights into hydrogen trapping and exclusion at nano-precipitate interfaces, highlighting the importance of controlling interface characteristics [17,19]. Furthermore, the potential to enhance hydrogen trapping capabilities by controlling carbon vacancy networks in materials like vanadium carbide presents a novel material design strategy [18].​  

Beyond material design, advancing characterization and modeling techniques is paramount. Developing advanced in-situ characterization techniques is crucial for accurate measurement of hydrogen distribution and hydrogen-induced crack initiation in real-time [10]. Integrating multi-scale modeling approaches, combining atomic-scale simulations with computational simulations, is essential for perfecting physics-based HE quantification mechanisms and developing predictive models that incorporate complex factors like microstructure, stress, and atomic-scale interactions [4,6,17,19]. The increasing application of machine learning and big data is expected to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of simulations, optimize experiments, and aid in material design, representing a major future trend [10].  

Finally, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations across materials science, mechanics, chemistry, and engineering is vital to develop comprehensive solutions. This includes establishing standardized hydrogen embrittlement testing protocols, material selection criteria, and structural design guidelines [10,33]. Initiatives focused on sharing nonproprietary data publicly, such as those by H-Mat, can significantly accelerate research and development in materials compatibility for hydrogen technologies [5]. Continued research focusing on enhancing resistance to hydrogen-induced damage and improving the lifespan of critical components is essential for the sustainable deployment of hydrogen energy systems and other demanding applications [14].​
