# 1. Introduction  

The increasing global demand for high-performance electronic devices, particularly those requiring flexibility, transparency, and miniaturization, has driven a critical need for advanced materials beyond conventional options [21,25,26,37]. Traditional semiconductor materials like silicon are approaching fundamental physical limits, such as the short-channel effect at sub-10 nm process nodes, alongside increasing manufacturing costs, hindering further advancements in computing power and device miniaturization [7,11,33,44]. Similarly, established transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) like indiumdoped tin oxide (ITO) suffer from brittleness, high cost, and scarcity, limiting their suitability for flexible and cost-sensitive applications [22,26].​  

In this context, two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as highly promising candidates capable of addressing these limitations [6,7,8,12,13,17,24,30,31,38,41,45]. Defined as novel crystalline materials with single or few atomic layer thickness [30,31,45], 2D materials exhibit exceptional and often unique physical and chemical properties distinct from their bulk counterparts, including high carrier mobility, remarkable mechanical strength and flexibility, tunable electronic characteristics, high thermal conductivity, and optical transparency [3,5,7,17,24,28,33,34,36]. Notable examples include graphene with its ultra-high electron mobility $\mathrm { ( > 1 0 0 0 0 0 c m ^ { 2 } \cdot V ^ { - 1 } \cdot s ^ { - 1 } }$ ) [24,44], transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with tunable bandgaps and strong excitonic responses [24,33,36], borophene with exceptional conductivity and tunable bandgap [34], and MXenes $( T i _ { 3 } C _ { 2 } )$ ) known for high conductivity and suitability for flexible electronics [3,22,28]. Other relevant 2D materials include hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), black phosphorus (BP), and perovskites [31], as well as metal oxide nanosheets [30] and carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs, MWCNTs) [21,32].  

Leveraging these properties, the application of 2D materials specifically as coatingspresents a disruptive technology with the potential to revolutionize various industries, particularly electronics [9]. 2D material coatings can enhance performance by providing electrical conductivity, thermal management [5], and mechanical robustness, while also enabling new functionalities such as transparency, flexibility, and corrosion resistance [9,18,22,25,26,32]. Their large specific surface areas make them suitable for various film fabrication techniques like spin-coating and ink-jet printing [30], and solution-based processing routes are being developed for scalable synthesis [39]. The ability to tune properties via surface modification and functionalization further expands their utility [30]. Applications range from transparent electrodes in displays and solar cells [22,26], active layers in photodetectors [21], conductive layers in wearable e-textiles for health monitoring [18,25,32], to protective barriers against oxidation [9].  

Despite the immense potential, the widespread adoption of conductive 2D material coatings faces several challenges. These include achieving cost-effective and scalable mass production with consistent high quality [9,20,25,34,39], integrating 2D materials seamlessly with existing fabrication processes like CMOS technology [2,11], controlling material structure and properties at the atomic or few-layer level [20], and overcoming performance limitations such as insufficient second harmonic generation efficiency in TMDs [36] or the prevalence of n-type conductivity in many 2D semiconductors [33]. Challenges specific to coating applications include achieving high transparency, low sheet resistance, and mechanical flexibility simultaneously [26], and ensuring long-term stability and reproducibility [32]. Nevertheless, significant opportunities lie in the growing demand across various sectors such as energy, automotive, healthcare (wearables), and the accelerating pace of technological advancements and research and development efforts [9,25]. The development of seamless atomic interfaces and advanced fabrication techniques like direct laser fabrication and solution-based methods are paving the way for future innovations [31,38,39].​  

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of conductive 2D materials used as coatings for electronic applications. We will begin by discussing the fundamental properties of key conductive 2D materials. Subsequent sections will delve into synthesis and fabrication techniques tailored for coatings, analyze their electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties in thin-film or composite forms, explore their diverse applications in electronic devices including flexible electronics, sensors, and energy storage, and finally, highlight the current challenges and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.  

# 2. Fundamentals and Types of Conductive 2D Materials  

The realm of conductive two-dimensional (2D) materials encompasses a diverse array of ultrathin substances, typically ranging from one to several nanometers in thickness, where electron movement is predominantly confined to two dimensions [44]. These materials possess unique electronic, thermal, mechanical, optical, and chemical properties that render them highly suitable for applications as conductive coatings in advanced electronics [3,5,6,9,10,12,14,28,29,34,41,44].

Based on their composition and structure, these conductive 2D materials can be broadly classified into categories such as graphene and its derivatives, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MXenes, metal oxides, metal nanowires, and other emerging materials including elemental 2D materials and conductive polymers [13,17,30].  

Graphene, the foundational 2D material, consists of a single layer of $s p ^ { 2 }$ hybridized carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice [8,13,43]. This structure results in remarkable properties: it is a semi-metal with ultra-high carrier mobility (up to $2 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } \ c m ^ { 2 } V ^ { - 1 } s ^ { - 1 } .$ ) and exceptional electrical and thermal conductivity (exceeding $2 0 0 0 \ W m ^ { - 1 } K ^ { - 1 }$ ) [5,6,28,44]. Graphene is also mechanically robust, being roughly 200 times stronger than steel while remaining highly flexible and nearly transparent [6,9,13,41]. Derivatives like graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) offer tunable properties; GO is electrically insulating but highly dispersible, useful for dielectrics and solution processing, while rGO is partially conductive, balancing properties for flexible electronics despite some performance compromises compared to pristine graphene [4,12,18,21,25]. A key challenge for graphene in semiconductor applications is its zero band gap, which is being addressed through methods to induce an adjustable bandgap [12,13,24,44].  

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) feature a layered structure, commonly expressed as $M X Y _ { 2 }$ ​ (where M is metal, X is chalcogen) [17,38]. Their electronic properties span from semiconducting (e.g., $\mathsf { M o S } _ { 2 } , \mathsf { W S e } _ { 2 } )$ ) to metallic, with tunable band gaps and strong light-matter interaction, making them suitable for transistors and optoelectronics [11,24,44]. The structural phase (e.g., 2H, 1T′) significantly impacts both electrical and mechanical characteristics [31,40]. Janus TMDs (e.g., MoSSe) with their asymmetric structure exhibit unique thermal transport properties [14]. Conductivity in semiconducting TMDs is often enhanced via doping or defect engineering [24,38].  

MXenes, derived from MAX phases, possess a general formula $M _ { n + 1 } X _ { n } T _ { x }$ ​ after etching, where $T _ { x }$ ​ denotes surface terminations [28,30]. They are intrinsically metallic conductors with tunable conductivity and work function influenced by composition and surface chemistry [12,17,28]. Their hydrophilicity facilitates facile solution processing, and they exhibit mechanical flexibility [3,12,17,28]. A challenge is the stacking tendency of delaminated sheets, which can be addressed using strategies like adding polymers [17]. MXenes are promising for transparent conductive coatings, often used in composites for enhanced performance [22].​  

Metal oxides, such as layered $M o O _ { 3 }$ ​ or exfoliated nanosheets like $K _ { 0 . 8 } O _ { 4 }$ ​ , $K C a _ { 2 } N b _ { 3 } O _ { 1 0 }$ ​ , and $K _ { 0 . 4 5 } M n O _ { 2 }$ ​ , can be processed into 2D forms via top-down or bottom-up methods [26,30]. Their properties vary widely, serving as dielectrics ( $M o O _ { x }$ ​ , $S n O _ { 2 }$ ​ ), electron transport layers (ZnO), or components in electrochemical energy storage (TMOs, LDHs) [17,22,26]. While some TMOs and LDHs show high capacitance potential, their inherent poor conductivity often necessitates combination with conductive materials [17]. Emerging Bismuth-based materials like $\mathsf { B i } _ { \mathsf { \Omega } _ { 2 } } \mathsf { O } _ { 2 } \mathsf { S } \mathsf { e }$ offer ultrahigh carrier mobility, a moderate band gap, and exceptional stability, alongside excellent mechanical properties and ferroelectricity, making them promising for next-generation devices [7].​  

Metal nanowires, particularly silver nanowires (AgNWs), form conductive networks on surfaces, presenting a cost-effective alternative for transparent conductive electrodes [10]. Synthesized via wet chemical routes, their performance hinges on nanowire dimensions and network characteristics like density, which dictates the trade-off between conductivity and optical transparency [10]. AgNW networks are used alone or in composites for transparent electrodes [10,22,42].  

Beyond these, a variety of other materials are emerging. Borophene, a 2D allotrope of boron, shows high carrier mobility, conductivity, and flexibility [29,34]. Black phosphorus (BP) is a $\mathsf { p }$ -type semiconductor with an adjustable bandgap, explored for transistors and energy storage, although stability remains a concern [17,33,44]. Two-dimensional metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with large $\pi - \pi$ systems are investigated for electrochemical applications [17]. Conductive polymers, like recently synthesized 2D polyaniline crystals, demonstrate potential for achieving metal-level conductivity through ordered structures, offering flexibility and potentially lower costs [1].  

Comparing these materials, graphene excels in intrinsic electrical and thermal conductivity and mechanical strength, but its zero bandgap and processability can be limitations. TMDs offer tunable bandgaps suitable for semiconductor devices but typically have lower conductivity. MXenes combine metallic conductivity with facile solution processability and flexibility, though stability can be an issue. Metal oxides offer a range of properties and applications, from dielectrics to components in composites. Metal nanowires provide a balance of conductivity and transparency via networks, offering cost-effectiveness. Emerging materials like borophene and conductive polymers explore new property combinations and processing routes [3,10,12,13,17,28]. The relationship between structure (e.g., lattice type, layer number, surface termination, network formation) and properties is paramount, enabling the tailoring of electronic, thermal, mechanical, and optical behaviors for specific electronic coating requirements [3,10,14,17,28,29]. Challenges across these material classes include achieving  

scalable synthesis of high-quality, uniform films, optimizing processability, ensuring long-term stability, and further understanding and controlling interface properties for seamless integration into functional electronic devices. Future research directions involve exploring new 2D material compositions, developing advanced fabrication techniques, and creating heterostructures and composites that leverage the complementary advantages of different materials.  

# 2.1 Graphene and its Derivatives  

Graphene stands as the archetypal two-dimensional (2D) material, consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice [13,20]. This structure is formed by $s p ^ { 2 }$ hybridized carbon atoms with a carbon–carbon bond distance of approximately 1.42 Å [8,30,43]. A single layer of graphene has a theoretical thickness of about 0.355 nanometers [13]. Unlike bulk graphite, where layers are held together by van der Waals forces at a distance of around $3 . 3 5 \mathring { \mathsf { A } }$ [30], graphene’s intrinsic properties emerge from its isolated 2D nature.​  

The electronic structure of graphene is particularly noteworthy. Classified as a semi-metal, it exhibits a zero band gap, allowing electrons to move with minimal energy loss and behave as if they have no mass [12,24]. This unique electronic behavior contributes to graphene’s outstanding electrical conductivity and exceptionally high carrier mobility. Room temperature carrier mobility values reported in the literature are as high as approximately $1 5 0 0 0 \ c m ^ { 2 } / ( V \cdot s )$ [13], $5 5 0 0 ~ c m ^ { 2 } / ( V \cdot s )$ [44], and even up to $2 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } \ c m ^ { 2 } V ^ { - 1 } s ^ { - 1 }$ [28], significantly exceeding that of silicon (approximately $1 4 0 0 ~ c m ^ { 2 } / ( V \cdot s ) )$ [44]. Graphene’s electrical conductivity is reported to be $7 0 \%$ higher than that of copper [6], contributing to its promise for high-speed electronic components and transistors [41,44].  

Beyond its electronic properties, graphene possesses remarkable thermal and mechanical characteristics. Its thermal conductivity can exceed $2 0 0 0 \ W m ^ { - 1 } K ^ { - 1 }$ at room temperature [5], with some reports indicating values as high as $5 3 0 0 W / ( m \cdot K )$ , which is roughly 10 times greater than silicon [44]. This rapid heat conduction [12] is crucial for thermal management in electronics [5,44]. Mechanically, graphene is one of the thinnest yet hardest nanomaterials [41]. It boasts a theoretical Young’s modulus of up to 1.0 TPa and an intrinsic tensile strength of 130 GPa [13], described elsewhere as an exceptional mechanical strength of $1 1 0 0 \mathsf { G P a }$ [9]. Graphene is approximately 200 times stronger than steel while being significantly lighter [6,9]. The flexible nature of the carbon atom connections allows for bending and deformation while maintaining structural stability [13,43], making it suitable for flexible electronics and textiles [17,18,44]. Graphene also exhibits excellent optical properties, being nearly transparent with an absorption rate of only about $2 . 3 \%$ across a wide wavelength range from near-infrared to ultraviolet [13,24,28,41].​  

Graphene derivatives, such as graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), represent modifications of pristine graphene that offer tunable properties for various applications [6,12,18]. Graphene oxide is produced by oxidizing graphite, introducing oxygen-containing functional groups [6]. This process disrupts the $s p ^ { 2 }$ network, transforming GO into an electrical insulator [21]. The presence of functional groups also renders GO highly dispersible in polar solvents like water, which is advantageous for solution-based processing methods and interaction with textile fibers for stable coatings [25]. GO has been utilized as a dielectric layer in electronic devices [21] and can aid in heat dissipation [12].​  

Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is obtained by removing most of the oxygen functional groups from GO through chemical, thermal, or other reduction processes [4,31]. This reduction process partially restores the electrical conductivity by recovering the $s p ^ { 2 }$ carbon network. However, rGO often contains residual defects and functional groups, resulting in properties that differ from pristine graphene. Specifically, rGO is noted as being less effective for thermal transport compared to few-layer graphene due to phonon scattering issues, although it can achieve high electrical conductivity suitable for applications like conductive textiles and electrodes via percolation [4,12,18]. Graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) are thicker stacks of graphene layers [6,18] used, for example, to enhance the strength of materials [12]. The scalable graphite oxide route is a popular method for producing GO and rGO due to its high yield, good colloidal stability of GO, and excellent dispersibility, which facilitates large-scale material production [25].​  

A significant challenge for utilizing graphene in semiconductor applications is its intrinsic zero band gap [12,13,24], which makes it difficult to switch transistors off effectively. To address this limitation, various strategies are explored in the field. While specific methods like doping, functionalization, or quantum dots for opening a band gap are not detailed in all relevant digests, the potential for property tuning through such means is acknowledged. For instance, heteroatom doping and functionalization are mentioned as methods to improve graphene’s electrochemical performance and effective surface area by preventing aggregation and introducing pseudocapacitance [17]. More recently, a breakthrough achieving an adjustable bandgap in functional graphene semiconductors has been reported, signifying progress towards overcoming this fundamental limitation for applications in high-speed computing and AI acceleration [44].  

Comparing different forms of graphene, pristine single-layer or few-layer graphene excels in preserving the intrinsic high carrier mobility, thermal conductivity, and mechanical strength crucial for high-performance electronic and thermal management coatings [4,5,13]. However, pristine graphene’s tendency to aggregate due to strong van der Waals forces can reduce its effective surface area and impact performance in applications requiring high surface area, such as supercapacitors, a challenge addressed by methods like assembling 3D structures or using interlayer spacers [17,25]. Oxidized forms like GO offer excellent dispersibility and insulating properties suitable for dielectric layers [21,25], while rGO provides a balance of conductivity and processability, making it viable for conductive coatings in flexible and wearable electronics despite having somewhat compromised intrinsic properties compared to pristine graphene [4,18]. The choice between pristine graphene and its derivatives for coatings depends critically on the desired properties, ease of processing, and application requirements. For example, for highly conductive or thermal coatings, preserving the intrinsic properties of few-layer graphene is preferred [4], while for applications needing stable dispersions or insulating layers, GO is more suitable [21,25].​  

# 2.2 Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs)  

Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) constitute a significant class of two-dimensional (2D) materials characterized by their layered structure, akin to graphene [17]. This layered arrangement, consisting of a transition metal layer sandwiched between two chalcogen atom layers, gives rise to a diverse range of electronic properties and tunable band gaps [38]. The electronic nature of TMDs varies significantly, ranging from semiconducting to metallic depending on their composition and structure.​  

Common semiconducting TMDs include Molybdenum disulfide $( M O S _ { 2 } )$ , Tungsten disulfide (WS₂), Molybdenum diselenide $( M O S e _ { 2 } )$ , and Tungsten diselenide $( W S e _ { 2 } )$ [11,44]. Monolayer $M O S _ { 2 }$ , for instance, is widely recognized as an n-type semiconductor, primarily due to the presence of intrinsic sulfur vacancy defects [24]. In its monolayer form, $M O S _ { 2 }$ exhibits direct band gap characteristics and strong light–matter interaction, forming tightly bound excitons and trions [24]. The absorption spectrum of monolayer $M O S _ { 2 }$ features distinct peaks corresponding to exciton A, exciton B, and trion $\mathsf { A } \boxtimes$ [24]. The energy difference between exciton A and exciton B arises from valence band splitting at the K-point due to spin–orbit coupling [24]. The binding energies of excitons can be substantial, reportedly up to $5 0 0 \mathrm { m e V }$ for $M O S _ { 2 }$ at room temperature, with trion binding energies around $2 0 \mathsf { m e V }$ [24]. $\mathsf { W S e } _ { 2 }$ , conversely, is typically identified as a $\mathsf { p }$ -type TMD [33]. The distinct ntype behavior of $M O S _ { 2 }$ and p-type behavior of ${ \mathsf { W S e } } _ { 2 }$ make them suitable candidates for complementary CMOS logic applications [11]. Beyond these, some TMDs like monolayer $\mathsf { V S e } _ { 2 }$ and $V S _ { 2 }$ are theoretically predicted to exhibit intrinsic ferromagnetism with Curie temperatures exceeding room temperature, showing spin polarization valuable for spintronics and valleytronics [37]. $\mathsf { C r T e } _ { 2 }$ is another TMD explored for its magnetic properties and spintronic potential, demonstrating magnetic behavior influenced by its granular structure [2]. TMDs like $M O S _ { 2 }$ , $V S _ { 2 }$ , and $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { W S } } _ { 2 }$ also show promise for electrochemical applications such as supercapacitors due to high conductivity, large specific surface area, and capacitance properties [17].​  

The structural phase of TMDs significantly impacts both their electrical and mechanical properties [40]. For example, MoTe₂ exists in semiconducting hexagonal (2H) and metallic monoclinic (1T′) phases [31]. The mechanical properties of TMD monolayers like $M O S _ { 2 }$ , $\mathsf { M o S e } _ { 2 }$ , $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { W S } } _ { 2 }$ , and $W S e _ { 2 }$ show a strong correlation with their structural phases (1H, $\mathsf { 1 T ^ { \prime } }$ , and 1H/1T′ heterostructures), suggesting structural engineering as a route to tune material stiffness [40]. While lateral heterostructures can affect mechanical strength, their influence across the studied TMDs is generally weak [40]. The formation of heterophase homojunctions, such as the ohmic contact between 2H and 1T′ MoTe₂ fabricated via laser thinning, has been shown to dramatically enhance carrier mobility while maintaining a high on/off current ratio, demonstrating the critical role of structural phase control in device performance [31]. Structural phases also influence charge transport and can be involved in forming van der Waals heterostructures with distinct properties like artificial ferroelectricity [15].  

Enhancing the conductivity of TMDs is crucial for electronic applications. Strategies to achieve this include doping, defect engineering, and strain engineering [38]. As noted, intrinsic sulfur vacancy defects contribute to the n-type conductivity of $M O S _ { 2 }$ [24]. Chemical functionalization offers another pathway to control the properties and interfaces of TMDs, enabling symmetric or asymmetric modifications that can impart new functionalities [19]. Agglomeration of TMD nanosheets can reduce active sites and decrease capacitance in supercapacitors, which can be mitigated by forming composites or 3D structures to increase active surface area [17].​  

A unique subset of TMDs are the Janus TMDs, such as MoSSe, characterized by their asymmetric structure where the two chalcogen layers are different elements (e.g., MXY, where M is the metal, and X and Y are different chalcogens) [14]. This structural asymmetry leads to distinctive physical properties, including an impact on phonon thermal transport, which is a subject of investigation using first-principles calculations [14]. The inherent noncentrosymmetry of monolayer TMDs also results in high second-order nonlinear susceptibility, making them promising for nonlinear optical applications [36]. Studies on $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { W S } } _ { 2 }$ monolayers, for instance, investigate their refractive indices and nonlinear susceptibility components relevant for applications like second harmonic generation [36]. Precise synthesis methods, such as the two-step flux synthesis for ultrapure TMDs or techniques like molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) for growing p-type W $S e _ { 2 }$ , are vital for obtaining highquality materials suitable for device fabrication [15,33]. Furthermore, techniques like direct laser fabrication allow for deterministic preparation and patterning of monolayer TMDs such as $M O S _ { 2 }$ , $\mathsf { W S e } _ { 2 }$ , and $\mathsf { M o T e } _ { 2 }$ , which is essential for exploiting their properties in monolayer devices [31].  

# 2.3 MXenes  

MXenes constitute a new family of two-dimensional (2D) materials derived from MAX phases, which possess the general formula $M _ { n + 1 } A X _ { n }$ , where M represents an early transition metal, A is an element from groups 12–16 (or IIIA or IVA), and X is carbon and/or nitrogen, with $n$ typically being 1, 2, or 3 [28,30]. The synthesis of MXenes is typically achieved through the selective etching of the A layer from the layered MAX phase using strong acid solutions [28,30]. This process results in 2D structures with formulae such as $M _ { 2 } X$ , $M _ { 3 } X _ { 2 }$ ​ , or $M _ { 4 } X _ { 3 }$ ​ [30]. A significant outcome of this chemical etching is the surface termination of MXenes by various functional groups $( T _ { x } )$ , commonly including oxygen (-O), fluorine (-F), and hydroxyl (-OH) groups [12,17]. These surface functional groups are crucial as they significantly influence the properties of the resulting MXene materials [17].​  

MXenes are known for their metallic conductivity [12,17,28]. Their electronic properties, including conductivity and work function, can be tuned by varying the constituent M and X elements, the number of layers $( n )$ , and critically, the surface chemistry $( T _ { x }$ ) [12,28]. The presence of unsaturated surface functional groups also facilitates processes like electron transfer and carrier injection, which is advantageous for electronic applications [22]. Beyond conductivity, these surface groups impart hydrophilicity [17,28] and can influence the stability of the nanosheets. A notable challenge, particularly for $T i _ { 3 } C _ { 2 } T _ { x }$ ​ , is the tendency for single-layer sheets to stack, which can negatively impact performance in certain applications, such as electrochemical energy storage [17]. Strategies like adding polar polymers, such as PDDA and PVA, or conductive polymers like polypyrrole (PPy), can effectively prevent aggregation and enhance mechanical properties [17].  

The metallic conductivity and 2D nature of MXenes make them promising candidates for transparent conductive coatings [28]. However, achieving an optimal balance between high conductivity and sufficient transparency remains a challenge [22]. For instance, in transparent quantum dot light-emitting diodes (T-QLEDs), $T i _ { 3 } C _ { 2 } T _ { x }$ ​ alone, despite its conductivity and transparency, requires combination with materials like $\mathsf { A g }$ nanowires (NWs) to function effectively as a top electrode [22].  

Furthermore, MXenes, particularly $T i _ { 3 } C _ { 2 }$ ​ nanosheets, exhibit favorable mechanical properties [12], which are highly relevant for flexible electronic applications [3]. Their combination of metallic conductivity, mechanical flexibility, and solution processability [12] positions them as a material of choice for future flexible electronics, energy storage, and electromechanical nanodevices [3].  

Compared to other 2D materials like graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MXenes offer distinct advantages and disadvantages. Advantages include their inherent metallic conductivity (unlike some TMDs which are semiconductors), facile solution processability enabled by their hydrophilicity and surface functional groups, and a tunable work function [12,17]. These characteristics make them particularly attractive for various solution-based fabrication techniques. A primary disadvantage, however, lies in their stability, particularly the propensity for stacking of delaminated sheets, which requires specific material engineering approaches to mitigate [17]. While graphene is highly stable and conductive, its hydrophobic nature can pose challenges for solution processing compared to hydrophilic MXenes. TMDs offer a wider range of electronic properties (semiconducting, metallic) but often require more complex synthesis routes or exhibit lower conductivity than metallic MXenes. Overall, the unique combination of metallic conductivity, mechanical properties, and facile processing makes MXenes a competitive and complementary material system within the 2D material landscape for conductive coatings and flexible electronics.​  

# 2.4 Metal Oxides and Bismuth-Based Materials  

Two-dimensional (2D) metal oxide nanosheets represent a significant class of materials with diverse properties relevant to advanced electronics. These materials can be synthesized through various approaches, including top‐down exfoliation of layered bulk precursors and bottom‐up methods [30]. Layered bulk oxides, such as metal trioxides like $M o O _ { 3 }$ ​ $\mathrm { . } M = M _ { 0 }$ , Ta), possess structures consisting of distorted $M o O _ { 6 }$ ​ octahedra that share edges to form 2D layers [30]. These layers are weakly held together by van der Waals forces along the z-axis, facilitating exfoliation into nanosheets [30]. Other examples of layered oxides amenable to exfoliation include lepidocrocite-type $K _ { 0 . 8 } O _ { 4 }$ ​ , the Dion–Jacobson phase $K C a _ { 2 } N b _ { 3 } O _ { 1 0 }$ ​ , and $K _ { 0 . 4 5 } M n O _ { 2 }$ ​ , which feature negatively charged 2D oxide planes separated by intercalated potassium ions [30].  

Bottom-up methods, such as solution processing and thermal evaporation, are also employed for depositing specific metal oxides as thin films or nanoparticles [26]. For instance, solution processing was used for $S n O _ { 2 }$ ​ , while thermal evaporation was utilized for $M o O _ { x }$ in studies optimizing optoelectronic properties for transparent electrodes [26]. Similarly, Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles, typically synthesized via bottom-up techniques, have been used as electron transport layers in quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs), exhibiting excellent dispersibility and facilitating efficient electron transport due to their small particle size (approximately $5 . 9 \mathsf { n m }$ ) [22].​  

2D metal oxide nanosheets find varied applications in both electronics and energy storage [30]. In electronics, they serve roles such as seed layers to promote the growth of other materials, as demonstrated by the use of a Bi2Te3 seed layer for the epitaxial growth of CrTe2 films [2]. They can also function as dielectric layers, exemplified by the use of $M o O _ { x }$ ​ and $S n O _ { 2 }$ ​ in flexible transparent electrodes [26], or as electron transport layers in optoelectronic devices [22]. In energy storage, specifically in electrochemical applications, transition metal oxides (TMOs) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have garnered attention as supercapacitor materials [17]. Ultrathin TMO and LDH nanosheets possess high specific surface areas and lattice framework chemical activity, enabling high specific capacitance [17]. Common TMOs include $M n O _ { 2 }$ ​ , $C o _ { 3 } O _ { 4 }$ ​ , and multi‐metal oxides like $M n M o O _ { 4 }$ ​ , $Z n C o _ { 2 } O _ { 4 }$ ​ , and $N i C o _ { 2 } O _ { 4 }$ ​ , offering advantages such as low cost and high theoretical capacity [17]. Multi‐metal oxides can provide higher energy density compared to single metal oxides [17]. LDHs, with adjustable metal cations and interlayer anions, exhibit diversity, including single metal ( $N i ( O H ) _ { 2 }$ ​ , $C o ( O H ) _ { 2 }$ ) and multi‐metal (NiCo-LDH, CoAl-LDH) compositions [17]. Despite their potential for high capacitance, TMOs and LDHs often suffer from limitations like poor conductivity, suboptimal cycling performance, and preparation difficulties, necessitating their combination with more conductive materials to enhance performance [17].​  

Beyond traditional metal oxides, novel 2D Bismuth-based materials are emerging, notably Bi2O2Se [7]. This ternary material is highlighted for its significant potential in next-generation electronics due to a unique combination of properties: ultrahigh carrier mobility, a moderate band gap, and remarkable stability [7]. It also possesses excellent mechanical properties, strong spin-orbit coupling, dimerized selenium vacancies, and ferroelectricity [7]. The unique structure of Bi2O2Se facilitates its synthesis through methods like Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD), and Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) [7]. Furthermore, its interaction with oxygen plasma or oxygen at elevated temperatures allows the formation of a high- $\cdot \kappa$ native oxide, Bi2SeO5, creating an atomically sharp interface [7]. This structural characteristic is particularly advantageous for applications requiring high-quality gate dielectrics, underscoring how the intrinsic structure influences its properties and suitability for advanced electronic applications [7]. The combination of high mobility, suitable band gap, and stability positions Bi2O2Se as a promising candidate for high-performance electronic devices.​  

# 2.5 Metal Nanowires  

Conductive metal nanowires, particularly silver nanowires (AgNWs), have emerged as a promising, cost-effective alternative to traditional materials like indium tin oxide (ITO) for transparent conductive coatings and electrodes in electronic devices [10]. Their synthesis can be achieved through various methods, including wet chemical routes, offering versatility and scalability [12].​  

A critical aspect determining the performance of AgNW-based transparent conductive electrodes is the influence of their dimensions and network characteristics on electrical and optical properties [10]. The diameter and length of individual nanowires significantly impact their conductivity and the scattering of light. For instance, studies have explored Ag nanowire networks with diameters ranging from 45 to $1 1 0 \mathsf { n m }$ , and specific applications have utilized nanowires with an average diameter of $3 0 \mathsf { n m }$ and a length of $2 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ [10,22]. Beyond individual nanowire dimensions, the network structure, defined by parameters such as pitch (the average distance between nanowires) or overall network density, plays a crucial role [10]. Investigations into network pitches of 500, 700, and $1 0 0 0 \mathsf { n m }$ have demonstrated how these parameters directly influence the electrical conductivity and optical transparency of the resulting films. Generally, increasing network density enhances electrical conductivity by creating more conductive pathways, but this often comes at the expense of reduced optical transparency due to increased light interaction with the nanowires. Achieving an optimal balance between high conductivity and high transparency is essential for practical applications.​  

Various techniques are employed for assembling these nanowires into conductive networks on substrates. Efforts are underway to develop facile and scalable fabrication methods for Ag nanowire network electrodes, targeting highperformance and foldable applications such as smart windows [42]. The resulting AgNW networks are evaluated for their utility as transparent conducting electrodes in diverse electronic and optoelectronic devices [10]. Beyond standalone AgNW networks, they can also be integrated into composite electrodes, such as combining Ag NWs with materials like MXene. This approach leverages the conductive network formed by Ag NWs to complement the properties of the co-deposited material, enhancing the overall optoelectronic performance of the electrode, as demonstrated in applications like top electrodes for red transparent quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) [22]. This highlights the versatility of metal nanowires not only as primary conductive coatings but also as components in advanced electrode architectures.​  

# 2.6 Conductive Polymers and Other Emerging 2D Materials  

Beyond widely studied 2D materials like graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, several other emerging 2D materials and material classes are garnering interest for their potential as conductive coatings, including borophene, black phosphorus, 2D metal organic frameworks (MOFs), and conductive polymers.  

Borophene, a 2D allotrope of boron, is characterized by unique electronic properties such as high carrier mobility, exceptional conductivity, and a tunable bandgap, positioning it as a promising candidate for applications including gas sensors and flexible electronics due to its flexibility, elasticity, and strength [34]. Recent advancements include the synthesis of a specific micrometre-scale single-crystalline borophene polymorph on $\mathtt { C u } ( 1 0 0 )$ , featuring a unit cell containing ten boron atoms and two hexagonal vacancies [29]. Investigations suggest that the binding to the $\mathtt { C u } ( 1 0 0 )$ surface is primarily through charge transfer rather than covalent interactions [29]. The electronic band structure of this material exhibits multiple anisotropic tilted Dirac cones [29].  

Black phosphorus (BP) is recognized as another significant emerging 2D material, applicable in hybrid systems [19] and characterized as a p-type semiconductor [33] with an adjustable bandgap suitable for photodetectors [44]. In electrochemical energy storage, BP demonstrates potential as a lithium-ion battery (LIB) anode material, offering a high theoretical capacity of $2 5 9 6 \mathsf { m A } \cdot \mathsf { h } / \mathsf { g } \left( L i _ { 3 } P \right.$ formation) [17]. However, a major challenge is the irreversible structural change during lithiation/delithiation cycles [17]. Encapsulation strategies, such as using insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) [17,44], are being explored to mitigate this issue and enable BP application in LIB cathodes [17].  

Two-dimensional metal organic frameworks (2D MOFs) and related covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are also under investigation, particularly for electrochemical applications like supercapacitors and LIBs [17]. These materials possess large $\pi - \pi$ conjugated systems and open, regular channels, which are advantageous for shortening ion diffusion paths and improving charge/discharge rates and capacity in batteries [17]. Other 2D materials like graphdiyne, $C _ { 3 } N _ { 4 }$ , $V O P O _ { 4 }$ ​ , and theoretical candidates such as group Ⅳ single chalcogenide monolayers SiS and SiSe are also being explored for similar applications [17].​  

Conductive polymers represent a class of materials offering advantages like flexibility and potentially lower production costs compared to traditional inorganic conductors. A primary challenge for conductive polymers has been achieving conductivity levels comparable to metals [1]. Recent advances include the synthesis of novel 2D conductive polymer crystals, such as a 2D polyaniline (2DPANI) crystal, prepared via the topological orientation of aniline on water using anionic surfactant monolayers [1]. This approach effectively overcomes previous limitations in polymer conductivity [1]. The resulting 2DPANI crystal exhibits a domain size of $1 3 0 \sim 1 6 0 ~ \mu m ^ { 2 }$ and a thickness ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers [1]. Structurally, it features columnar $\pi$ arrays with an interlayer distance of $3 . 5 9 \mathring { \mathsf { A } }$ and rhombohedral lattices formed by interwoven polyaniline chains [1]. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy and first-principles calculations have confirmed that this ordered structure facilitates strong in-plane conjugation and interlayer electronic coupling, crucial for enhanced conductivity [1]. Conductive polymer hydrogels have also shown utility in applications like solar steam generation and wearable electronics [42].​  

Research into these diverse emerging 2D materials and conductive polymers is often in earlier stages compared to established materials like graphene. Nevertheless, their unique properties and demonstrated potential across various electronic applications underscore their importance for future developments in conductive coatings and related technologies.  

# 3. Synthesis and Deposition Techniques for Conductive 2D Material Coatings  

The synthesis and deposition of conductive two-dimensional (2D) material coatings represent fundamental challenges in realizing their full potential for electronic applications [13,43]. A diverse range of techniques has been developed, broadly classified into top-down approaches, which involve reducing the size of bulk materials, and bottom-up methods, which build materials atom by atom or molecule by molecule [12,30,33]. This section provides an overview of the principal synthesis and deposition strategies employed to fabricate these coatings, which are subsequently elaborated upon in detail in the following sub-sections.  

The main categories encompass gas-phase deposition techniques such as Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD), and Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), typically considered bottom-up growth methods capable of yielding high-quality films [7,33,37].  

Solution-based processing methods, often leveraging materials prepared by top-down exfoliation or wet-chemical synthesis, offer versatile and potentially scalable routes for depositing 2D material inks onto various substrates using techniques like spray coating, dip coating, spin coating, roll-to-roll coating, and inkjet printing [1,9,25,30,39]. Exfoliation techniques, including mechanical and liquid-phase methods, are crucial top-down approaches for obtaining 2D flakes from layered bulk precursors, serving as a primary source for solution-processable materials [12,33,37].  

Furthermore, other advanced fabrication strategies, such as Direct Laser Fabrication (DLF), provide unique capabilities for synthesis, patterning, and modification with high spatial resolution [31]. Each of these techniques involves specific process parameters—such as temperature, pressure, precursor type and concentration, solvent choice, and energy input—that critically influence the morphological, structural, and electronic properties of the resulting 2D material coatings, including film thickness, uniformity, crystallinity, grain size, and defect density [12,20,31,34].  

A comparative analysis of these methods based on critical factors such as scalability for large-area coatings, production cost, control over film quality and uniformity, defect density, and compatibility with different substrates is essential for selecting the most appropriate technique for specific materials and target electronic applications [6,9,10,20,30,31,34,39].  

# 3.1 Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)  

Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) stands as a pivotal technique for the synthesis of conductive two-dimensional (2D) materials, particularly emphasized for its capacity to yield high-quality, large-area films [6,20]. This method is considered highly versatile and commercially viable, enabling the fabrication of continuous films suitable for direct integration into electronic devices, facilitating the achievement of "electronic-grade" material [20]. The fundamental process involves the decomposition of gaseous precursors on a heated substrate or catalyst surface, promoting the formation of the desired 2D material through specific bonding configurations, such as sp2 bonding in the case of graphene [20].​  

Key parameters exert significant influence over the resulting film properties, including growth rate, crystallinity, grain size, and the number of layers [9,12]. The choice of catalyst material is critical; for instance, copper foil is widely utilized as a substrate for growing large-area single-layer graphene films [6,12]. Nickel is another commonly used catalyst [12]. Precursor gases or liquids, such as carbon-containing compounds for graphene [6], VCl3 and tellurium powder for VTe2 [37], or methyltrichlorosilane, boron trichloride, and ammonia for GF/SiBCN composites [27], determine the constituent elements of the deposited film. Reaction temperature, pressure (atmospheric or low pressure), and gas flow rates are also crucial factors influencing the growth process and material quality [12,20]. For example, the surface-mediated growth mechanism on copper, where catalytic activity diminishes after graphene coverage, allows for precise control over film thickness, favoring single-layer growth [6]. Specific examples of CVD processes include the synthesis of L-MWCNTs using a toluene solution of FeCp2 vaporized with argon carrier gas at a controlled temperature [32].  

CVD offers several notable advantages for producing conductive 2D material coatings. It facilitates large-area synthesis, enabling the production of continuous films across substantial substrates [6,41,43]. The method is capable of yielding highquality films characterized by high crystallinity, uniformity, transparency, and electrical conductivity, including large-area single crystal films [24,43]. Furthermore, CVD allows for precise thickness control, rapid growth rates, and high production volumes, making it well-suited for industrial applications and scalability [37]. Significant progress was marked by early reports of large-scale production of highly transparent graphene films via CVD in 2008-2009 [12,41].  

Despite its advantages, CVD presents challenges. The process typically requires high temperatures, which can limit the choice of substrate materials and increase energy costs. While enabling mass production, CVD-grown polycrystalline films often contain seams between single-layer crystals, potentially degrading electrical and mechanical performance [12]. Moreover, transferring the CVD-grown film from the growth substrate (e.g., copper foil) to the target substrate is often necessary, especially when the growth substrate is catalytic or conductive. Common transfer methods using polymer films are prone to causing tearing and leaving undesirable residues, which can significantly impair the properties of the transferred 2D material [12].​  

Recent advancements are addressing some of these limitations and expanding the capabilities of CVD. Demonstrations of graphene growth directly on insulating sapphire substrates via CVD represent a significant step towards simplifying integration into commercial electronics and optoelectronics [6]. Efforts continue to optimize CVD processes for various 2D materials, including MoS2 [31] and VTe2 [37], focusing on achieving the desired electronic-grade quality and enabling largearea, seamless films for advanced electronic applications [20]. Understanding the underlying growth mechanisms remains crucial for precise control over material quality and interface properties [20].  

# 3.2 Solution-Based Methods  

Solution-based processing represents a versatile and cost-effective approach for fabricating conductive coatings using twodimensional (2D) materials, offering advantages such as compatibility with various substrates, potential for large-area manufacturing, and ease of processing [9,41]. This category encompasses a variety of deposition techniques, each with specific process steps and underlying principles, including spray coating, dip coating, spin coating, roll-to-roll coating, and inkjet printing [9,25,30,39].​  

A critical initial step in solution-based processing is the preparation of stable and uniform dispersions or “inks” of 2D materials. Conventional methods for obtaining 2D nanomaterials from bulk precursors include liquid exfoliation and chemical methods, which involve weakening van der Waals forces between layers and inducing delamination [12,37]. Liquidphase exfoliation (LPE) is widely employed, utilizing methods such as ultrasonic exfoliation, alkali metal intercalation, electrochemical intercalation, and molecular-assisted exfoliation in organic solvents like isopropanol (IPA) or N-methyl 2- pyrrolidone (NMP), often with the aid of stabilizers like sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) [21,32,33,37]. While effective for producing materials like graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) and graphene oxide (GO), conventional solution processing can yield materials with small lateral dimensions and significant thickness polydispersity, hindering the formation of effective electronically active percolated networks [12,39]. Strategies to mitigate these limitations include techniques like isopycnic density gradient ultracentrifugation to narrow thickness distribution or using alkali-metal intercalations to increase exfoliation yield [39]. Molecular intercalation-based electrochemical exfoliation is highlighted as an emerging approach yielding 2D nanomaterials with morphologies more suitable for forming electronically active ultra-thin-film networks over large areas, enabling gate-tunable electronics [39].​  

Once stable dispersions are prepared, various deposition techniques are employed. Spin coating is a common laboratory technique involving applying a solution to a substrate and rapidly rotating it to achieve a thin, relatively uniform film [9]. The resulting film thickness and uniformity are significantly influenced by parameters such as spin speed, acceleration, solution concentration, and the number of coating cycles. For instance, spin-coating MXene films at varying concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and $2 . 0 \ : \mathrm { m g / m L }$ ) affects film properties, and repeating spin-coating and annealing steps increases oxide thickness in SnO2 films [22,26]. Spray coating offers rapid, large-area coverage, particularly useful for conductive and corrosion-protective coatings, with enhanced versions using techniques like Laval nozzles and supersonic airflow for improved adhesion and control over film thickness and quality [9]. Parameters like substrate temperature, nozzle distance, carrier gas, and deposition cycles are critical, as demonstrated by the spray pyrolysis of borophene suspension on a hot plate at $1 2 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ with specific cycle times and pauses for solvent removal [34]. Dip coating involves immersing and slowly withdrawing the substrate from the solution to form a film [9]. For flexible substrates like textiles, methods like the pad-dry process, adapted from the textile industry, enable continuous, large-scale coating at speeds of approximately $1 5 0 \mathsf { m }$ /min by passing the fabric through a dispersion bath and using mangle rollers for uniformity before drying [25]. Other techniques include Mayer bar deposition for achieving uniform layers of materials like Ag NWs on underlying films [22] and vacuum filtration, used for preparing homogeneous GO films on membranes before transfer [21].  

The influence of deposition parameters extends beyond the technique itself, impacting film characteristics such as thickness, uniformity, morphology, packing density, coverage, and defect density. Achieving uniform coating across large areas from solution is feasible [41]. Inkjet printing stands out for its potential in patterned deposition, offering advantages in speed and ease of thickness variation compared to methods like Langmuir-Blodgett deposition, making it suitable for direct device fabrication from nanosheet solutions [30]. This technique has been demonstrated for creating patterned structures, such as perovskite microcavity arrays [42].  

Despite the significant advantages of solution-based methods, including their scalability, low cost, and versatility, they face limitations, particularly in achieving the high crystallinity and precise thickness control characteristic of vapor-phase techniques like chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Overcoming structural limitations related to the morphology and dispersibility of the nanomaterials is crucial for realizing their full electronic potential in thin-film applications [39]. Nonetheless, ongoing advancements in dispersion preparation and deposition techniques continue to enhance the performance and applicability of solution-processed 2D material coatings in electronics.  

# 3.3 Exfoliation Techniques  

The production of high-quality two-dimensional (2D) materials typically begins with exfoliation from bulk, layered precursors, where strong in-plane covalent or ionic bonds contrast with weaker van der Waals forces between layers [30]. Since the successful exfoliation of graphene from graphite in 2004 [24], significant attention has been devoted to developing effective exfoliation techniques for various layered materials, including hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) like $M o S _ { 2 }$ , MXenes, layered metal oxides, and perovskites [30]. The primary methods for obtaining 2D flakes are mechanical exfoliation and liquid-phase exfoliation.​  

Mechanical exfoliation, often referred to as the "scotch tape method," represents one of the earliest and simplest techniques [6,12,20,37]. This method involves using adhesive tape to peel progressively thinner layers from a bulk material, such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite [6]. Researchers can then select monolayers or few-layer flakes [12]. Its principal advantage lies in its simplicity and the potential to yield high-quality flakes with minimal defects [6,31,33]. It is particularly suitable for materials with strong in-plane bonds and weak interlayer forces [37]. This technique has been successfully applied to obtain materials like graphene [12], p-type black phosphorus (BP) [33], and 2D magnetic materials such as $C r I _ { 3 }$ ​ , $C r _ { 2 } G e _ { 2 } T e _ { 6 }$ , $N i P S _ { 3 }$ ​ , and $M n P S _ { 3 }$ ​ [37]. However, mechanical exfoliation suffers from significant drawbacks, including extremely low yield, difficulty in precisely controlling the number of layers, and the inability to control flake shape, size, or position [6,31,33]. Consequently, it is primarily used for laboratory-scale research and is not suitable for large-scale preparation [6,33]. Some modifications, such as Au-assisted exfoliation, have been explored to improve cleavage efficiency and yield larger monolayer samples [33].​  

Liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) offers a pathway toward higher yields and scalability compared to mechanical methods [6,33]. This approach disperses bulk layered materials in suitable solvents and applies mechanical energy, often through sonication or shear mixing, to overcome the interlayer van der Waals forces and separate individual layers [33,34,39]. For instance, sonochemical exfoliation uses ultrasound, often in combination with solvents like 2-propanol (IPA), to exfoliate materials such as bulk boron powder into 2D nanosheets [34]. Subsequent centrifugation is typically employed to separate exfoliated flakes from unexfoliated material [34].​  

A critical aspect of LPE is the role of solvents and stabilizing agents. Solvents help to reduce the surface energy difference between the layered material and the liquid, thereby facilitating exfoliation and preventing re-aggregation of the exfoliated flakes. Surfactants can also be added to further stabilize the dispersion. Additionally, intercalation-based exfoliation, which can be considered a form of LPE, involves the insertion of ions or molecules into the interlayer space of the bulk material, weakening the interlayer interactions before mechanical agitation or chemical reaction drives separation [30,39]. Examples include using alkali-metal intercalations to increase exfoliation yield [39] or using organic quaternary ammonium hydroxides (e.g., tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide, TBAOH) which react with interlayer protons in layered metal oxides, triggering layer separation [30]. Molecular intercalation-based electrochemical exfoliation is highlighted as an emerging solution-based approach offering potentially milder synthesis routes and yielding large quantities of dispersed nanosheets [30,39]. LPE methods can produce significant quantities of 2D nanosheets that can be processed into inks, suitable for various coating and printing techniques [20,33].​  

Despite the higher yields offered by LPE, challenges remain. A significant issue is the difficulty in controlling the flake size and thickness distribution [6,31]. The vigorous nature of some LPE processes, such as extensive sonication, can also introduce structural defects in the exfoliated flakes, potentially degrading their electronic properties.  

Scaling up exfoliation techniques for industrial production presents considerable hurdles [6,34]. While LPE methods like sonication, shear mixing, or electrochemical intercalation hold more promise for large-volume production than mechanical exfoliation [30], achieving consistent quality, precise control over flake dimensions, low defect density, and high yield simultaneously at an industrial scale remains an active area of research [6,31,34]. The trade-offs between flake quality, yield, and process scalability continue to drive the development of new and optimized exfoliation strategies.​  

# 3.4 Other Fabrication Methods  

Beyond chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and solution-based approaches, other deposition techniques are employed for fabricating conductive two-dimensional (2D) material films, particularly when high film quality and precise control are paramount. Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD), including techniques like sputtering and thermal evaporation, and Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) are prominent examples. PVD involves depositing material by physical processes such as bombarding a target with ions (sputtering) or heating a material until it evaporates (thermal evaporation). DC magnetron sputtering has been utilized for depositing $\mathsf { T i } _ { 3 } \mathsf { A l C } _ { 2 }$ thin films from elemental targets (Ti, Al, C) in an ultrahigh vacuum system at elevated temperatures $( 7 8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } )$ on c-axis-oriented sapphire substrates, leading to the formation of a TiC incubation layer followed by $\mathsf { T i } _ { 3 } \mathsf { A l C } _ { 2 }$ growth [28].​  

Thermal evaporation has been used to deposit ${ \sf C } _ { 6 0 }$ onto carbon nanotube films and MoOₓ/Au layers at pressures around $1 0 \boxtimes \boxtimes$ mbar [21,26]. MBE, a specific type of PVD, allows for atomic-scale control over film growth, facilitating the layer-bylayer deposition of high-quality epitaxial films [7]. For instance, MBE has been used for the epitaxial growth of $W S e _ { 2 }$ thin films on insulating $A l _ { 2 } O _ { 3 }$ substrates, involving specific temperature profiles and annealing steps to ensure crystallinity [33].  

While PVD and MBE offer exceptional precision and control over film thickness, composition, and crystallinity, often resulting in high-quality films, they typically involve higher costs and lower throughput compared to large-area techniques like CVD or solution processing, limiting their scalability for mass production [28,33]. Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD), a variant of CVD, also provides precise control and can enable direct growth on substrates, bypassing transfer steps [7,12].  

Direct Laser Fabrication (DLF) represents another versatile approach for processing 2D materials, encompassing synthesis, patterning, modification, and thinning [31]. DLF leverages controlled laser–matter interactions to achieve desired material transformations or structural designs. Techniques include femtosecond direct laser writing (DLW), which can synthesize bilayer graphene by rapidly heating co-sputtered Ni/C films on various insulating substrates using a femtosecond laser (780 nm, 120 fs, 100 MHz) [31]. Femtosecond DLW is also effective for controllable reduction and patterning of graphene oxide (GO) films to create graphene microcircuits [31]. Two-beam laser interference (TBLI) is suitable for fabricating periodic patterns on both planar and non-planar surfaces [31]. DLF offers notable advantages, including 3D processing capabilities, high design flexibility, and precise control over the processed area. Its applications extend to laser thinning and potentially doping of 2D materials, allowing for post-processing modifications with high spatial resolution [31].  

Comparing these methods, PVD and MBE are primarily growth techniques focused on achieving high material quality and often epitaxial relationships with substrates, making them suitable for fundamental research and niche applications requiring high performance where cost and throughput are secondary concerns [28,33]. In contrast, DLF is more focused on post-processing and patterning, offering a maskless and direct method for creating specific device geometries or modifying material properties after initial deposition or synthesis [31]. While CVD and solution-based methods often excel in scalability and lower cost, PVD/MBE provide superior quality control, and DLF offers unique capabilities for direct patterning and modification, each finding specific niches in the development of 2D material-based electronics.  

# 4. Properties and Characterization of Conductive 2D Material Coatings  

The performance of conductive two-dimensional (2D) material coatings in electronic applications is intrinsically governed by their key physical and chemical properties. A comprehensive understanding of these properties is essential for designing and optimizing 2D material-based devices [16,30,41].  

This section provides a general overview of the critical properties of conductive 2D material coatings, encompassing their electrical conductivity, optical properties, mechanical characteristics, thermal behavior, and chemical and environmental stability. It also outlines the standard and advanced techniques employed for their characterization and discusses how various factors influence their performance, highlighting key trade-offs relevant to electronic applications.  

Electrical conductivity and charge transport are paramount for conductive coatings. These properties are dictated by the material's intrinsic electronic structure, layer number, dimensionality, and the presence of defects or dopants [1,7,12,30,31,34]. Anisotropic charge transport is frequently observed [1,29]. Modulating conductivity can be achieved  

through defect engineering, aliovalent doping, or surface adsorption [30,34]. Interface quality, particularly contact resistance with electrodes, significantly impacts charge injection and device performance [12,15,16]. Standard electrical characterization techniques include the four-probe method, Van der Pauw method, Hall effect measurements, and fieldeffect transistor (FET) transfer characteristics [2,12,21,44].  

Optical properties, particularly transparency, are crucial for applications in transparent and flexible electronics [24]. Many 2D materials, especially in few-layer forms, possess high intrinsic transparency [9,13,41,43]. Transparency is highly dependent on film thickness and material composition, with thicker films generally exhibiting reduced transmittance due to increased absorption and scattering [22,28]. Hybrid structures and multilayer designs are explored to balance conductivity and transparency [22,26]. UV-Vis spectroscopy is a primary technique for characterizing optical transmission and absorption [21,26].​  

Mechanical properties, including strength, flexibility, and stability under strain, are vital for flexible and wearable electronics [9,24]. 2D materials generally exhibit high theoretical strength and flexibility [13,41]. The mechanical performance of coatings is influenced by material type, thickness, and structural characteristics [3,40]. Coatings must maintain both electrical and mechanical integrity under repeated deformation, a capability demonstrated by various 2D material-based films and composites [18,25,26,31].​  

Thermal properties, specifically thermal conductivity and stability, are critical for efficient heat dissipation in highperformance electronic devices [5]. Some 2D materials, notably graphene, possess exceptionally high thermal conductivity [6,13,43]. Thermal transport is sensitive to defects, functionalization, and interfacial thermal resistance [5,12]. Other 2D materials exhibit tunable thermal properties influenced by structure and composition [14]. Thermal stability is also a key factor, varying depending on the material and composite structure [22,32]. Characterization techniques include Raman thermometry, transient thermoreflectance, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) [12,32].​  

Chemical inertness and environmental stability are essential for long-term device reliability and protection [9]. Certain 2D materials offer high chemical stability and act as effective barrier layers against oxidation, corrosion, and moisture [7,9,12,13,18,29,43]. However, defects and environmental exposure can still impact stability, necessitating strategies like encapsulation and composite formation [26,27,34,44]. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is often used to assess surface composition and chemical states related to stability [34].  

Overall, the properties of conductive 2D material coatings are intricately linked to material composition, synthesis method, film thickness, defect density, doping, post-processing treatments (such as laser irradiation [31] or heat treatment [27]), and interface engineering strategies [3,12,14,30,40]. Characterization employs a range of techniques, including structural (e.g., HRTEM, XRD, SEM, STM, TEM [2,21,27,29,34]), spectroscopic (e.g., Raman, XPS [21,27,32,34]), and functional measurements tailored to each property. A significant challenge lies in optimizing trade-offs between competing properties, most notably the balance between achieving high electrical conductivity and maintaining high optical transparency, which often requires careful material selection and sophisticated engineering approaches [26].​  

# 4.1 Electrical Conductivity and Charge Transport  

The electrical conductivity and charge transport properties of conductive two-dimensional (2D) material coatings are fundamental to their performance in electronic applications. Charge transport in these materials is inherently influenced by their atomic structure, layer number, and dimensionality [1,7]. For instance, the crystal structure, surface structure, and electronic band structure of materials like ${ \sf B i } _ { ( 2 ) } { \sf O } _ { ( 2 ) } { \sf S e }$ significantly affect electron transport [7]. Charge movement can exhibit anisotropy, as observed in conductive polymers where in-plane conductivity $( { \sim } 1 6 \mathsf { S } / \mathsf { c m } )$ differs from out-of-plane conductivity $( { \sim } 7 \mathsf { S } / \mathsf { c m } )$ [1]. In some cases, such as in borophene, the electronic band structure can feature anisotropic tilted Dirac cones, suggesting unique directional transport properties [29]. Beyond individual layers, forming interconnected networks, like the 3D networks generated by covalently connecting 2D nanosheets, can enhance electronic connectivity and improve device performance [19].​  

The electrical properties of 2D materials are highly sensitive to doping and defects, which critically influence carrier concentration and mobility [1,12]. Defect engineering and the introduction of aliovalent dopants are effective strategies to modulate conductivity in materials such as metal oxide nanosheets [30]. For example, $\mathsf { M n O } _ { ( 2 ) }$ vacancies in $\mathsf { M n O } _ { ( 2 ) }$ create new electronic states and reduce the band gap, increasing conductivity [30]. Similarly, substituting aliovalent ions like ${ \mathsf { C o } } ^ { \wedge } ( 2 + )$ , ${ \mathsf { F e } } ^ { \wedge } ( 3 + )$ , or Ru in $\overline { { \mathsf { T i O } } } _ { 2 }$ or $\mathsf { M n O } _ { ( 2 ) }$ introduces additional mobile charge carriers and new energy states, thereby increasing conductivity [30]. Defects and bonding can also determine the intrinsic doping type; borophene, for instance, behaves as a p-type semiconductor, with holes as predominant carriers, likely due to defects and bonding with oxygen and carbon [34]. Surface adsorption can further modify carrier concentration; the adsorption of $N { \mathsf { O } } _ { 2 }$ on borophene, an electron-withdrawing gas, increases hole concentration and reduces resistance [34]. Intentional doping methods, such as laser-assisted doping, have demonstrated effectiveness in modifying the characteristics of 2D semiconductor devices, often yielding superior properties compared to conventional techniques [31]. Conversely, defects like grain boundaries and wrinkles in materials such as graphene can scatter charge carriers and impede electron transport, reducing mobility [6,20]. The resistivity of MXene films, for example, increases with longer etching times, presumably due to increased defect formation [28].​  

Accurate measurement of conductivity and charge transport parameters in low-dimensional materials and thin films presents specific challenges. Standard techniques include the four-probe method and the Van der Pauw method for measuring resistivity or sheet resistance [12,44]. The four-probe method is particularly valuable as it eliminates the influence of contact resistance, improving measurement accuracy [44]. The Van der Pauw method is suitable for irregularly shaped samples [44]. The Hall effect measurement provides insights into carrier type, concentration, and mobility [2,12]. Transfer characteristics derived from field-effect transistors (FETs) are also employed to assess gate control, mobility, and switching behavior [12,21]. Indirect methods, such as assessing electromagnetic shielding effectiveness, can also be used to infer conductivity, where improved shielding indicates higher conductivity [27]. Measuring the exceptionally low resistance of some 2D materials like graphene, potentially reaching the nΩ level in laboratory conditions, poses difficulties for conventional testing methods [44]. Sheet resistance is a critical parameter frequently reported for transparent conducting electrodes [10].  

Comparing reported conductivity and mobility values across different 2D materials and coating methods highlights the current state-of-the-art [41]. Graphene is widely recognized for its extremely low resistivity and exceptionally high electron mobility [41]. Room-temperature carrier mobility in graphene can reach approximately $1 5 0 0 0 \mathsf { c m } ^ { 2 } / ( \mathsf { V } \cdot \mathsf { s } )$ , significantly surpassing silicon [13]. Laboratory-grown CVD graphene has demonstrated carrier mobility exceeding $1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 { \mathsf { c m } } ^ { 2 } / \mathsf { V } \cdot \mathsf { s }$ , approaching the values of pristine graphene [6]. Ballistic transport contributes to graphene's extraordinarily high electronic mobility $( > 1 0 0 0 0 0 { \mathsf { c m } } ^ { 2 } \cdot { \mathsf { V } } ^ { \wedge } ( - 1 ) \cdot { \mathsf { s } } ^ { \wedge } ( - 1 ) )$ , enabling device speeds significantly faster than silicon transistors [24]. High carrier mobility, typically exceeding $1 0 , 0 0 0 \mathsf { c m } ^ { 2 } / \mathsf { V } \cdot \mathsf { s } ,$ , is essential for high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices [6]. Other materials also show promising properties; ${ \sf B i } _ { ( 2 ) } { \sf O } _ { ( 2 ) } { \sf S e }$ exhibits ultrahigh carrier mobility [7]. Conductive polymers can achieve Drude-type conductivity with extrapolated DC values around $2 0 0 { \mathsf { S } } / { \mathsf { c m } }$ , exhibiting metallic out-of-plane transport at lower temperatures [1]. Graphene composites have shown high electrical conductivity values over $8 5 0 0 0 \mathsf { S } / \mathsf { m }$ [4]. For transparent conductive coatings, silver nanowire (AgNW) networks report sheet resistances as low as $6 . 5 \Omega / \mathsf { s q }$ [10]. Composites like MXene/Ag NWs demonstrate improved conductivity over pristine MXene, with average sheet resistances around 12.82 to $2 0 . 0 1 \Omega / \mathsf { s q }$ , comparable to commercial ITO electrodes [22]. Solution-processed reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coatings on fabric show sheet resistance decreasing with increasing coating layers (e.g., from $3 6 1 . 8 2 \mathsf { k } \Omega / \mathsf { s q }$ after one pass to $3 6 . 9 4 \mathrm { k } \Omega / \mathsf { s q }$ after five passes), although resistance can increase after washing [25]. A paintable carbon nanotube coating achieved a sheet resistance of $6 0 \Omega / { \sf s q }$ [32]. Metal oxide-based multi-layer electrodes like $\mathsf { M o O x } / \mathsf { A u } / \mathsf { S n O _ { 2 } }$ can reach minimum sheet resistances around $9 \Omega / { \sf s q }$ , with seed layers improving conductivity [26]. Epitaxial $\tilde { \Pi } _ { 3 } \ C _ { 2 }$ MXene films exhibit metallic resistivity values in the range of 0.37 to $0 . 4 5 \mu \Omega \cdot \mathrm { m }$ , which increase linearly with temperature and also with decreasing film thickness [28]. The processing method significantly impacts the resulting conductivity; for example, heat treatment temperature affects the formation of conductive networks in composites [27], and achieving electronically active percolated networks is crucial for solution-processed films [39].​  

A critical challenge impacting the performance of 2D material-based devices is contact resistance at the interface with electrodes [12,15]. Minimizing contact resistance is crucial for efficient charge injection and extraction, directly affecting device characteristics like speed and power consumption. Research efforts are focused on achieving low-resistance metal contacts to 2D semiconductor monolayers, particularly for encapsulated structures [15]. One effective strategy involves utilizing degenerately doped regions of the 2D material itself to form 2D Ohmic contacts with the channel material, eliminating Schottky barriers [16]. The absence of Schottky barriers and reduced contact resistance not only improves electrical transport but also reduces the RC time constant and carrier transit time, which is particularly beneficial for highspeed devices like photodetectors [16].​

# 4.2 Optical Properties and Transparency  

The optical properties of conductive 2D material coatings, particularly their transparency in the visible spectrum, are critical for applications in flexible and transparent electronics [24]. A hallmark of many 2D materials, especially in single or fewlayer forms, is their inherently high transparency, which makes them suitable candidates for transparent conductive electrodes [41,43].​  

Graphene stands out with remarkable transparency. A single layer of graphene is almost completely transparent, exhibiting a low absorption rate of approximately $2 . 3 \%$ across a wide wavelength range [13,41]. This translates to a high light transmittance, reported to be as high as $9 7 \%$ across a broad electromagnetic spectrum for graphene coatings [9]. This intrinsic property allows laser-reduced graphene oxide films, for instance, to be explored as potential replacements for conventional indium tin oxide (ITO) in transparent electrodes for devices like organic photovoltaics (OPVs) [31]. Beyond broadband transparency, engineered graphene-based metamaterials can achieve specialized optical responses, such as ultra-broadband transmission light absorbers (TLA) with over $9 0 \%$ transmission in specific spectral ranges like the nearinfrared (around $1 0 0 0 \mathsf { n m }$ ) [31].  

Other 2D and carbon-based materials also demonstrate significant transparency. For instance, carbon material films, such as semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (sc-SWCNTs), can achieve high transmittance exceeding $8 0 \%$ in the visible light range [21]. Films deposited on substrates like ITO show optical transmission spectra indicating near-complete transparency, with only about a $1 0 \%$ reduction in transmittance compared to the bare substrate. Even when covering a significant portion $( 8 0 \% )$ of the substrate area, the device optical transmittance remains above $8 0 \%$ [21]. MXene materials also exhibit notable transparency, although it is strongly dependent on the material composition and thickness. For example, at an initial thickness of $1 5 \mathsf { n m }$ , ​  

$T i _ { 3 } C _ { 2 } T _ { x }$ ​-IC films  

were found to be significantly more transparent $9 0 \%$ transmittance) than  

$T i _ { 3 } C _ { 2 } T _ { x }$ ​ films ( $7 0 \%$ transmittance), while  

$T i _ { 3 } A l C _ { 2 }$ ​ films  

of the same thickness showed much lower transparency ( $3 0 \%$ transmittance) [28].  

The transparency of 2D material coatings is intrinsically linked to their thickness or the number of layers. As the amount of material increases, light absorption and scattering generally rise, leading to decreased transmittance. This relationship is evident in MXene films, where increasing the concentration during deposition from  

$$
0 . 5 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }
$$  

to  

$$
1 . 0 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }
$$  

esulted in a slight decrease in average visible transmittance from $9 3 . 9 \%$ to $9 2 . 8 \%$ , respectively [22]. A further increase to  

$$
2 . 0 \mathrm { m g } \mathrm { m L } ^ { - 1 }
$$  

led to a substantial drop in average transmittance to $5 5 . 5 \%$ , illustrating the significant impact of film thickness on optical clarity [22].  

To circumvent the limitations imposed by thickness and simultaneously optimize both transparency and conductivity, multilayer structures are frequently employed. Dielectric/metal/dielectric $\left( \mathsf { D } / \mathsf { M } / \mathsf { D } \right)$ stacks are a well-known strategy, where a thin, highly conductive metal layer is sandwiched between dielectric layers. The dielectric layers can serve as seed layers to improve the metal film morphology or act as anti-reflection coatings to enhance optical transmission through interference effects [26]. Optimized electrodes utilizing such principles, possibly involving materials like $\mathsf { M o O } _ { x }$ and $\mathsf { S n O } _ { 2 }$ ​ , have demonstrated transmittance values around $7 2 \%$ at $5 5 0 \mathsf { n m }$ [26]. Similarly, hybrid structures incorporating 2D materials with other conductive nanomaterials, such as MXene/Ag NWs, can achieve high transparency (e.g., $8 4 . 6 \%$ at $6 2 0 { \mathsf { n m } }$ , comparable to commercial ITO) [22]. The optical transmission in such networks can be influenced by phenomena like localized surface plasmons and surface plasmon polaritons [10].​  

Characterization of these optical properties is typically performed using techniques like UV–Vis spectroscopy, which measures the transmittance and absorbance of the films across ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared wavelengths. These measurements are crucial for evaluating performance for specific applications and understanding the relationship between material properties, film structure, and optical response.  

Ultimately, a critical challenge in developing conductive 2D material coatings for transparent electronics lies in the inherent trade-off between achieving high electrical conductivity and maintaining high optical transparency. High conductivity typically requires a greater density of charge carriers, which often necessitates thicker films or denser networks of the conductive material. However, increased thickness or density directly leads to higher light absorption and scattering, thereby reducing transparency. Optimizing this balance through careful control of material synthesis, film deposition, and the design of multilayer or hybrid structures is essential for advancing the field [26].​  

# 4.3 Mechanical Properties and Flexibility  

The exceptional mechanical properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, particularly their high strength and intrinsic flexibility, position them as promising candidates for flexible and wearable electronics [9,24]. Graphene, for instance, boasts remarkable theoretical values, including a Young's modulus of up to 1.0 TPa and an intrinsic tensile strength reaching 130 GPa, enabling it to be stretched significantly—up to $2 0 \%$ of its original length [13]. Its strength is reported to be 200 times greater than steel, while maintaining a considerably lower weight [6]. This mechanical superiority is particularly evident when compared to conventional materials like indium tin oxide (ITO), which suffers from brittleness and susceptibility to damage under mechanical stress [41].​  

Beyond graphene, other 2D materials also exhibit excellent mechanical characteristics. $T i _ { 3 } C _ { 2 }$ ​ MXene nanosheets, for example, show a Young’s modulus of 80–100 GPa perpendicular to the basal plane and a tensile strength of up to 670 MPa for approximately 40-nm-thin nanoflakes [3]. Furthermore, 2D $B i _ { 2 } O _ { 2 } S e$ is noted for its excellent mechanical properties [7], and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as $M o S _ { 2 }$ ​ , $M o S e _ { 2 }$ ​ , $W S _ { 2 }$ , and $W S e _ { 2 }$ ​ monolayers also possess robust mechanical properties [40].  

The mechanical properties of 2D material coatings are influenced by several factors, including material thickness and structural characteristics [3,40]. For $T i _ { 3 } C _ { 2 }$ ​ MXene nanosheets, a strong dependence of tensile strength on nanosheet thickness has been observed [3]. In the case of TMD monolayers, the mechanical properties—such as stiffness—correlate with their structural phases, suggesting a route to manipulate their mechanical behavior through structural engineering [40].  

Crucially for flexible electronics, these coatings must maintain their electrical and mechanical integrity under repeated deformation. Graphene and its derivatives demonstrate high flexibility and mechanical stability, allowing coatings to adapt to varying surface roughness and curvature while maintaining the appearance of the substrate [9]. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coatings on cotton fabrics, for instance, significantly enhance the textile's mechanical performance, increasing tensile strength by $2 0 \% - 3 0 \%$ after a single coating pass and by approximately $6 0 \%$ after five passes, alongside improved elongation at maximum load [25]. Graphene also contributes to creating soft, flexible, skin-like textile products that are lightweight and comfortable, making them suitable for applications such as sportswear [18].  

Practical demonstrations of flexibility and durability include graphene oxide (GO) thin films integrated with lens arrays on flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates, which retained their morphology and optical performance after bending tests [31]. Similarly, $\mathsf { D / M / D }$ electrodes incorporating molybdenum oxides ( $. M o O _ { x }$ ​ ) and tin dioxide $; S n O _ { 2 }$ ) on flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates exhibited stable sheet resistance even after repeated bending to a tight radius of 1.5 mm—a performance superior to that of commercial PET/ITO electrodes, which typically experience cracking under such stress [26]. These findings underscore the significant potential of 2D material coatings to deliver the required mechanical robustness and flexibility for next-generation flexible and wearable electronic devices.​  

# 4.4 Thermal Properties  

Efficient thermal management is critical for the reliable operation and performance of modern electronic devices. Twodimensional (2D) materials, particularly graphene, have emerged as promising candidates for thermal management applications due to their exceptional thermal properties [5]. Graphene exhibits ultra-high intrinsic thermal conductivity, with reported values for pristine single-layer graphene reaching up to $5 3 0 0 \mathsf { W / m K }$ [13,43], and some studies suggesting values as high as $6 6 0 0 \mathrm { W \cdot m K ^ { - 1 } }$ [43]. This significantly surpasses the thermal conductivity of conventional thermal materials such as bulk graphite $( 2 0 0 0 \boldsymbol { \mathsf { W / m \cdot K } } )$ , carbon nanotubes $( 3 0 0 0 { - } 3 5 0 0 \mathsf { W / m } \cdot \mathsf { K } )$ , diamond, silver $( 4 2 9 \mathrm { W / m } \cdot \mathsf { K } )$ , and copper $( 4 0 1 \mathsf { W / m \cdot K ) }$ [5,6,43]. The inherent high thermal stability of graphene is attributed to the strong aromatic $C = C$ bonds within its basal plane [9].​  

Thermal transport in 2D materials is highly susceptible to various factors, including structural defects, chemical functionalization, isotopical composition, and interfacial thermal resistance with the substrate or surrounding materials [12]. Effective interaction at material interfaces is crucial for enhancing heat dissipation [5]. For instance, vertically aligned functionalized multilayer graphene three-dimensional structures have been explored for thermal interface materials (TIMs), demonstrating ultra-high equivalent thermal conductivity and ultra-low interface thermal resistance [41]. Conversely, the spacing between adjacent layers in multilayer structures can function as a thermal insulating layer, hindering heat conduction [31].​  

Beyond graphene, other 2D materials exhibit distinct thermal properties. First-principles calculations exploring the phononic thermal properties $( k _ { p h } )$ ) of six types of 2D Janus transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers MXY $\mathsf { M } =$ M $\circ , \mathsf { W } ; \mathsf { X } , \mathsf { Y } = \mathsf { S }$ , Se, Te) reveal unique characteristics [14]. The asymmetric structure of Janus TMDs leads to specific thermal transport behaviors. For instance, $k _ { p h }$ in these monolayers exhibits size-dependency, particularly significant up to length scales of $1 0 - 1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ [14]. An atomic mass dependence of $k _ { p h }$ is observed, with Janus TMDC monolayers containing heavier elements like Te generally exhibiting smaller $k _ { p h }$ values [14]. In smaller systems, phonon-boundary scattering plays a substantial role, impacting $k _ { p h }$ and weakening its temperature dependence [14]. Among the studied structures, MSSe monolayers demonstrate the largest $k _ { p h }$ ​ due to their higher phonon heat capacity, group velocity, and lifetime, while competition between these parameters results in similar $k _ { p h }$ ​ values for MSTe and MSeTe monolayers [14]. Compared to graphene's exceptionally high values, other 2D materials like Janus TMDs may possess lower intrinsic thermal conductivity but offer tunability and unique properties valuable for specific applications.  

The high thermal conductivity and small thickness of 2D materials make them ideal for integration into electronic systems to improve heat dissipation [5]. 2D material coatings are widely employed as heat spreaders and thermal interface materials [5]. Graphene oxide (GO), for example, is utilized for its heat dissipation properties in electronic products, with significant industrial production dedicated to this application [12]. Graphene–graphene composites have also shown superior thermal transport properties, with measured thermal conductivities exceeding $2 2 0 \mathsf { W / m } \cdot \mathsf { K }$ [4].  

The thermal stability of 2D material coatings is also a critical performance indicator. While graphene itself exhibits high thermal stability due to its strong bonds [9], the stability of 2D material–based devices or composites can vary. For instance, a MXene/Ag nanowire top electrode in a quantum dot light-emitting diode demonstrated robust thermal stability up to 40 $^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ , with stability diminishing at higher temperatures [22]. Carbon nanotube coatings have shown notable thermal stability, maintaining structural integrity up to $8 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ under argon and approximately $6 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ in air based on thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) [32]. Common techniques for measuring the thermal conductivity and stability of 2D materials and their coatings include Raman thermometry and transient thermoreflectance [12].  

# 4.5 Chemical Inertness and Environmental Stability  

The intrinsic chemical inertness of certain two-dimensional (2D) materials positions them as promising candidates for protective coatings in electronic applications [9]. Graphene, in particular, demonstrates high chemical stability, attributed to its robust crystal lattice structure [13]. This structural integrity translates into impermeability to gases and liquids, allowing graphene coatings to function effectively as barrier layers against environmental degradation such as oxidation, corrosion, and moisture [9,12,18]. Studies have shown graphene's capability to withstand harsh conditions, including high pressure and exposure to superheated water [9]. Its efficacy as an anticorrosion barrier is evidenced by significantly extended protection for steel surfaces immersed in seawater compared to conventional high-performance coatings [43]. Furthermore, graphene-infused fabrics exhibit enhanced resistance to water, chemicals, and UV radiation, contributing to increased durability [18]. Beyond graphene, other 2D materials like Bi2O2Se have been reported to be air-stable [7]. Borophene islands have also shown stability in mild oxygen environments, proving more robust against oxidation than the underlying copper substrate step edges under specific conditions (exposure to $1 \times { 1 0 } ^ { - 6 }$ Torr oxygen for 1 hour) [29].​  

Despite the inherent stability of certain 2D materials, their long-term performance as coatings can be affected by various factors, including defects, surface functionalization, and environmental influences like oxygen and moisture. While some reports indicate that humidity has negligible effects on the electrical properties, such as impedance and resistance, of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coated textiles [25], other sources highlight that graphene is susceptible to oxidation, which can detrimentally impact its electrical characteristics [44]. This underscores the need for rigorous humidity and oxidation resistance testing for graphene-based electronic components [44]. For borophene nanolayers, XPS analysis revealed the presence of carbon and oxygen on the surface, suggesting contamination from exfoliation impurities and air exposure as potential factors affecting stability [34]. While these borophene nanolayers demonstrated greater stability and reduced oxidation compared to other boron-based nanomaterials, oxidation remains a challenge requiring further investigation [34].  

To enhance the stability and reliability of 2D material coatings for practical electronic applications, various encapsulation and surface treatment strategies are employed. Composite structures, for instance, can leverage the stability of other materials to protect the 2D layer. An example includes the use of SiBCN, known for its superior thermal stability and oxidation resistance, to shield graphene foam from oxidation at high temperatures [27]. Furthermore, the inclusion of seed layers has been shown to improve the stability of electrodes based on other materials like MoOx/SnO2, reducing degradation after storage in humid air [26]. These strategies demonstrate the potential to mitigate the inherent vulnerabilities of 2D materials to environmental factors, improving their robustness for long-term applications.  

# 5. Interface Engineering of Conductive 2D Materials  

Interface engineering plays a critical role in optimizing the performance of conductive 2D material coatings for electronic devices [20,38]. Effective control over the interfaces between 2D materials, substrates, and other functional layers is paramount for tailoring electronic properties, ensuring stability, and achieving desired device functionalities [10]. This section summarizes key strategies employed in interface engineering, including surface modification and passivation, various doping methods, and the formation of heterostructures, and discusses their impact on device performance.​  

Surface modification and passivation are fundamental approaches to tune the surface chemistry and electronic properties of conductive 2D material coatings [19]. Techniques such as covalent and non-covalent functionalization, along with methods like atomic layer deposition (ALD), are utilized to modify properties including work function, doping level, and environmental stability [12]. Examples include the functionalization of graphene for enhanced biological activity [13] or thermal transport [5], and the functionalization of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to improve dispersibility and stability in solution, facilitating its use in applications like wearable electronics [25]. Passivation layers, often deposited by ALD [12], are essential for protecting sensitive 2D materials and improving device reliability. Interface interactions, such as charge transfer-induced binding between borophene and Cu [29] or the influence of 2D materials on the crystallization of surrounding matrices [27], highlight the complex interplay at these interfaces.​  

Doping strategies are vital for controlling the carrier concentration and conductivity of conductive 2D materials, enabling the tuning of their electrical type (p- or n-type) [12]. Common methods include chemical doping via molecular adsorbates or charge transfer complexes [13], electrostatic gating, and substitutional doping. Specific examples include the use of C60 as a p-type dopant for single-walled carbon nanotubes (sc-SWCNTs) [21] and laser-assisted doping to achieve n-type $M O S _ { 2 }$ and ptype $\mathsf { W S e } _ { 2 }$ [31]. Achieving degenerately doped regions is crucial for forming low-resistance Ohmic contacts, significantly improving the performance of devices like WSe₂ phototransistors [16]. However, challenges such as achieving stable and uniform doping, particularly under ambient conditions, and the trade-off between carrier concentration and mobility, remain significant areas of research [12].  

The formation of heterostructures by combining different 2D materials into vertical stacks or lateral junctions offers a powerful route to engineer novel electronic properties and tailor device functionalities not present in individual layers [12,38,45]. The energy band alignment and charge transfer at the interfaces govern the behavior of these van der Waals heterostructures [12]. Diverse fabrication methods, including sequential growth and transfer, CVD, and solution-based approaches like Langmuir–Blodgett assembly or sequential stacking of nanosheets, are employed to create well-defined heterostructures [12,20,30]. Lateral heterostructures and interfaces involving different phases or crystal structures within the same material system also enable property tuning [2,38]. Interface engineering via heterostructure formation has led to improved device performance, such as enhanced charge separation in all-carbon photodetectors based on scSWCNT/GO/C60 heterojunctions [21], optimization of contacts using interface layers like MXene [22], the use of native oxides as gate dielectrics [7], and the investigation of low-resistance metal contacts to encapsulated semiconductor monolayers [15]. Seed layers are also utilized to control the growth and interface properties of subsequent films [2,26]. By precisely controlling the interfaces through these strategies, it is possible to realize advanced electronic devices with improved performance and novel functionalities [38].​  

# 5.1 Surface Modification and Passivation  

Surface modification plays a crucial role in tailoring the properties of conductive 2D material coatings for electronic applications, enabling the creation of multifunctional and multiresponsive hybrid systems [19]. This approach involves controlled interfacing of 2D materials with molecules or assemblies, which can be implemented symmetrically or asymmetrically across the material's surfaces [19]. Various techniques, including covalent functionalization, non-covalent functionalization, atomic layer deposition (ALD), and other surface treatments, are employed to modify the surface chemistry, electronic properties such as work function and doping level, and environmental stability of these coatings [12].  

Chemical functionalization is a primary method to engineer the surface properties. For instance, the surface of graphene can be modified by introducing active functional groups like carboxyl ions, which significantly improves its cell and biological reaction activity, making it suitable for biological interfaces and applications like bacterial detection and diagnostic devices due to its modifiable chemical functions and large contact area [13,41]. Another example involves functionalizing graphene with amino silane molecules to enhance specific interactions, such as thermal transport between graphene and a substrate [5]. Similarly, the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) can be functionalized using polymers like poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) for specific applications [25]. These modifications demonstrate the ability of surface functionalization to impart new properties and tune chemical reactivity for diverse applications.​  

Beyond property tuning, surface modification also encompasses the application of passivation layers. Passivation is essential for protecting sensitive 2D materials from degradation caused by environmental factors, thereby improving the reliability and longevity of electronic devices utilizing these materials [12]. Techniques like ALD are utilized for depositing such passivation or nucleation layers [12]. While the provided digests highlight various surface modification techniques and their impact on properties like chemical reactivity and, by implication, electronic function and stability, they illustrate the broad utility of these approaches in tailoring 2D material coatings for specific performance requirements. The specific advantages and disadvantages of each technique depend heavily on the target 2D material, the desired property modification, and the intended application environment, necessitating careful selection based on the desired outcome.  

# 5.2 Doping Strategies  

Tuning the electrical properties of conductive 2D material coatings, such as carrier concentration, conductivity, and electronic type (p-type or n-type), is crucial for optimizing their performance in electronic applications. Doping strategies provide effective means to achieve this control [12]. A variety of doping methods have been explored, including chemical doping via adsorbates or charge transfer complexes, electrostatic gating, and substitutional doping [12].​  

Chemical doping through molecular adsorption offers a flexible approach. For instance, the adsorption of various gas molecules on graphene can significantly alter its electronic structure, impacting carrier concentration and enabling tuning towards different doping types [13]. Similarly, C60 has been demonstrated as a p-type dopant for single-walled carbon nanotubes (sc-SWCNTs), inducing electron transfer from the valence band of sc-SWCNT to C60, as evidenced by Raman spectroscopy [21]. Laser-assisted techniques also offer a pathway for doping, potentially facilitating simultaneous doping during processes like the reduction of graphite oxide (GO) to reduced graphene oxide (RGO) by utilizing defect sites in GO in a controlled dopant precursor gas environment [31]. This method has been applied to achieve phosphorus doping in ultrathin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), successfully yielding n-type MoS2 and p-type WSe2 using a continuous wave 532 nm laser [31]. Heavily doped regions are also critical for device performance, such as the use of degenerately pdoped WSe2 to form low-resistance Ohmic contacts [16].​  

Despite the effectiveness of doping in enhancing conductivity and tailoring electronic type, several challenges persist. Achieving stable and uniform doping across large areas of 2D material coatings remains a significant hurdle [12]. Environmental factors, particularly exposure to air, can compromise the stability of doped states, especially for doping based on adsorbate interactions. Furthermore, increasing carrier concentration through doping often introduces scattering centers, leading to a trade-off with carrier mobility [12]. Optimizing doping processes requires balancing the desired increase in conductivity with the need to maintain sufficiently high carrier mobility for efficient charge transport.  

# 5.3 Heterostructure Formation  

Combining different two-dimensional (2D) materials into vertical or lateral heterostructures represents a pivotal approach to engineer novel electronic functionalities and properties that are not attainable in individual layers [12,38]. This strategy leverages the unique characteristics of various 2D materials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), hBN, metal oxide nanosheets, and carbon nanotubes, to create synergistic effects at their interfaces. A fundamental aspect governing the behavior of van der Waals heterostructures is the interplay of energy band alignment and charge transfer at the interfaces [12]. Precise control over these phenomena enables the tuning of electronic and optoelectronic properties.  

For instance, in a heterojunction formed by depositing semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (sc-SWCNTs) on a graphene oxide (GO) surface, followed by vacuum thermal evaporation of C60, the specific energy band alignment between sc-SWCNTs and C60 facilitates efficient transfer of photo-generated electrons from the sc-SWCNTs to C60. This charge separation mechanism is critical for enhancing exciton dissociation and significantly improves the optoelectronic performance, leading to high-performance transparent all-carbon photodetectors [21].  

The synthesis of well-defined 2D material heterostructures is crucial for realizing their potential. Various methods have been developed for creating both vertical (stacked) and lateral heterostructures. For van der Waals stacks, common approaches include sequential growth and transfer methods, enabling the construction of structures like graphene/TMDs or TMD/TMD stacks [12]. Direct chemical vapor deposition (CVD) offers a route for out-of-plane heterostructures, such as alternating graphene and h-BN layers, although the growth mechanisms for compound 2D materials like h-BN present challenges in controlling multiple elements simultaneously [20]. Solution-based methods are also employed, such as the LangmuirBlodgett (LB) layer-by-layer (LbL) process, which can create multilayer films and heterostructures of metal oxide nanosheets, mitigating issues like overlapping areas and uncovered gaps encountered in monolayer deposition [30]. Sequential stacking of oppositely charged nanosheets provides an alternative solution route, though its applicability is currently limited by the restricted availability of suitable cationic nanosheet compositions [30]. Post-deposition treatments like UV irradiation can be used, for example, to decompose residual ions on nanosheet surfaces after LB deposition [30]. The fabrication of the sc-SWCNT/GO/C60 heterojunction involves spin coating for the initial layers, followed by vacuum thermal evaporation for the C60 film [21]. Lateral heterostructures, where different 2D materials or phases meet side-by-side within the same plane, can be formed through techniques that allow for the growth of distinct materials or phases adjacent to each other. Examples include TMD alloys or structures like Bi2Te3/CrTe2 heterostructures, where plan-view crystal structures can exhibit Moiré superlattices indicative of specific interface orientations [2,12]. Furthermore, polymorphic 2D materials can be utilized to create homo- and heterophase interfaces within the same material system [38].​  

The ability to design and synthesize diverse 2D heterostructures opens up significant potential for advanced electronic devices. By carefully selecting and stacking materials or creating lateral junctions, properties such as band alignment, charge transfer characteristics, and even mechanical properties can be tuned for specific applications [12,40]. These engineered interfaces are fundamental components for devices such as memristors, resonant tunneling transistors, and electrochemical cells [38]. The successful creation of all-carbon photodetectors based on sc-SWCNT/GO/C60 heterojunctions underscores their utility in optoelectronics [21]. Moreover, the investigation of artificial ferroelectric van der Waals heterostructures highlights their promise for novel electronic functionalities, potentially enabling new classes of devices [15]. Overall, the formation of 2D material heterostructures provides a powerful platform for engineering materials with tailored electronic properties for next-generation electronics.​  

# 6. Applications of Conductive 2D Material Coatings in Electronics  

The exceptional and diverse properties of conductive two-dimensional (2D) materials, including their high electrical conductivity, mechanical flexibility, large surface area, unique optical characteristics, and thermal performance, position them as transformative candidates for a wide array of electronic applications. These materials offer compelling advantages over traditional bulk materials, enabling device miniaturization, enhanced performance, and novel functionalities in nextgeneration electronics [6,7,8,12,13,17,31,38,41,43].

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the applications of conductive 2D material coatings, categorized by device type or function. The subsequent sub-sections will delve into their utilization in Transparent Conductive Electrodes (TCEs), Flexible and Wearable Electronics, Sensors, Energy Storage Devices, Transistors and Interconnects, Optoelectronics (covering Photodetectors, Solar Cells, and LEDs), and Thermal Management and Electromagnetic Shielding [8,15,21,22,26,30,41,43].  

For each application area, we will explore the typical device structure, elucidate the specific role of the conductive 2D material coating in enhancing performance or enabling new capabilities, and analyze relevant performance metrics. A quantitative comparison with traditional materials, such as indium tin oxide (ITO), silicon, or metals, will be presented where applicable to highlight the advantages offered by 2D material coatings [8,21,22,26,43].  

Furthermore, the specific benefits provided by employing 2D materials in each context will be discussed, alongside the critical challenges that must be addressed to facilitate their widespread adoption across the electronics industry.  

# 6.1 Transparent Conductive Electrodes (TCEs)  

Transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) are critical components in a wide array of optoelectronic devices, including displays, touch screens, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes [10,12,26,41]. Traditionally, indium tin oxide (ITO) has been the dominant material for TCEs due to its favorable combination of high electrical conductivity and optical transparency [21]. However, the brittleness, increasing cost, and limited abundance of indium have driven extensive research into alternative materials, with conductive 2D materials and related nanostructures emerging as promising candidates [12,13,43]. These materials, such as graphene, MXenes, and metal nanowire networks, offer unique optical and electrical properties suitable for transparent electrode applications [24].​  

Graphene, with its excellent electrical conductivity, high transparency, and inherent flexibility, has been widely explored as a potential replacement for ITO in applications like touch screens, liquid crystal displays, organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) [12,41]. Studies have shown that graphene can outperform ITO in terms of mechanical strength, flexibility, and light transmission [43]. For instance, laser-reduced graphene oxide films have been demonstrated as transparent electrodes in flexible, bulk heterojunction OPVs, offering a potential alternative to ITO [31]. Furthermore, transparent graphene/PEDOT-PSS composite films have been utilized as counter electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells [8]. While promising, challenges remain in achieving comparable electrical performance and long-term stability to established ITO technology [12]. In terms of photovoltaic device efficiency, CVD-grown graphene films as anodes achieved energy conversion efficiencies of up to $1 . 7 1 \%$ , which represented about $5 5 . 2 \%$ of the efficiency observed with ITO-based devices in one study [43].​  

Beyond graphene, other 2D materials and related nanostructures have been investigated. MXenes, such as $\tilde { \Pi } _ { 3 } \ C _ { 2 }$ , also exhibit potential as TCEs. Compared to graphene TCEs, MXene films can offer slightly higher transmittance values, although their resistivity tends to be approximately two orders of magnitude higher [28]. Metal nanowire networks, particularly silver nanowires $( \mathsf { A g N W S } )$ , have demonstrated significant potential. Research comparing Ag NW networks to a standard $8 0 \mathsf { n m }$ thick sputtered ITO layer has shown that dilute Ag NW networks can achieve lower sheet resistance alongside higher optical transmittance than ITO, providing key design guidelines for high-performance nanowire electrodes in devices like thin-film solar cells [10,42].​  

To leverage the strengths of different materials, composite structures are also being explored. A composite electrode utilizing MXene and Ag NWs has been successfully employed as a transparent conductive electrode in T-QLEDs [22]. This composite material demonstrated promising performance metrics, achieving a low square resistance of $1 6 . 0 7 ~ \Omega ~ \mathrm { s q } ^ { - 1 }$ and a high transmittance of $8 4 . 6 \%$ at $6 2 0 \mathsf { n m }$ [22].  

Novel electrode architectures, such as dielectric/metal/dielectric (D/M/D) multilayer structures, represent another approach to optimizing the performance trade-off between conductivity and transparency [26]. These multilayer films utilize a thin metal layer sandwiched between two dielectric layers to enhance conductivity while maintaining high transparency through optical interference effects. $\mathsf { D / M / D }$ electrodes have been investigated as bottom transparent electrodes in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), demonstrating their feasibility as alternatives to ITO [26]. Evaluation of such electrodes focuses on critical performance metrics including sheet resistance, optical transparency, and the resulting power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cell devices [26].​  

In summary, while ITO remains the benchmark for TCEs, 2D materials and related nanostructures offer distinct advantages, particularly in flexibility and potentially lower processing costs [12,43]. Materials like graphene and Ag NWs have shown performance metrics that, in some cases, surpass ITO [10,43], while others like MXenes present different trade-offs [28]. Novel approaches such as composite electrodes and $\mathsf { D / M / D }$ structures aim to overcome limitations and further optimize performance [22,26]. Despite significant progress, achieving consistently high electrical conductivity, optical transparency, and long-term stability comparable to ITO across various device platforms remains a key challenge for these emerging TCE technologies.​  

# 6.2 Flexible and Wearable Electronics  

The advent of flexible and wearable electronics necessitates materials capable of maintaining electrical performance under significant mechanical deformation. Conductive two-dimensional (2D) material coatings have emerged as transformative elements in this domain, owing to their intrinsic flexibility, exceptional mechanical strength, and superior electrical properties [13,18,19,25,32]. Materials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and MXenes like ${ T i _ { 3 } C _ { 2 } }$ ​ nanosheets demonstrate suitability for flexible electronic applications [32]. Graphene, specifically, exhibits excellent ductility and conductivity, enabling the creation of highly flexible products, including foldable displays, whose flexibility surpasses conventional materials [13]. Similarly, other 2D films are recognized as "ultra-strength materials" possessing high mechanical elasticity, capable of withstanding strains exceeding $1 2 5 \%$ , coupled with a high Young's modulus, making them ideal for high-performance flexible devices [24].  

The integration of conductive 2D material coatings facilitates the fabrication of a diverse range of flexible and wearable electronic devices. Specific examples include flexible displays [13], bendable smartphones, and health patches utilizing graphene coatings to enhance circuits [9]. Wearable sensors are a prominent application area, with developments including flexible piezoresistive pressure sensors for digital healthcare, human-machine interfaces, and robotics [19]. Furthermore, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coated fabrics have been integrated into wearable sensors for activity monitoring [25]. Textilebased electronics represent a significant subset, where graphene-infused textiles provide real-time monitoring of physiological signals, facilitate temperature regulation, and enhance comfort during physical activities [18]. Paintable CNT coatings have been successfully integrated into conventional T-shirts made from polyester or polyamide-polyester blends, enabling continuous physiological data capture such as electrocardiogram (ECG) recording during various activities, including sitting, sleeping, walking, and running [32]. Beyond basic sensing, graphene-enabled smart textiles play a crucial role in advanced healthcare applications like remote patient monitoring, wound healing, and wearable therapy devices [18]. The exceptional mechanical strength and impermeability of graphene also lend themselves to developing protective clothing, such as bulletproof vests and chemical-resistant garments [18]. Research also explores conductive hydrogels, such as highly adhesive and self-healing γ-PGA/PEDOT:PSS compositions, enabled by multiple hydrogen bonding, for wearable electronics, alongside large-area, untethered, stretchable multiplexing self-powered triboelectric skins [42]. For implantable applications, such as neurological disorder diagnosis and treatment, graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) are being developed for their sensitivity in detecting individual neuron discharges within the brain [12].  

Despite the significant progress, several critical challenges must be addressed for the widespread adoption of conductive 2D material coatings in flexible and wearable electronics. These challenges include maintaining stable electrical performance under repeated mechanical strain, ensuring the long-term mechanical durability of the coatings and devices through numerous bending, stretching, or washing cycles, and considering the biocompatibility of the materials, particularly for wearable or implantable applications where direct contact with the human body occurs [12,25]. Research into robust integration methods onto various flexible substrates, such as polymers and textiles, and developing coatings that can withstand harsh conditions without significant degradation in performance remains essential.​  

# 6.3 Sensors  

Conductive two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as highly promising candidates for sensing applications, primarily attributed to their exceptional properties, including high surface area, unique electronic characteristics, and tunable surface chemistry [13,19,34,41]. These attributes enable 2D materials to serve as highly sensitive sensing layers, facilitating the development of advanced sensors across various domains such as environmental monitoring, healthcare, and industrial safety [12,17,24].  

The sensing mechanisms employed by 2D material-based sensors are diverse and depend on the specific material and target analyte. A prevalent mechanism involves the change in material conductivity upon interaction with the analyte, often referred to as resistive sensing [12,41]. For instance, graphene's unique 2D structure and large surface area make it highly sensitive to its surrounding environment, allowing for the detection of even single gas molecule adsorption or release [41,43]. When a gas molecule is adsorbed onto the graphene surface, it induces a local change in resistance. Graphene's inherently high conductivity and low noise enable the detection of these minute resistance variations, forming the basis of highly sensitive gas detectors [41]. Other mechanisms include work function shifts [12] and electron transfer processes, which are fundamental to electrochemical sensing [17]. In electrochemical sensors, 2D nanomaterials are utilized as electrode materials due to their high conductivity and abundance of active sites, both crucial for achieving high sensitivity [17]. Beyond electronic transduction, physical interactions like strain can also be effectively transduced by 2D materials; for example, the resistance of a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coated fabric changes predictably with bending and compression, demonstrating its utility as a strain sensor for monitoring human activities [25].​  

The application landscape of conductive 2D material sensors is broad, encompassing the detection of gases, chemical species, biomolecules, and physical parameters [12]. For gas sensing, materials like graphene exhibit sensitivity potentially comparable to single-molecule detection limits due to their high surface adsorption capacity [13,41]. Borophene has also demonstrated exceptional gas sensing capabilities, particularly for NO_{2} detection at room temperature and in humid environments [34]. Quantitative analysis of borophene's performance yields remarkable limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), calculated using the formulas:​  

$$
\begin{array} { c c c } { L O D = \frac { 3 S _ { y } } { b } } \\ { L O Q = \frac { 1 0 S _ { y } } { b } } \end{array}
$$  

where S_y represents the standard deviation of the y-residuals and b is the sensitivity from calibration curves [34]. For ${ \mathsf { N O } } _ { - } \{ 2 \}$ in humid conditions, a borophene sensor achieved LOD and LOQ values of 23 ppb and 76 ppb, respectively, well below European Air Quality Standards' threshold limit values. Furthermore, this sensor demonstrated good selectivity for NO_{2} with minimal interference from common gases like CO_{2} and benzene [34].  

In chemical and biosensing, graphene sensors are widely explored for detecting substances such as dopamine and glucose, showing good sensitivity and stability [13]. The integration of gold nanoparticles with graphene has also been investigated for biosensor applications [8]. For implantable biosensors and smart patches used in health monitoring, graphene-coated gold surfaces offer advantages due to their resistance to sweat corrosion, enhancing device longevity and reliability [9]. Constructing 3D networks from 2D nanosheets can lead to chemical sensors with enhanced performance [19]. Electrochemical sensors leveraging 2D nanomaterials are particularly relevant in biology, food, environment, and medicine, offering simple operation, low cost, high selectivity, and high sensitivity [17].​  

Beyond chemical and biological targets, 2D materials are applied in physical sensors. Strain sensors based on rGO coatings exhibit repeatable resistive responses to mechanical deformation [25]. Pressure sensors utilizing 2D materials are being developed, including those with sensitivities suitable for low-to-medium pressure ranges, pertinent to medical diagnosis and health monitoring applications [19]. Graphene-based magnetic sensors are even being tested by automotive manufacturers for monitoring electric vehicle battery health, demonstrating the ability to precisely detect small magnetic fields [12].​  

Compared to traditional sensing technologies, conductive 2D materials often offer advantages such as higher sensitivity due to their large surface-to-volume ratio and electronic properties [17,41], faster response times, and the potential for miniaturization and integration into flexible or wearable formats [25]. Their ability to operate at room temperature, especially highlighted by borophene for NO_{2} detection, can reduce energy consumption and device complexity compared to metal oxide semiconductor gas sensors requiring elevated temperatures [34]. However, challenges remain in terms of long-term stability, reproducibility in mass production, and achieving highly specific selectivity for complex analyte mixtures without functionalization. Despite these limitations, the ongoing research and development in conductive 2D material coatings continue to push the boundaries of sensing technology.  

# 6.4 Energy Storage Devices  

Conductive two-dimensional (2D) materials represent a promising class of materials for enhancing the performance of energy storage devices, including batteries and supercapacitors [13,17,41,43]. Their application leverages unique properties such as high electrical conductivity, large specific surface area, structural flexibility, and chemical stability, contributing significantly to improved charge transfer kinetics, electrode stability, and active material utilization [13,17,41,43]. The role of 2D material interfaces is particularly emphasized in electrochemical cells, highlighting the importance of interface engineering for performance enhancement [38].  

In supercapacitors, the high conductivity and large surface area of 2D materials like graphene are highly advantageous [41,43]. These properties facilitate rapid electron transport and provide abundant electrochemically accessible sites for charge accumulation, potentially leading to higher energy storage densities compared to conventional capacitor designs [41,43]. The electronic structure and charge transfer kinetics of nanosheets are critical factors in their supercapacitive performance [30]. For instance, the presence of Mn vacancies in the 2D $\delta \mathrm { - } \mathrm { M n O _ { 2 } }$ ​ lattice has been shown to significantly improve the specific capacitance of pseudocapacitors based on this material [30]. Activated graphene, for example, has been shown to achieve an energy density of $7 0 \mathrm { { W h } \cdot \mathrm { { k g } ^ { - 1 } } }$ when used in a capacitor with a TEABF4/AN electrolyte [43].  

For battery applications, particularly lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), conductive 2D materials serve as electrode active materials, current collectors, or conductive additives, aiming to address limitations of conventional materials such as volume expansion, poor conductivity, and structural degradation during cycling. Graphene's structure is particularly advantageous for facilitating efficient lithium-ion insertion and extraction, which can directly improve the energy and power density of lithium batteries [43]. As a negative electrode material, graphene has demonstrated specific capacities up to ${ \mathsf { J } } 4 0 \operatorname { m A h } \cdot { \mathrm { g } } ^ { - 1 }$ [43].​  

Beyond graphene, other 2D materials have garnered significant attention [17]. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as $\phantom { } _ { S n S _ { 2 } }$ ​ , $M o S _ { 2 }$ ​ , $V S _ { 2 }$ , $W S _ { 2 }$ ​ , and $\ T i S _ { 2 }$ ​ possess a graphene-like layered structure amenable to exfoliation, which benefits rapid ${ \mathsf { L } } { \mathsf { i } } ^ { + }$ diffusion [17]. Their loose layered structure can help mitigate structural expansion caused by Li​+ intercalation [17]. However, the intrinsic poor conductivity of many TMDs necessitates their combination with conductive materials to optimize electrochemical performance [17]. Similarly, transition metal oxides (TMOs) like ​MnO , ${ T i O } _ { 2 }$ ​ , $S n O _ { 2 }$ , and $C u O$ offer rich electrochemical reaction sites and short ${ \mathsf { L } } { \mathsf { i } } ^ { + }$ diffusion paths [17]. Nevertheless, the irreversible  

stacking of individual nanosheets reduces active surface area, a challenge that can be addressed by compositing with conductive carbon materials [17]. A critical issue for TMOs in LIBs is the reduction of metal cations to zero-valent metals, leading to morphology changes and structural collapse that severely impact cycle performance [17]. Understanding the oxidation state changes and chemical/mechanical stability is key to optimizing TMO-based electrodes [17].  

MXenes, such as $T i _ { 3 } C _ { 2 }$ ​ and $T i _ { 2 } C$ , exhibit metallic conductivity, narrow diffusion layers, and a low operating voltage $( 0 . 2 { \sim } 0 . 6 \lor \lor \mathsf { s } . \mathsf { L i } / \mathsf { L i } ^ { + }$ ), making them suitable for energy storage devices with good rate performance [3,17]. Like other 2D materials, pure MXenes are prone to stacking, which can cause structural collapse when used as LIB electrodes [17]. Compositing MXenes with other materials, such as forming a free-standing composite membrane of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and $T i _ { 3 } C _ { 2 }$ ​ , has significantly increased the reversible capacity and demonstrated excellent stability and rate performance [17]. Furthermore, modifying the surface of $T i _ { 3 } C _ { 2 }$ ​ with $S n ^ { 4 + }$ has resulted in a higher capacity $( 6 3 5 \mathsf { m A } \cdot \mathsf { h } / \mathsf { g } )$ and improved cycle and rate performance [17]. Despite the promising results, the reported capacity of $T i _ { 3 } C _ { 2 } T _ { x }$ ​ materials is often considerably lower than the theoretical calculated value, indicating substantial potential for further development in LIB research [17].​  

Comparing 2D material-enhanced energy storage devices with alternatives like silicon-based alloys, which are investigated for improving the energy density, power density, cycle life, and rate capability of LIBs [35], 2D materials offer unique advantages. While Si alloys face challenges related to volume expansion during lithiation, 2D materials, particularly through compositing strategies (e.g., graphene/porous silicon composite [17]), can enhance structural integrity and improve electrochemical performance metrics like rate capability and cycle stability [17]. The development of "graphene super batteries" highlights the potential of 2D materials to address critical issues like battery capacity and charging time, particularly relevant for applications such as new energy vehicles [13].​  

Despite the significant progress, a deeper understanding of the mechanism of ${ \mathsf { L } } { \mathsf { i } } ^ { + }$ storage in various 2D nanomaterials is still needed [17]. Theoretical calculations can serve as a valuable tool to guide the synthesis of 2D nanomaterials with optimized performance characteristics [17]. Overall, 2D nanomaterials have demonstrated immense potential as electrode materials for advanced energy storage systems [17].​  

# 6.5 Transistors and Interconnects  

Two-dimensional (2D) materials hold significant potential for revolutionizing next-generation electronic devices, serving roles in transistors and interconnects that can potentially surpass the limitations of traditional silicon-based technologies [43,44]. Their atomic thickness offers distinct advantages for miniaturization and scaling in highly integrated circuits [11].  

In the realm of transistors, 2D materials are explored for their application as both active channel layers and highly conductive contact or gate electrode materials. Semiconducting 2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), are particularly promising for use as the channel material in field-effect transistors (FETs) [11]. For instance, 2D $B i _ { 2 } O _ { 2 } S e$ has been successfully utilized in the fabrication of FETs and logic gates [7]. Ambipolar transistor operation has also been demonstrated in $W S e _ { 2 }$ ​ thin films through electrolyte gating [33]. Conductive 2D materials like graphene are investigated for their suitability in transistor fabrication [13]. A key advantage of using 2D materials as channels is their potential for extremely high operating speeds. Graphene, for example, exhibits extraordinarily high electronic mobility, exceeding $1 0 0 0 0 0 \ c m ^ { 2 } \cdot \mathsf { V } ^ { - 1 } \cdot \mathsf { s } ^ { - 1 }$ due to ballistic transport, indicating performance potentially 100 times faster than silicon transistors [24]. The fastest reported graphene transistor achieved a ​300 GHz cut-off frequency in 2010 [13,24].  

Beyond channel applications, conductive 2D materials are vital for enhancing transistor performance through optimized interfaces and contacts. Achieving low-resistance metal contacts to semiconductor monolayers is a critical factor in improving transistors and interconnects [15]. 2D material interfaces are also explored in specific transistor architectures like resonant tunneling transistors, highlighting the impact of interface design on device performance [38]. Furthermore, the controlled interfacing of 2D materials with molecular switches can enable transistors responsive to multiple stimuli [19]. Covalent connection of 2D nanosheets to form 3D networks can also lead to FETs with enhanced performance [19]. Solutionprocessed 2D materials are also being investigated for gate-tunable thin-film electronics, emphasizing the importance of forming electronically active ultra-thin-film networks for device performance [39].​  

Highly conductive 2D materials, particularly graphene, are highly attractive for use as interconnects in miniaturized circuits. As circuit dimensions shrink, interconnect resistance and electromigration become significant challenges. Graphene's inherent properties make it an excellent candidate for integrated circuit electronic devices [41]. Graphene nanoribbons, in particular, are considered a viable option for integrated circuit interconnection materials, potentially replacing traditional copper metal and addressing related issues [41]. The integration of graphene into silicon chips is actively being pursued to increase data processing speeds [12].  

Hybrid integration approaches, combining 2D materials with existing CMOS technology, represent a promising path for nextgeneration electronics. A notable achievement is the creation of high-density microchips integrating 2D materials with CMOS for memristive applications [11]. In such systems, a 2D material like hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) can function as a memristor, while silicon-based CMOS transistors act as current selectors and limiters [11]. These hybrid devices demonstrate advantages such as low power consumption and high durability, enabling applications like ultra-low power artificial neural networks [11]. The achieved device sizes, such as 260 nanometers, indicate the potential for further miniaturization with advanced manufacturing [11]. Furthermore, graphene can be used as a heat spreader for high-power GaN transistors, transferred onto substrates like SiC to enhance thermal management [5].  

Despite the significant advantages offered by 2D materials in terms of speed, miniaturization, and power efficiency in specific architectures [11,13,24], challenges remain. A primary hurdle is achieving sufficiently low contact resistance between 2D materials and metal electrodes, which is crucial for optimal device performance [15]. Difficulties in manufacturing high-quality single-layer graphene and identifying suitable substrates for large-scale integration also pose challenges [41].  

In summary, 2D materials are poised to either replace or augment traditional silicon and metal components in transistors and interconnects, offering pathways to overcome current technological bottlenecks and enable faster, smaller, and more energy-efficient electronic devices for future computing and AI applications [43,44].  

# 6.6 Optoelectronics (Photodetectors, Solar Cells, LEDs)  

The unique optical and electronic properties of conductive two-dimensional (2D) materials have positioned them as promising candidates for applications in optoelectronic devices. These atomic‐thin materials, coupled with advancements in integration technologies, accelerate the development of on‐chip devices in fields such as sensing, communications, and photodetection [24]. Single‐layer graphene, for instance, demonstrates potential in accelerating optical communication [12], while research also explores its use in advanced camera sensors [41]. The utility of conductive 2D materials in optoelectronics spans various roles, including transparent electrodes, charge extraction/injection layers, and active semiconductor components.​  

In the realm of photodetectors, 2D materials serve as active channel materials, enabling high‐performance devices. An all‐ carbon field-effect transistor (FET) photodetector has been fabricated using single-chirality single-walled carbon nanotube (sc-SWCNT)/fullerene (C60) heterojunctions, demonstrating a broadband spectral response covering the visible–near infrared region from 405 to $1 0 6 4 \mathsf { n m }$ [21]. Tungsten diselenide $( W S e _ { 2 } )$ ), a typical transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), has been utilized in high-performance phototransistors, exhibiting notable metrics such as a photoresponsivity of approximately $6 0 0 \ : \mathrm { m A / W _ { i } }$ , an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to $1 0 0 \%$ , response times (rise and decay) shorter than $8 \mu \mathsf { s } _ { : }$ , and a specific detectivity of around ${ 1 0 } ^ { 1 3 }$ Jones in vacuum [16]. Bismuth oxychalcogenides, such as 2D Bi $2$ $\mathsf { O } _ { 2 }$ Se, are also being explored as active materials for next-generation photodetectors [7]. Beyond conventional photodetectors, photosensitive 2D semiconductor materials like graphitic carbon nitride ( $g { - } C _ { 3 } N _ { 4 } )$ and tungsten disulfide $\mathrm { \Omega } [ W S _ { 2 } ]$ ) are employed in photoelectrochemical detection platforms [17]. Ultrathin $g { \mathrm { - } } C _ { 3 } N _ { 4 }$ ​ nanosheets, being a photosensitive semiconductor matching the band gap of ${ T i O } _ { 2 }$ ​ , have been synthesized into a $g { - } C _ { 3 } N _ { 4 } / T i O _ { 2 }$ ​ composite material for photoelectrochemical flow cells, offering advantages such as fast response, high sensitivity, and long-term stability [17]. Similarly, ultrathin $W S _ { 2 }$ ​ nanosheets, an n-type semiconductor with a wide band gap and high electron mobility, were combined with ${ T i O } _ { 2 }$ ​ nanoparticles to form a $W S _ { 2 } / T i O _ { 2 }$ ​ heterostructure used as a photoelectric detection material, achieving a detection limit of $0 . 7 2 \mu \mathrm { m o l } / \updownarrow$ for catechol [17]. Sulfonated graphene (SGE), with its high conductivity and large specific surface area, has also been composited with ${ T i O } _ { 2 }$ ​ to form $S G E  – T i O _ { 2 }$ ​ for photoelectrochemical sensing applications [17].​  

In solar cell technology, conductive 2D materials function primarily as transparent electrodes or interface layers. Graphene has been used as a transparent conductive film and as a layer for separating photogenerated carriers at the interface in graphene–silicon solar cells [43]. Furthermore, graphene nano-coatings have been incorporated into flexible photovoltaic panels, which is reported to significantly reduce the manufacturing cost of transparent deformable solar cells [13]. Performance improvements compared to conventional architectures can be observed in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) utilizing layered material-based electrodes. For example, PSCs fabricated with D/M/D (likely layered metal oxide-based)  

electrodes on a glass substrate achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of $1 0 . 7 \%$ , while flexible PSCs on PET substrates reached a maximum PCE of $7 . 6 \%$ [26]. This highlights the potential for 2D or layered conductive materials to serve as effective transparent electrodes in next-generation solar cells. Research also continues on integrating advanced materials like quantum dots in silicon heterojunction solar cells to exceed efficiencies of $2 3 . 5 \%$ , although the specific role of conductive 2D coatings in this particular work is not detailed in the provided digest [42].​  

For light-emitting diodes (LEDs), conductive 2D materials are primarily investigated for their role as transparent electrodes or for thermal management. MXene/silver nanowire (Ag NWs) composite transparent electrodes have been successfully applied in red and green transparent quantum dot light-emitting diodes (T-QLEDs) [22]. The red T-QLED demonstrated promising performance with a minimum turn-on voltage of $\displaystyle { 1 . 9 \vee } ,$ a maximum brightness of $2 1 , 0 1 5 \mathsf { c d m } ^ { - 2 }$ , and a maximum current efficiency (CE) of $2 3 . 1 2 \mathsf { c d } \mathsf { A } ^ { - 1 }$ [22]. While research on perovskite and quantum dot-based LEDs is active, exploring various aspects like crystal structure, emission engineering, and flexible devices [42], the direct application of conductive 2D materials as electrodes or transport layers in all these specific examples is not elaborated in the provided digest. Beyond electrical functions, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has been embedded in LED chips, reportedly lowering the chip surface temperature by $5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ compared to traditional LEDs, demonstrating their utility in thermal management crucial for device longevity and performance [5]. Overall, the integration of conductive 2D materials offers diverse pathways to enhance the performance and functionality of photodetectors, solar cells, and LEDs through their roles as active materials, charge transport layers, and transparent electrodes.​  

# 6.7 Thermal Management and Electromagnetic Shielding  

The increasing power density and miniaturization of modern electronic devices necessitate effective thermal management and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding solutions to ensure reliable performance and extend operational lifespan. Conductive two-dimensional (2D) materials, particularly graphene and its composites, have emerged as promising candidates for addressing these critical challenges [5,12].​  

In the realm of thermal management, 2D materials are highly valued for their exceptionally high intrinsic thermal conductivity [5,12]. This property enables them to efficiently dissipate waste heat generated by electronic components. Coatings or composites based on these materials can function effectively as heat sinks or thermal interface materials, facilitating heat transfer away from sensitive areas. For instance, graphene-based films have been demonstrated as flexible heat-dissipating materials suitable for high-power and high-integration systems, including LED lighting, computers, satellite circuits, and handheld devices [43]. The application of such highly thermally conductive 2D materials and their composites for thermal management in electronic devices significantly contributes to dissipating heat and improving device reliability [12,43].  

Beyond thermal management, conductive 2D materials and their composites are also extensively investigated for EMI shielding applications [12,43]. EMI shielding effectiveness is primarily achieved through mechanisms of absorption and reflection of electromagnetic waves [27]. The performance of shielding materials is intrinsically linked to their material properties, such as electrical conductivity, and microstructure [12]. A notable example is the use of graphene fiber (GF)/SiBCN composites. Studies have shown that the shielding effectiveness of these composites can be significantly enhanced through post-synthesis heat treatments. For instance, a total shielding effectiveness of 25.5 dB and a specific shielding effectiveness of  

$4 0 \mathrm { d B \cdot c m ^ { 3 } / g }$ were achieved after heat treatment at $1 7 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ [27]. This enhancement is attributed to microstructural evolution, specifically the increased crystallinity of free carbon and the formation of SiC nanocrystals. These structural changes create a more robust conductive network within the composite, which promotes both conduction losses and polarization losses, thereby improving EMI shielding performance [27]. The careful design and control of material properties and microstructure in conductive 2D material composites are therefore crucial for optimizing their effectiveness in EMI shielding applications.​  

# 7. Challenges and Future Directions  

![](images/9cacb521d333d1ee992d10887140d50e071625203db5778aba1080c50fa56098.jpg)  

Despite significant progress in the field of conductive 2D material coatings, several critical challenges must be addressed to enable their widespread adoption in electronics [38]. These challenges span across various aspects, including material synthesis, fabrication, performance, and integration, ultimately impacting the scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness required for commercial viability [9,12].  

A primary hurdle lies in achieving scalability and cost-effectiveness for industrial-scale production. Current synthesis methods, while effective at the laboratory level, struggle to deliver high-quality materials consistently over large areas and at a low cost [5,6]. Techniques like Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) face challenges in maintaining material quality and reducing defects during large-area growth [6,12]. Scalable exfoliation methods, particularly solution-based processing, show promise but require further optimization to improve quality and fully realize their cost advantages [17,39]. The cost is influenced by expensive precursors, energy consumption, and low throughput [9,23,26]. Developing low-thermal-budget growth methods and utilizing cost-effective precursors are crucial for reducing overall production costs [2,25]. Furthermore, limited mass production capabilities currently hinder market growth [9].  

Ensuring long-term stability and reliability under various environmental and operational stresses is another significant challenge [5,33]. 2D material coatings are susceptible to degradation from environmental factors such as oxygen, moisture, and contamination [26,34]. The presence of defects and surface functional groups can exacerbate environmental reactivity [12]. Under operational conditions, materials face mechanical stress, particularly in flexible electronics and applications like battery anodes where volume changes occur [25,32,35]. Electrical and thermal stresses can also lead to performance degradation over time [44]. The stability of interfaces, such as the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer in batteries, is also critical for long-term performance [23,35]. Achieving consistent and reproducible high-quality coatings is essential for ensuring reliable device performance [6].​  

Effective integration with existing silicon-based technology and manufacturing processes poses substantial technical complexities [33]. Compatibility with established semiconductor fabrication steps like lithography, etching, and metallization, especially for integration with silicon CMOS technology, remains a key hurdle [6,12,44]. Specific challenges include achieving low-resistance ohmic contacts between 2D materials and conventional metals, precise nanoscale patterning, and minimizing defects and contamination during the transfer process from growth substrates to target substrates [6,12,15,20]. While promising steps towards integrating 2D/CMOS chips using compatible processes have been demonstrated, systematic device integration for various 2D materials remains challenging [7,11].  

Beyond these overarching challenges, limitations of specific materials and current fabrication techniques must be addressed [4]. For instance, graphene's zero band gap limits its direct use in certain semiconductor applications without modification, while enhancing the conductivity of other materials like TMDs or addressing the intrinsic absorption in materials like $\mathsf { W S } _ { 2 }$ for optical applications are critical [17,36,44]. Material morphology and structural order also significantly impact performance, as seen with the resistivity of MXene films or charge transport in conductive polymers [1,28].  

Overcoming these challenges is essential for fully realizing the potential of conductive 2D material coatings across diverse electronic applications, from flexible displays and wearable electronics to high-performance transistors and energy storage devices [25,26,44].​  

Future research directions are focused on tackling these issues comprehensively. This includes the exploration and discovery of novel 2D materials with tailored electronic, optical, and mechanical properties suited for specific applications [12,17,33]. Significant effort is directed towards improving synthesis and deposition techniques for large-area, highquality, and cost-effective production, exploring methods like continuous CVD, high-yield exfoliation, direct growth on target substrates, and advanced solution processing [5,6,12,17,20,31,33,39]. Advancing interface engineering and integration strategies is crucial, focusing on developing robust contact schemes, minimizing transfer-induced damage, exploring direct growth methods compatible with existing semiconductor platforms, designing novel heterostructure architectures, and implementing effective passivation and encapsulation techniques [6,11,12,15,20,23,26,33]. Research also involves exploring new and emerging applications that leverage the unique properties of 2D materials [1,25,26]. Furthermore, improving characterization methods and leveraging theoretical simulation play vital roles in understanding material properties and guiding rational design [17]. Successfully navigating these challenges and driving innovation necessitates robust interdisciplinary collaboration between materials scientists, physicists, chemists, and electrical engineers, as well as industry stakeholders, to bridge the gap between fundamental research and technological implementation [9,18,45].​  

# 7.1 Scalability and Cost-Effectiveness  

The commercial viability of conductive 2D material coatings hinges critically on the ability to synthesize materials and deposit coatings at high volume and low cost to meet industrial demands [9,12]. While significant progress has been made in laboratory-scale synthesis, scaling up these processes presents substantial challenges.  

Current synthesis methods face limitations in achieving both high quality and large scale simultaneously at a low cost [12]. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) has enabled mass production of materials like graphene [12], with commercially available graphene currently produced via batch CVD processes [20]. However, challenges persist in achieving consistent material quality and reducing defect densities during large-area CVD growth [12]. Research is actively exploring semicontinuous or continuous CVD production processes to enhance throughput [20]. Scalable and reproducible CVD synthesis has been demonstrated for materials like large-area multi-walled carbon nanotubes (L-MWCNTs), yielding substantial quantities per synthesis run (e.g., 18 g) [32]. For other 2D materials, such as $B i _ { 2 } O _ { 2 } S e$ , large-scale material synthesis remains a significant challenge [7]. Furthermore, many 2D material synthesis techniques, particularly for magnets like $\boldsymbol { C r T e _ { 2 } }$ ​ , involve high synthesis temperatures, which is a barrier to scalable and cost-effective manufacturing, necessitating the development of low-thermal-budget growth methods [2].  

Exfoliation techniques, particularly solution-based processing, are highlighted as promising routes towards scalable synthesis [39]. Early research efforts focused on producing graphene derivatives like graphene nanoplatelets, graphene oxide, and reduced graphene oxide due to their relative ease of large-quantity production compared to pristine graphene [6]. Scalable production of these graphene derivatives remains a key priority [6]. Techniques such as electrochemical exfoliation have emerged as viable methods for preparing ultrathin nanosheets of materials like $W S e _ { 2 }$ ​ and BP, offering a pathway for large-scale exfoliation [33]. Sonochemical exfoliation is another approach considered more practical, economical, and scalable for producing nanolayers like borophene compared to techniques like Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) [34]. However, sonochemical exfoliation may result in lower crystallinity [34]. While solution-based processes show promise for scalability and cost-effectiveness, initial limitations and the need for post-processing techniques such as ultracentrifugation suggest that further optimization is required to fully exploit these advantages [39].​  

Cost factors associated with 2D material coatings are multifaceted. These include the cost of precursor materials, energy consumption during synthesis and deposition, and the overall throughput of the processes [12]. The use of expensive organic solvents and coordination compound precursors in the synthesis of colloidal nanomaterials, for instance, represents a significant cost barrier [23]. Generally, high production costs and low mass production capabilities are cited as major hurdles [9]. Comparing different deposition methods, solution-processed films are often favored for their potential to reduce costs compared to vacuum-based deposition techniques [26]. Similarly, sonochemical exfoliation offers a more economical approach than high-cost methods like MBE [34].​  

Potential strategies for cost reduction and process optimization are actively being explored. This includes developing synthesis techniques with a low thermal budget [2] and focusing on inherently scalable methods like solution processing [26,39], continuous CVD [20], and high-yield exfoliation [33,34]. The selection of cost-effective and commercially available precursor materials and reducing agents, such as using $N a _ { 2 } S _ { 2 } O _ { 4 }$ ​ for producing stable reduced graphene oxide dispersions, is crucial for commercial potential [25]. Furthermore, implementing high-throughput deposition techniques like the padding process, capable of processing large areas rapidly (e.g., approximately $1 5 0 \mathrm { m }$ fabric per minute), or utilizing simple, accessible application methods like paint [25,32], are key strategies for process optimization and cost reduction. Ongoing research efforts are concentrated on identifying and developing more scalable and cost-effective approaches across the entire production chain, from synthesis to deposition [12].  

# 7.2 Stability and Reliability  

The long-term stability and reliability of conductive two-dimensional (2D) material coatings are paramount for their successful integration into practical electronic devices [12]. These materials are susceptible to various degradation mechanisms driven by both environmental exposure and operational stress. Understanding these mechanisms and developing effective mitigation strategies are critical challenges in the field.  

Environmental degradation can arise from factors such as exposure to oxygen, moisture, temperature fluctuations, and UV light [12]. For instance, borophene nanolayers, while showing stability in solvent suspension, can form a superficial suboxide layer upon deposition and are prone to oxygen and carbon contamination from the ambient environment and solvents [34]. The presence of moisture has also been shown to influence the performance and potentially the stability of some 2D materials, such as enhancing the sensing performance of borophene for $N { \mathsf { O } } _ { 2 }$ [34]. For $\mathsf { M o O x } / \mathsf { S n O } _ { 2 }$ transparent electrodes, the effect of humid air on degradation has been investigated, with strategies like using seed layers explored to reduce this effect [26]. Moreover, side reactions, such as the formation of amorphous carbon during the large-scale production of graphene, can alter the intrinsic properties of the 2D material, potentially affecting its long-term stability [6]. The presence of defects and specific surface functional groups on the 2D material flakes can also significantly influence their reactivity and susceptibility to environmental degradation [12].  

Operational failure encompasses degradation occurring under electrical stress, thermal cycling, and mechanical wear during device operation [12]. In the context of energy storage, particularly for Si-based alloy anodes, repeated volume expansion and contraction during charge–discharge cycling lead to structural instability, which is a major cause of capacity fading and short cycle life [35]. This mechanical stress also increases the exposure of fresh anode surfaces to the electrolyte, resulting in the repeated formation and breakdown of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and continuous electrolyte consumption [35]. The stability and quality of the SEI layer are critical for the long-term cycling performance of battery electrodes based on 2D materials and other active materials [23]. Mechanical robustness is also crucial for flexible and wearable electronic applications. For example, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coated fabrics exhibited a significant increase in sheet resistance after washing cycles, from $3 6 . 9 4 \mathrm { k } \Omega / \mathsf { s q }$ initially to $7 0 . 3 2 \mathsf { k } \Omega / \mathsf { s q }$ after the first wash and further to 139.09 kΩ/sq after 10 cycles [25]. In contrast, paintable carbon nanotube (CNT) coatings demonstrated better stability in this regard, with the ECG signal remaining stable for more than 5 washing cycles [32]. Electrical and thermal stresses under operation can also cause degradation. High-Temperature Operating Life (HTOL) tests are routinely used to evaluate the performance degradation of devices like graphene MOSFETs under prolonged electrical and thermal loads [44]. The operational lifetime can vary significantly depending on the 2D material coating composition; for example, quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) utilizing MXene/Ag NW composite transparent top electrodes demonstrated a T50 lifetime of 1.7 hours, a substantial improvement compared to 0.04 hours for devices using only Ag NWs [22].​  

The stability of 2D material coatings is intrinsically linked to their structure, morphology, and interfaces. Factors like mass loading and porosity are important for rate capability and cycling stability in battery electrodes [23]. Defects, surface properties, and the nature of interfaces with substrates or encapsulation layers play a significant role in mediating degradation pathways [12].  

To enhance stability and extend the lifetime of devices utilizing 2D conductive coatings, various strategies are employed. These include material design and optimization, controlling the fabrication process to minimize defects and undesired reactions, and the application of passivation and encapsulation techniques [12]. Using composite structures, as shown with MXene/Ag NWs, can enhance operational lifetime [22]. Interfacial engineering, such as employing seed layers, can mitigate environmental degradation [26]. Further research into novel passivation layers, robust encapsulation methods, and intrinsic material property engineering is essential to overcome the stability challenges and enable widespread adoption of 2D material coatings in demanding electronic applications.​  

# 7.3 Integration with Existing Technologies  

Integrating conductive 2D material coatings into existing microelectronic fabrication lines presents significant complexities [33]. A primary challenge lies in ensuring compatibility with established semiconductor manufacturing processes, such as lithography, etching, and metallization, as well as existing device architectures, particularly silicon-based CMOS technology [6,12]. The seamless integration of 2D materials onto silicon wafers is crucial for realizing advanced applications like highdensity MRAM and spintronic logic device arrays [2] or enhancing data processing speeds in silicon chips [12].  

Several specific technical challenges impede this integration. One critical issue is the formation of low-resistance ohmic contacts between the 2D material and conventional metal electrodes [12]. Achieving precise patterning of 2D material films at the nanoscale using standard microfabrication techniques is another significant hurdle [12]. Furthermore, for 2D materials grown via methods like Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), the transfer process from the growth substrate to the target substrate is often fraught with difficulties, frequently introducing defects, wrinkles, or residues that degrade material quality and device performance [6,12]. Beyond these general challenges, systematic device integration can be particularly challenging for specific materials like $B i _ { 2 } O _ { 2 } S e$ [7].​  

Ongoing research efforts are focused on developing compatible fabrication processes and heterogeneous integration methods to address these issues. This includes exploring novel lithography and etching techniques tailored for 2D materials, developing improved contact strategies, and refining transfer processes to minimize defects. Efforts are also directed towards direct growth methods compatible with silicon platforms [2]. While the challenges are substantial, successful demonstrations of integrating 2D material-based structures, such as the integration of D/M/D electrodes into existing perovskite solar cell architectures, illustrate the potential for overcoming these hurdles through tailored strategies [26]. Continued research into material compatibility and processing techniques is essential for the widespread adoption of 2D material coatings in next-generation electronics [12].  

# 8. Conclusion  

This survey has summarized the diverse landscape of conductive 2D material coatings, encompassing various material types such as graphene, MXenes, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and borophene, among others [8,9,41]. We have discussed their synthesis methods, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), exfoliation techniques, and solution-based processing, highlighting how these methods influence the unique electronic, thermal, mechanical, and optical properties of the resulting coatings [3,20,34,39]. The remarkable properties of these materials underpin their promising applications across numerous electronic domains [6,12,41].​  

The potential of conductive 2D material coatings to revolutionize electronic applications is significant, particularly in areas demanding miniaturization, flexibility, and high performance. Integration of 2D materials with CMOS technology represents a major breakthrough for nanoelectronics, enabling high integration density and improved performance in advanced devices [11]. Their superior electrical and mechanical properties make them ideal candidates for flexible electronics, including flexible composites and e-textiles, which are poised to transform industries like smart textiles and wearable devices [3,4,18,25,32]. Furthermore, 2D materials show immense promise in energy devices, serving as electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries and enhancing anode performance [17,23,35]. Their utility extends to optoelectronics, demonstrated by high-performance transparent electrodes and photodetectors, and thermal management, with materials effectively reducing perceived temperature [4,5,21,22,26]. Emerging fields like spintronics also stand to benefit from the unique properties of 2D magnetic materials [2,37].​  

Despite the remarkable progress from fundamental science to initial engineering applications [5,12,31,38], significant challenges persist on the path to widespread commercialization. Scalability of synthesis methods, controlling material quality over large areas, and reducing production costs remain critical hurdles [7,9,20]. Issues related to long-term stability in various environments and seamless integration with existing electronic fabrication processes require further attention [7,9]. Specific challenges exist within applications, such as understanding charge storage mechanisms in 2D battery materials, mitigating volume expansion in Si-based anodes, and achieving simultaneous high-sensitivity detection of multiple analytes in sensors [17,35]. Research into p-type 2D semiconductors and intrinsic 2D magnetism is still in its nascent stages, necessitating fundamental investigations [33,37].  

Looking forward, fully realizing the transformative capabilities of conductive 2D material coatings for the next generation of electronics demands sustained and collaborative efforts. Continued fundamental research is essential to deepen our understanding of the intrinsic properties of these materials and their interfaces [24,38]. Simultaneously, applied development is crucial to overcome existing technical and economic barriers, focusing on scalable synthesis, precise control over structure and properties, and robust integration techniques [6,20,39]. The ongoing advancements across diverse research fronts indicate a promising future where conductive 2D material coatings play a central role in enabling highperformance, flexible, and efficient electronic devices [12,44].
