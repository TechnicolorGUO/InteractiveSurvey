# 3 Computational Modeling and Simulations of 2D Materials

## 3.1 First-Principles Calculations and Machine Learning Simulations

### 3.1.1 Oxidation Mechanisms and Electronic Properties
Oxidation mechanisms in two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), are critical for understanding their electronic properties and potential applications. The interaction of oxygen with the surface of these materials can lead to significant changes in their electronic structure, including bandgap modulation, defect formation, and charge transfer. For instance, the adsorption of oxygen on MoS2 and h-BN monolayers can induce the formation of defect states within the bandgap, which can significantly alter the material's electronic and optical properties. These changes are often attributed to the strong hybridization between the oxygen p orbitals and the d orbitals of the transition metals or the sp² orbitals of boron and nitrogen.

The dynamical charge-density response function, a fundamental observable in condensed matter physics, plays a crucial role in understanding the electronic properties of oxidized 2D materials. This function quantifies the longitudinal excitations of a system and is directly probed through techniques such as electron energy loss (EEL) and inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) spectroscopies. In the context of oxidation, the response function can reveal how the introduction of oxygen atoms affects the material's ability to screen charge and its electronic compressibility. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) are powerful tools for calculating the dynamical charge-density response function, providing insights into the microscopic charge response and the formation of excitonic effects in oxidized 2D materials [5].

Furthermore, the oxidation of 2D materials can be studied through the calculation of second-harmonic generation (SHG) and difference-frequency generation (DFG) spectra, which are sensitive to the symmetry and electronic structure of the material. These nonlinear optical techniques can provide detailed information about the surface and interface properties of oxidized 2D materials, including the presence of defect states and the degree of charge transfer. By applying these methods to materials like MoS2 and h-BN, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the interplay between oxidation, electronic properties, and potential applications in nanoelectronics and energy storage. The ability to control and manipulate these properties through oxidation opens new avenues for the design and optimization of 2D materials for advanced technological applications.

### 3.1.2 Band Gap Predictions and Computational Approaches
The accurate prediction of band gaps in two-dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for their application in various fields, including electronics, optoelectronics, and energy conversion [3]. Traditional density functional theory (DFT) methods, particularly those based on local and semilocal exchange-correlation functionals, often fail to provide reliable band gap values due to the self-interaction error, which leads to significant underestimation of the band gaps in semiconductors and insulators [3]. To address this issue, advanced computational approaches such as the GW approximation and hybrid density functionals have been developed and widely applied.

The GW method, particularly the G0W0 scheme, is considered a gold standard for band gap predictions due to its ability to account for many-body effects and provide converged fundamental gaps. However, the computational cost of GW calculations is high, making it less feasible for large-scale systems or routine applications. In contrast, hybrid density functionals, such as the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional, offer a practical compromise by incorporating a portion of exact exchange, which significantly improves the accuracy of band gap predictions while maintaining a lower computational cost compared to GW. The HSE06 functional has been successfully applied to a variety of 2D materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) like MoS2 and h-BN, yielding band gaps that are in better agreement with experimental data [1].

Despite the advancements in computational methods, the choice of approach depends on the specific requirements of the study and the available computational resources. For instance, while GW methods are essential for benchmarking and understanding the fundamental electronic properties of 2D materials, hybrid functionals are more suitable for large-scale simulations and materials screening. Additionally, the impact of structural relaxation and van der Waals interactions on the band gap must be carefully considered, as these factors can significantly influence the electronic structure. Machine learning techniques are also emerging as powerful tools for predicting band gaps, offering a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, especially when combined with high-throughput DFT calculations.

### 3.1.3 Strain Effects and Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect
Strain effects play a crucial role in the manipulation and enhancement of the Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect (QAHE) in two-dimensional (2D) materials [6]. By applying mechanical strain, the electronic band structure can be significantly altered, leading to changes in the topological properties of the material. For instance, biaxial strain can induce a bandgap opening or closing in certain 2D materials, thereby tuning the QAHE. This is particularly evident in materials like Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3, where strain can shift the Fermi level, affecting the quantization of the Hall resistance. The strain-induced modifications in the band structure are often accompanied by changes in the spin texture and the Berry curvature, which are essential for the QAHE.

Furthermore, the application of strain can also influence the magnetic properties of the material, which are critical for the realization of QAHE. In magnetic topological insulators (TIs), strain can modify the exchange interaction and the magnetic anisotropy, thereby affecting the alignment of magnetic moments. This can lead to a more robust QAHE, as demonstrated in experiments where uniaxial strain was applied to Cr-doped TI thin films, resulting in a higher critical temperature for the QAHE. Additionally, strain can induce a transition between different magnetic phases, such as from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic, which can have profound implications for the topological properties of the material.

The interplay between strain and the QAHE is not only limited to modifying the band structure and magnetic properties but also extends to the edge states. Strain can cause the edge states to become more localized or delocalized, depending on the type and magnitude of the strain applied. This can affect the transport properties of the material, such as the edge conductance and the dissipationless current. Understanding these strain-induced effects is crucial for the design and optimization of QAHE-based devices, particularly in the context of achieving room-temperature operation. Theoretical models and first-principles calculations have been instrumental in predicting and explaining these effects, providing a foundation for experimental validation and further technological advancements.

## 3.2 Time-Dependent and Many-Body Perturbation Theories

### 3.2.1 Multi-Valley States and Valley Polarization
In two-dimensional (2D) materials, the presence of multiple valleys in the electronic band structure can lead to a rich variety of physical phenomena, particularly when these valleys can be selectively manipulated. Multi-valley states arise from the degeneracy of the conduction and valence bands at distinct points in the Brillouin zone, known as valleys. These valleys can be characterized by their distinct angular momenta and Berry curvature, which play a crucial role in the electronic and optical properties of the material. The ability to control and polarize these valleys is essential for valleytronics, a field that aims to utilize the valley degree of freedom for information processing and storage.

Valley polarization, a key concept in valleytronics, involves the selective population of one valley over another, breaking time-reversal symmetry [7]. This can be achieved through various mechanisms, including the application of external magnetic fields or the use of circularly polarized light. The latter method, known as optical pumping, is particularly attractive due to its non-invasive nature and potential for ultrafast control. In monolayer materials such as SnS, the interplay between the linear and circular dichroism of the material can lead to the coexistence of multiple valley states, enabling the precise manipulation of electron dynamics on femtosecond timescales [7]. This ultrafast control is crucial for the development of high-speed valleytronic devices.

The study of multi-valley states and valley polarization in 2D materials not only provides fundamental insights into the electronic structure and optical properties of these systems but also opens up new avenues for technological applications. For instance, the ultrafast optical control of valley polarization in SnS monolayers has been demonstrated through time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulations, revealing the potential for real-time manipulation of valley populations [7]. Such control is essential for the realization of valley-based logic operations and memory storage, which could lead to significant advancements in low-power, high-speed electronics. Additionally, the coexistence of linear and circular dichroism in multi-valley materials offers a versatile platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena and designing advanced optoelectronic devices.

### 3.2.2 Dynamical Polarization and Nonlinear Optical Responses
Dynamical polarization plays a crucial role in understanding the nonlinear optical responses of materials, particularly in low-dimensional systems such as two-dimensional (2D) materials. The dynamical polarization function, derived from the microscopic charge response function, encapsulates the collective excitations and screening effects in these systems. In the context of 2D materials, the dynamical polarization function is essential for predicting and explaining phenomena such as plasmons, excitons, and their interactions with external electromagnetic fields. The real-time approach to calculating the dynamical polarization allows for a detailed description of the time-dependent behavior of these systems, providing insights into the underlying physics of nonlinear optical processes.

Sum frequency generation (SFG) and difference frequency generation (DFG) are second-order nonlinear optical processes that are highly sensitive to surfaces and interfaces, making them invaluable tools for studying 2D materials [8]. These techniques involve the interaction of two laser fields, resulting in the generation of a new frequency that is either the sum or the difference of the input frequencies. The second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, χ(2), is a key quantity in these processes and can be used to probe the symmetry and electronic structure of the material. In 2D materials, SFG and DFG can reveal information about the interlayer coupling, surface states, and excitonic effects, which are critical for understanding the material's optical and electronic properties [8]. For instance, SFG can be used to study exciton-exciton transitions, providing complementary information to pump-probe spectroscopy [8].

The robustness of linear dichroism and the evolution of valley polarization under strong laser fields are important aspects of nonlinear optical responses in 2D materials [7]. Linear dichroism, which is the differential absorption of light polarized along different crystallographic directions, can be used to probe the anisotropic properties of 2D materials. Under strong laser fields, the system can transition from a linear to a nonlinear regime, where the polarization and optical selection rules can be significantly altered [7]. This transition can lead to new phenomena, such as the ultrafast optical control of valley polarization and the manipulation of spin-valley coupling [7]. Understanding these nonlinear effects is crucial for the development of advanced optoelectronic devices and for exploring novel quantum phenomena in 2D materials. Theoretical and experimental studies in this area are essential for advancing the field and realizing the full potential of these materials in various applications.

### 3.2.3 Charge Response Functions and Collective Excitations
In the study of charge excitations in extended systems, the charge response function (CRF) plays a pivotal role in identifying and characterizing collective excitations [5]. The CRF, defined as the system's response to an external perturbation, is a complex function that contains poles corresponding to collective modes and a continuum of quasi-particle excitations. These collective modes, which manifest as isolated poles in the CRF, are distinct from the quasi-particle excitations, which form a branch-cut in the complex frequency plane. The ability to disentangle these features is crucial for understanding the underlying many-body physics and the nature of the excitations [8].

Starting from the microscopic definition of the CRF, which is independent of the system's dimensionality, we derive the basic spectroscopic quantities that allow for a systematic identification of collective excitations [5]. This derivation does not rely on phenomenological models, ensuring a more rigorous and fundamental approach. The CRF is expressed in terms of the electron density fluctuations and the external perturbation, and its poles correspond to the eigenfrequencies of the system's collective modes. By analyzing the spectral weight and linewidth of these poles, one can extract valuable information about the strength and lifetime of the collective excitations.

Furthermore, the CRF provides a framework for extracting important quantities such as the screening length scale, which is a measure of how effectively the system can screen an external charge. This length scale can be directly obtained from first-principles calculations, making it a powerful tool for understanding the screening properties of materials. The approach is demonstrated through a study of 2D materials, where the screening effects and collective excitations are particularly pronounced due to the reduced dimensionality [5]. The results are general and can be applied to a wide range of systems, from simple metals to complex layered materials, providing a comprehensive understanding of charge excitations and their role in determining material properties.

# 4 Experimental and Spectroscopic Characterization of 2D Materials

## 4.1 Spectroscopic Techniques for Material Analysis

### 4.1.1 Raman Spectroscopy and Vibrational Properties
Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for investigating the vibrational properties of materials, particularly in two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) like molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) [1]. By analyzing the Raman spectra, researchers can gain insights into the phonon modes, which are critical for understanding the material's electronic and mechanical behavior. In the case of few-layer MoS2, the Raman-active modes, specifically the E2g and A1g modes, provide valuable information about the layer-dependent vibrational properties. These modes are particularly sensitive to the number of layers and the stacking configuration, making them useful for characterizing the thickness and quality of the material.

The E2g mode, which is an in-plane vibration, and the A1g mode, which is an out-of-plane vibration, exhibit distinct energy shifts as the number of layers increases. For instance, the A1g mode energy (1.9 meV at the Γ point) aligns with Raman data for 6-layer systems, while the E2g mode corresponds to approximately 4.5 layers [9]. This layer-dependent behavior is attributed to the changes in the interlayer coupling and the associated modifications in the phonon dispersion relations. The crossing of phonon branches at q ≈ 0.112π/a along the ΓK direction further highlights the complex interplay between the vibrational modes and the crystal structure. These observations are consistent with both experimental measurements and theoretical predictions, reinforcing the reliability of Raman spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool for 2D materials.

Moreover, the finite-layer character of MoS2, as revealed by Raman spectroscopy, has significant implications for the material's functional properties [9]. The layer-dependent vibrational modes can influence various physical phenomena, such as electron-phonon coupling, exciton formation, and charge transfer processes. For example, the strong electron-phonon coupling in few-layer MoS2 can modulate the material's optical properties, leading to enhanced photoluminescence and nonlinear optical effects. Understanding these vibrational properties is essential for optimizing the performance of MoS2 in applications ranging from optoelectronics to quantum information processing. Additionally, the surface sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy makes it an ideal technique for probing the surface dynamics and defects in 2D materials, which can significantly affect their performance in device applications.

### 4.1.2 Photoluminescence Spectroscopy and Electron Doping
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for investigating the electronic and optical properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) [10]. The technique provides insights into the band structure, defect states, and carrier dynamics within these materials. In particular, the PL intensity and spectral features can be highly sensitive to the presence of defects, such as sulfur vacancies, which can act as trap states and significantly influence the radiative recombination processes. Recent studies have shown that sulfur vacancies in MoS₂ can mediate room-temperature PL, highlighting the importance of defect engineering in tuning the optical properties of TMDs.

Electron doping is another critical parameter that can profoundly affect the PL characteristics of 2D TMDs [10]. Doping can be achieved through various methods, including chemical doping, electrostatic gating, and the formation of heterostructures with other materials. For instance, the introduction of donor impurities or the application of an external electric field can shift the Fermi level, altering the balance between free carriers and localized states. This, in turn, can modify the PL spectrum, leading to changes in the emission intensity, linewidth, and peak position. The interplay between electron doping and PL is particularly evident in the temperature-dependent behavior of 2D TMDs, where the PL response can be modulated by variations in the substrate's spontaneous polarization and the screening of charges at the interface [10].

Understanding the relationship between electron doping and PL is essential for optimizing the performance of TMD-based optoelectronic devices. For example, controlled doping can enhance the efficiency of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and improve the sensitivity of photodetectors. Additionally, the ability to tune the PL properties through doping opens up new possibilities for applications in nonlinear optics and quantum information processing. The combination of PL spectroscopy and controlled electron doping thus provides a versatile platform for exploring the fundamental physics of 2D TMDs and developing advanced functional devices.

### 4.1.3 High-Resolution Helium Atom Scattering
High-Resolution Helium Atom Scattering (HAS) is a powerful technique for probing the surface structure and dynamics of materials with atomic resolution [9]. Operating at low energies (8-10 meV), helium atoms interact predominantly with the topmost layer of atoms, providing detailed information about the surface structure and low-energy dynamics [9]. This technique is particularly useful for studying two-dimensional (2D) materials, van der Waals heterostructures, and other systems where surface properties play a critical role. The low energy of the helium atoms ensures that the scattering is sensitive to the atomic-scale details of the surface, making HAS an ideal tool for investigating phenomena such as surface reconstruction, adsorption, and the formation of domain walls [9].

In recent years, HAS has been applied to study the electron-phonon coupling in various materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and graphene [2]. For instance, measurements of the electron-phonon coupling constant (mass-enhancement factor) λHAS in single-layer NbSe2 on bilayer graphene (BLG) and silicon carbide (SiC) have provided insights into the interplay between electronic and vibrational properties at the surface [11]. The thermal attenuation of the HAS specular peak, described by the Debye-Waller (DW) exponent, can be directly linked to the electron-phonon coupling strength [11]. This method has been extended to other conducting surfaces, allowing for a quantitative assessment of the coupling parameters that influence the material's electronic properties.

HAS has also been instrumental in exploring the unique properties of 2D materials, such as their direct bandgap in the visible spectrum and large exciton binding energy. These properties make 2D materials highly suitable for optoelectronic applications, and HAS can provide detailed information about the excitonic and trionic states at the surface. For example, cryogenic HAS measurements on monolayer MoS₂ have revealed the impact of domain walls on the spectral features of the material's emission, demonstrating the technique's ability to probe localized excitonic states and their evolution in the presence of structural defects [10]. Overall, HAS offers a comprehensive approach to understanding the surface physics of advanced materials, bridging the gap between atomic-scale structure and macroscopic properties.

## 4.2 Advanced Microscopy and Imaging Techniques

### 4.2.1 Atomic Force Microscopy and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) are pivotal techniques in the nanoscale characterization of surfaces, offering unparalleled resolution and versatility. AFM operates by measuring the forces between a sharp probe and the sample surface, which can be used to map topographical features, mechanical properties, and even electrical characteristics. The probe, typically a silicon or silicon nitride cantilever with a tip radius of a few nanometers, is deflected as it scans the surface, and these deflections are detected by a laser and photodiode system, allowing for the construction of a high-resolution image. AFM can operate in various modes, such as contact, tapping, and non-contact, each suited to different sample types and properties.

STM, on the other hand, relies on the quantum mechanical phenomenon of tunneling current, which occurs when a conducting tip is brought very close to a conducting or semiconducting surface. The tunneling current, which is exponentially sensitive to the tip-sample distance, is maintained constant by adjusting the tip's position using feedback mechanisms, thereby tracing the surface topography with atomic precision. STM not only provides topographical information but also allows for the manipulation of individual atoms and molecules, making it a powerful tool in nanotechnology and surface science. The ability of STM to resolve individual atoms has been instrumental in the study of surface reconstructions, adsorbates, and defects, as well as in the investigation of electronic properties at the nanoscale.

Both AFM and STM have been extensively applied to the study of two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), where their high spatial resolution is crucial for understanding the unique properties of these materials [12]. AFM has been used to map the thickness and morphology of 2D materials, while STM has provided insights into their electronic band structure and local density of states. The complementary nature of these techniques, with AFM's versatility in measuring various physical properties and STM's exceptional resolution in electronic structure, makes them indispensable in the characterization and development of novel 2D materials and devices.

### 4.2.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) are powerful techniques for characterizing the structural and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) such as MoS2 [1]. TEM provides high-resolution images of the atomic structure, allowing for the visualization of defects, grain boundaries, and layer stacking configurations. The combination of TEM with EELS enables a comprehensive analysis of the local electronic environment, including the identification of chemical elements and the determination of electronic band structures. High-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS) is particularly useful for probing the vibrational and electronic excitations in TMDs, offering insights into the phonon dispersion relations and the strength of electron-phonon coupling.

In the context of MoS2, HREELS has been employed to measure the ultra-low energy (< 10 meV) dispersion of the E2g and A1g phonon modes at the surface of the material. These measurements complement bulk studies using inelastic neutron scattering, which, while providing valuable data, lack the necessary resolution in both energy and momentum for detailed comparisons. HREELS, by contrast, can resolve the surface-sensitive modes with high precision, making it an essential tool for understanding the surface dynamics and the influence of the surface on the overall material properties. The HeSE (Helium Spin Echo) technique, which probes the outermost electron density, further enhances the surface sensitivity, allowing for the detailed examination of the surface modes and their dispersion characteristics [9].

The integration of TEM and EELS also facilitates the investigation of the effects of layer thickness and dimensionality on the electronic and vibrational properties of TMDs. For instance, the transition from monolayer to bulk MoS2 is accompanied by changes in the phonon modes and electronic band structure, which can be directly observed through EELS. This is crucial for understanding the fundamental physics of 2D TMDs and for optimizing their performance in various optoelectronic and nanoelectronic devices. By leveraging the complementary strengths of TEM and EELS, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between structure, composition, and functionality in these materials.

### 4.2.3 Optical Control and Moiré Twist Angle Manipulation
In the realm of two-dimensional (2D) materials, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the manipulation of optical properties through precise control of the moiré twist angle has emerged as a powerful tool for tailoring the electronic and optoelectronic behavior of these materials [10]. The moiré pattern, resulting from the slight misalignment of atomic lattices in van der Waals heterostructures, can lead to the formation of periodic superlattices that significantly alter the electronic band structure. These superlattices can induce the formation of flat bands, which are crucial for the emergence of strongly correlated electronic states, such as superconductivity and magnetism. The ability to precisely control the twist angle between layers of TMDs, therefore, offers a means to engineer these exotic states and explore their potential in advanced optoelectronic devices.

Optical control in TMD-based heterostructures is further enhanced by the interplay between the moiré superlattice and the optical properties of the constituent layers [10]. For instance, the twist angle can modulate the interlayer coupling strength, affecting the excitonic binding energy and the radiative recombination rates. This modulation can be exploited to fine-tune the photoluminescence (PL) characteristics of TMDs, enabling the development of tunable light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers. Additionally, the moiré-induced changes in the electronic band structure can lead to the appearance of new optical transitions, such as interlayer excitons, which exhibit distinct optical signatures and can be manipulated through external stimuli like electric fields or light. These features make TMD heterostructures with controlled twist angles highly attractive for applications in nonlinear optics and quantum information processing.

Moreover, the combination of optical control and moiré twist angle manipulation opens up new avenues for exploring the fundamental physics of 2D materials. For example, the controlled introduction of strain or the application of gate voltages can further modify the moiré superlattice, providing additional degrees of freedom for tuning the electronic and optical properties. This multifaceted approach not only enhances the functionality of TMD-based devices but also deepens our understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms governing the behavior of electrons and photons in these complex systems. As research in this area continues to advance, the integration of optical control and twist angle manipulation is expected to drive the development of next-generation optoelectronic devices with unprecedented performance and versatility.

# 5 Synthesis and Fabrication Techniques for 2D Material Devices

## 5.1 Large-Scale Screening and High-Throughput Methods

### 5.1.1 Ab Initio Transport Calculations and Carrier Mobilities
Ab initio transport calculations are pivotal in understanding and predicting the electronic transport properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, particularly in the context of carrier mobilities. These calculations involve solving the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) to account for the complex interactions between electrons and phonons. The inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Frohlich electron-phonon interactions is crucial for accurately modeling the transport properties of 2D materials, especially those with heavy elements like tungsten diselenide (WSe2). The relaxation time approximation (RTA) is often used as a first step, but for a more comprehensive understanding, full ab initio BTE calculations are necessary.

These advanced computational methods allow researchers to explore the intrinsic limits of carrier mobilities in 2D materials, which are influenced by various scattering mechanisms such as phonon scattering, impurity scattering, and boundary scattering [13]. By systematically varying the material parameters and environmental conditions, ab initio transport calculations can identify the key factors that govern carrier mobility. For instance, the presence of defects and grain boundaries can significantly reduce mobility, while the application of strain or the introduction of dopants can enhance it. The ability to predict and optimize carrier mobilities through computational screening is essential for the design of high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials.

Moreover, the integration of ab initio transport calculations with high-throughput computational techniques enables the rapid identification of novel 2D materials with superior transport properties. This approach has been successfully applied to a variety of 2D systems, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), black phosphorus, and graphene derivatives [2]. The computational insights gained from these studies not only advance the fundamental understanding of carrier dynamics in 2D materials but also guide experimental efforts towards the synthesis and characterization of materials with tailored properties for specific applications.

### 5.1.2 Robotic Automation and AI-Driven Synthesis
Robotic automation and AI-driven synthesis represent transformative advancements in the field of 2D materials research, enabling the scalable and reproducible production of these materials while optimizing their properties for various applications. Robotic automation, particularly in the context of mechanical exfoliation and stacking, has emerged as a powerful tool for the precise fabrication of 2D material assemblies [14]. By automating the process of exfoliating bulk materials into thin layers and subsequently stacking these layers in controlled configurations, robotic systems can achieve a level of precision and consistency that is difficult to attain through manual methods. This capability is crucial for the development of complex heterostructures, where the alignment and integration of multiple 2D materials are essential for achieving desired functionalities.

AI-driven synthesis complements robotic automation by providing a data-driven approach to material discovery and optimization. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast datasets of material properties and synthesis conditions, identifying patterns and correlations that may not be apparent through traditional experimental methods. These algorithms can predict optimal synthesis parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and precursor concentrations, to produce 2D materials with desired characteristics. Furthermore, AI can facilitate the exploration of new material compositions and structures, accelerating the discovery of novel 2D materials with unique properties. For instance, AI-driven high-throughput screening of 2D materials databases, such as the Materials Cloud 2D Database (MC2D) and the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB), can identify promising candidates for further experimental investigation [13].

Together, robotic automation and AI-driven synthesis are revolutionizing the field of 2D materials research by addressing key challenges related to scalability, reproducibility, and property optimization. The integration of these technologies not only enhances the efficiency and reliability of material synthesis but also opens up new possibilities for the development of advanced 2D materials-based devices and systems. As these technologies continue to evolve, they are likely to play an increasingly central role in the realization of next-generation electronic, photonic, and energy-related applications.

### 5.1.3 Element Substitution and High-Throughput Calculations
Element substitution within the same group is a powerful strategy for designing new 2D materials, particularly those with multifunctional properties [1]. This approach leverages the periodic table to replace elements in known 2D materials with others from the same group, often leading to materials with similar structural frameworks but altered electronic, mechanical, or optical properties. For instance, the substitution of platinum (Pt) with palladium (Pd) or other transition metals in PtI2 can yield 2D materials with enhanced catalytic activity, improved electrical conductivity, or unique magnetic properties.
