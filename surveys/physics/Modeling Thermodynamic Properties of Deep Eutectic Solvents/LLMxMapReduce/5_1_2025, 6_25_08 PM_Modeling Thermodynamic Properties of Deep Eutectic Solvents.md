# 1. Introduction  

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as promising, sustainable alternatives to traditional organic solvents and ionic liquids across various chemical and industrial processes [2,10,14,21,32]. Characterized by their low melting points, often below that of their individual components, DESs typically consist of a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and a hydrogen bond donor (HBD) which interact via hydrogen bonding networks [10,15]. Compared to conventional solvents and even ionic liquids, DESs offer significant advantages, including ease of preparation, lower cost, reduced toxicity, lower volatility, enhanced biodegradability, and inherent tunability of their physicochemical properties through the judicious selection and ratio of HBA and HBD components [2,5,10,14,21,32].  

The unique properties of DESs have led to their rapidly expanding application landscape across diverse fields. They are increasingly explored in pharmaceutical applications for drug solubilization and delivery [3,14,15], in critical metal metallurgy for separation and purification [21], and in the processing and conversion of biomass, including the extraction of lignin and proteins [30,35,37]. Furthermore, DESs show promise in $C O _ { 2 }$ capture technologies [3,13,24] and various separation processes [2]. The successful design, scale-up, and optimization of these processes critically depend on a fundamental understanding and accurate modeling of the thermodynamic properties of DESs and their mixtures with solutes or other solvents [1,3,4,5,10,13,14,21,24,32,37]. Key properties like phase behavior (e.g., solid–liquid, vapor–liquid, and gas solubility equilibria) [1,24], viscosity [13], and heat capacity [4] directly influence process efficiency, feasibility, and economic viability. For instance, high viscosity, a known drawback for some DESs, impacts mass and heat transfer rates, necessitating mitigation strategies like cosolvent addition, which in turn requires accurate property prediction models [13].  

Despite their significant potential and growing applications, the complex nature of DESs presents fundamental challenges in accurately modeling their thermodynamic properties. The intricate network of hydrogen bonds and other specific intermolecular interactions between the HBA, HBD, and any added solutes or solvents is not yet fully understood theoretically [10,15,37]. This complexity makes it challenging to develop robust and predictive thermodynamic models applicable across the vast compositional and temperature ranges relevant to industrial processes. Accurate modeling requires accounting for these specific interactions and their impact on macroscopic properties.​  

This review aims to provide a comprehensive survey of the current state of research in modeling the thermodynamic properties of deep eutectic solvents. It will summarize key experimental techniques used to measure these properties, explore the various theoretical and computational modeling approaches employed, and highlight examples of how thermodynamic modeling is applied to understand and optimize DES-based processes in different application areas.  

# 2. Fundamentals of Deep Eutectic Solvents  

![](images/5a3a9b5b1d6be235ec12e43812ffafb51390475173312c806dcbba9b1cb0efdc.jpg)  

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) represent a class of promising green solvents typically formed by mixing two or more components, specifically a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and a hydrogen bond donor (HBD), which exhibit a eutectic point significantly below the melting points of the individual constituents [2,14,21,32]. This defining characteristic arises from  

strong intermolecular interactions between the components. Common HBAs include quaternary ammonium salts like choline chloride (ChCl) [2,21,32], tetraalkylammonium salts [5,21], and metal salts [10,21], while HBDs encompass a broad range of compounds such as alcohols (e.g., ethylene glycol, glycerol, polyols) [6,14], carboxylic acids [7], urea, amides, and carbohydrates [10,21,32].​  

The formation of DESs and their characteristically low melting points are primarily attributed to the establishment of extensive hydrogen bonding networks between the HBA and HBD molecules [2,3,24,32]. This interaction typically involves the donation of a hydrogen atom from the HBD to an electronegative site on the HBA, often the halide anion in salt-based DESs [6,32]. These strong interactions disrupt the crystal lattice structures of the individual solid components, requiring less energy to melt the mixture compared to the pure substances [24,30]. This lattice disruption, facilitated by charge delocalization and increased effective size of interacting species [32], results in the significant melting point depression defining the eutectic behavior [2,32].  

DESs can be classified based on their constituent components, providing a framework for understanding their diverse properties and potential applications. A common classification system categorizes DESs into five types: Type I (metal chlorides with quaternary ammonium salts), Type II (choline chloride with hydrated metal chlorides), Type III (choline chloride with HBDs like amides, alcohols, carboxylic acids, or carbohydrates), Type IV (transition metal chlorides with urea), and Type V (organic phenols with organic alcohols, free of halide anions and metal cations) [10,21]. Another relevant classification is based on their miscibility with water, categorizing them as hydrophilic, quasi-hydrophobic, or hydrophobic [2,21].​  

A key advantage of DESs is the tunability of their physicochemical properties by varying the type of HBA and HBD components and their relative molar ratios [7,10]. The specific chemical nature and structure of the components dictate the strength and characteristics of the intermolecular interactions formed [7]. The molar ratio is particularly influential, affecting the density and strength of the hydrogen bonding network [6], which in turn impacts macroscopic properties such as viscosity [13] and solvation power for specific solutes [28]. Optimized molar ratios are often determined for specific applications [1,5,6,14,15,28]. Beyond hydrogen bonding, electrostatic forces between charged species and van der Waals forces also contribute to the overall liquid structure and properties [21]. The intricate balance and interplay of these interactions determine the unique supramolecular structure of DESs, which underpins their distinct physicochemical properties and functional capabilities [2]. Key properties influenced by composition and interactions include melting point, density, and viscosity [3,13]. The ability to tailor these properties through compositional variation makes DESs highly versatile for a wide range of applications.  

# 2.1 Composition, Classification, and Formation Mechanisms  

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are typically formed from a mixture of a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and a hydrogen bond donor (HBD), exhibiting a eutectic point significantly below the melting points of the individual components [2,32]. A wide variety of compounds serve as HBAs and HBDs. Common HBAs include quaternary ammonium salts, such as choline chloride (ChCl) [2,32], which is frequently used due to its low toxicity [32], as well as tetraalkylammonium salts [21], metal salts [10,21], phosphorus salts [21], imidazolium-based salts, quaternary phosphonium salts, dication based salts, inner salts, molecular imidazole, its analogs [2], and monoterpenes like thymol [3]. HBDs encompass a broad range of organic molecules, including amides, alcohols, organic acids, carbohydrates [21], amino acids, sugars, amines [32], thiourea, imidazole, azole, phenol, water, urea, ethylene glycol (EG), and glycerol (Gly) [2]. Specific examples of frequently studied HBDs include ethylene glycol [13,14,35,36], various polyols such as butanediols, propanediol, glycerol, pentanediol, pentanetriol, and xylitol [6], lactic acid [24,28], urea [2,10,32], carboxylic acids [3,7], 1,6-hexanediol [5], aniline [13], fatty acids [3], sorbitol [1], and p-hydroxybenzoic acid [30].  

The specific chemical nature and structure of the HBA and HBD significantly influence DES formation and properties [7]. The molar ratio of HBA to HBD is a critical parameter affecting the strength of the hydrogen bonding network [6] and the characteristics of the resulting DES, which in turn impacts performance in applications such as extraction efficiency [28]. Optimized molar ratios have been determined for various systems, such as 1:2 for ChCl:butanediol [6] and ChCl:EG/Gly [14], 1:3 for ChCl:DL-lactic acid [28], and 1:1 for Lidocaine:Ibuprofen [15] and ChCl:Sorbitol [1]. Ternary mixtures involving cosolvents can also be formed, further tuning properties [13].  

The formation of DESs is driven by strong hydrogen bond interactions between the HBA and HBD [2]. These interactions typically involve the donation of a hydrogen atom from the HBD to an electronegative atom, often the halide anion, of the  

HBA [6,32]. For instance, hydrogen bonds form between the Cl atom of ChCl and the H atom of the O–H group in polyols [6]. In organic acid-based DESs like Lidocaine Ibuprofen, a COO–H⋯N (tertiary amine) hydrogen bond is crucial [15]. This extensive hydrogen bonding establishes a three-dimensional network throughout the bulk liquid [32]. A key aspect of this network is charge delocalization [32]. The strong interactions between the HBD and the halide ion of the HBA effectively delocalize the charge and increase the size of the interacting species, weakening the strong lattice forces present in the pure solid components [24,30,32].​  

The primary mechanism underlying the eutectic effect in DESs is the significant depression of the melting point compared to the individual constituents [2,32]. This occurs because the formation of the hydrogen bond network disrupts the crystal lattice structure of the solid HBA and HBD [24,30]. The enthalpy required to break the individual crystal lattices is reduced by the formation of the new, stable hydrogen-bonded liquid structure, resulting in a lower melting point for the mixture. Classic examples demonstrate this phenomenon: choline chloride (m.p. $3 0 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ ) and urea (m.p. $1 3 4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ ) form a DES with a eutectic point of $1 2 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ [2,32], while Lidocaine (m.p. $6 8 - 6 9 ^ { \circ } ( )$ and Ibuprofen (m.p. $7 5 \mathrm { - } 7 7 ^ { \circ } C )$ ) form a 1:1 DES that is liquid at room temperature with a glass transition temperature of $- 2 7 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ [15].​  

DESs are typically classified based on their components to facilitate understanding and prediction of their behavior. One common classification system categorizes DESs into five types based on the nature of the ligands [10]:  

1. Type I: Metal chlorides ( $M C l _ { x }$ ​ , where M can be Zn, Sn, Fe, Al, Ga, In) mixed with quaternary ammonium salts [10,21].   
2. Type II: Choline chloride combined with hydrated metal chlorides ( $M C l _ { x } \cdot y H _ { 2 } O$ , where M can be Cr, Co, Cu, Ni, Fe) [10,21].   
3. Type III: Choline chloride mixed with hydrogen bond donors, such as amides, alcohols, carboxylic acids, or carbohydrates [10,21].​   
4. Type IV: Mixtures of transition metal chlorides and urea [10,21].   
5. Type V: DESs composed solely of organic phenols and organic alcohols, which are notable for being halide-anion and metal-cation free [10].  

Another categorization divides DESs into hydrophilic, quasi-hydrophobic, and hydrophobic types based on their solubility in water, which is relevant for their application in separation processes [21]. These classifications provide a framework for understanding the diverse compositional space of DESs and offer insights into potential interactions and properties based on the chemical nature of their constituent components.  

# 2.2 Intermolecular Interactions and Structure  

The unique physicochemical properties of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are intrinsically linked to the complex network of intermolecular interactions present within their structure [2,21]. Among these, hydrogen bonding stands out as the primary interaction dictating DES formation and characteristics [2,3,24]. However, other interactions, including Lewis acid-base interactions and van der Waals forces, also contribute significantly to the overall behavior [21]. In certain applications, such as protein extraction, hydrophobic interactions within the DES matrix or between the DES and the target molecule are also relevant [37].​  

Experimental techniques have been instrumental in elucidating the nature of these hydrogen bonding interactions. Solidstate nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) experiments, specifically 2D 1H–1H NOESY and ROESY, have identified specific intermolecular hydrogen bonds, such as the strong interaction between the carboxylic acid proton of ibuprofen and the tertiary amine nitrogen of lidocaine in Lid $\cdot$ Ibu DES [15]. Similarly, spectroscopic methods like Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), Far-IR, 1H NMR, and 35Cl NMR, often coupled with quantum chemistry calculations, have provided insights into hydrogen bonding in choline chloride (ChCl)-polyol systems [6,30]. These studies reveal predominant hydrogen bonding between the chloride anion of ChCl and the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl groups in polyols [6,30]. The strength and nature of hydrogen bonds in various DES-relevant systems, including ionic liquids and binary mixtures, have also been explored using FTIR and computational methods [33]. Advanced simulation techniques like ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) have been employed to understand how factors like the position of hydroxyl groups influence intermolecular interactions and the overall hydrogen bonding network [31]. Research efforts are continuously improving methods for studying these critical intermolecular forces [23].  

The strength and extent of the hydrogen bonding network are highly dependent on the composition of the DES. In ChClpolyol systems, for instance, the hydrogen bond strength between the chloride anion and the polyol's hydroxyl groups decreases with an increasing number of carbon atoms between hydroxyl groups and a decreasing number of hydroxyl groups in the polyol [6]. Furthermore, changing the ratio of components can redistribute hydrogen bonding; increasing butanediol content in a ChCl-butanediol system weakens the hydrogen bonds between choline cations and chloride anions while strengthening interactions among butanediol molecules [6]. The total quantity of hydrogen bonds can also vary with composition, as observed in a deep eutectic gel where the number of hydrogen bonds initially increased and then decreased upon the introduction of ethylene glycol [36]. This modulation of hydrogen bonding significantly impacts properties; for example, the optimal number of hydrogen bonds can lead to synergistic effects improving properties like electromagnetic wave absorption performance [36].  

The pervasive and extensive hydrogen-bonding networks are a defining characteristic of DESs [13]. These networks are directly responsible for several macroscopic properties, including the often-observed high viscosity of DESs [13]. The addition of cosolvents like water, acetonitrile (ACN), or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can disrupt this intricate network. For instance, adding water to ChCl:ethylene glycol (1:2) leads to the solvation of chloride ions by water molecules, thereby weakening the strong hydrogen bonding between the chloride anion and ethylene glycol [13]. This disruption alters the DES structure and consequently its properties.​  

Beyond hydrogen bonding, electrostatic forces between charged species, such as the choline cation and chloride anion in ChCl-based DESs, play a fundamental role in their formation and structure. Van der Waals forces are also universally present and contribute to the overall cohesive energy and structure [21]. The interplay and balance between these different intermolecular forces—hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, and van der Waals forces—determine the unique supramolecular liquid structure of DESs [2]. This specific structure, characterized by the hydrogen bond network and potential structural microheterogeneity [33], confers enhanced solvation capabilities and provides a high affinity for compounds capable of donating or accepting electrons or protons [2,32]. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of these intricate intermolecular interactions is crucial for modeling and predicting the thermodynamic behavior of DESs.​  

# 2.3 Preparation Methods  

The preparation of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) is a critical initial step influencing their final properties. Various methods have been reported in the literature for synthesizing DESs, with common approaches including heating and stirring, vacuum evaporation, freeze-drying, microwave radiation, grinding, and ultrasonic methods [10]. Among these, the mixed heating method is the most widely adopted due to its simplicity and scalability [21].​  

The typical heating and stirring method involves mixing the hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and hydrogen bond donor (HBD) components at a specific molar ratio. The mixture is then heated—often in a water bath or oil bath—and stirred until a homogeneous liquid is formed [14,15,28]. Reported heating temperatures vary, such as $8 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for ChCl-based DESs [13,28] or $1 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ for Lidocaine–Ibuprofen [15], with stirring typically continuing for periods ranging from 1 hour to 4 hours, or until homogeneity is achieved [13,14,15]. After heating and stirring, the mixture is often cooled to room temperature, sometimes with an overnight resting period to observe stability [28]. This method is amenable to scale-up and automation, as demonstrated by the use of robotic platforms for high-throughput preparation [13].  

Other methods like grinding offer an alternative that avoids high temperatures, potentially suitable for thermosensitive components. Freeze-drying, vacuum evaporation, microwave, and ultrasonic methods represent more specialized techniques, though detailed comparisons regarding their impact on DES properties, speed, and scalability compared to heating are less elaborated in the provided digests [10,21]. The grinding method is mentioned as one of the main methods alongside mixed heating and freeze-drying [21].  

Crucially, the preparation method and subsequent handling can significantly influence the final physicochemical properties of DESs, which in turn affects the accuracy of experimental measurements and the validity of subsequent model validations. Residual water content is a primary concern, as water can disrupt the hydrogen bonding network characteristic of DESs and alter properties such as viscosity, density, and melting point. Some studies explicitly measure the water content using techniques like Karl–Fisher titration and employ vacuum drying or vacuum ovens to remove moisture and excess impurities after preparation [14,15]. Furthermore, the thermal history—including heating temperatures and durations during synthesis and subsequent storage conditions (e.g., storing at room temperature or under vacuum)—can subtly affect the long-term stability and phase behavior of DESs [15,28]. Therefore, meticulous control over the preparation process, including minimizing water uptake and documenting thermal history, is essential to ensure reproducibility and reliability of experimental data used for modeling thermodynamic properties.  

# 3. Experimental Techniques for Determining Thermodynamic Properties  

The accurate determination of thermodynamic properties is paramount for understanding the behavior, optimizing the composition, and predicting the performance of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) across a wide range of applications.

Experimental techniques provide foundational data essential for both fundamental research and practical engineering design, serving as benchmarks for validating theoretical models and parameterizing equations of state or activity coefficient models. The diverse nature of DES compositions and their often unique physical characteristics, such as high viscosity and potential thermal instability, necessitate the application and sometimes adaptation of various experimental methods. This section provides an overview of common experimental techniques classified by the thermodynamic property they measure, highlighting their principles, applicability to DES systems, and associated challenges.  

Characterization of thermal properties is crucial for defining the operational temperature range and phase state of DESs. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) is a fundamental technique for identifying key thermal events such as melting points, crystallization points, and eutectic points [30,39]. DSC experiments reveal the melting point depression characteristic of DES formation compared to pure components and can determine liquidus and solidus temperatures [30,39]. Thermal analysis can also be employed \textit{operando} to track phase changes in complex reaction mixtures involving DESs [38]. Thermal stability, particularly important for high-temperature applications, is typically assessed using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), with high-resolution TGA recommended for detailed decomposition studies [16,35]. Other relevant thermal properties like heat capacity are also studied, especially in applications such as thermal energy storage [43].  

Volumetric and transport properties are vital for fluid dynamics, mass transfer, and process design. Density, a key volumetric property, is commonly measured using oscillating U-tube densimeters, such as the Anton Paar DSA 5000, which offer high accuracy and often simultaneous determination of speed of sound [14]. Density measurements reveal dependence on temperature and composition [2,30]. Viscosity, a critical transport property reflecting resistance to flow, is often significantly higher in DESs than in conventional solvents or even ionic liquids [2]. Techniques range from highthroughput viscometers suitable for rapid screening across temperature and composition spaces [13] to conventional rotational stress-controlled rheometers for detailed rheological studies [17]. Speed of sound measurements, often paired with density measurements, provide insights into compressibility and molecular interactions [14]. Electrical conductivity, relevant for electrochemical applications, is generally lower in DESs due to the presence of neutral hydrogen bond donors but still provides information on ion mobility and solvent structure [2,7]. Techniques like Pulsed Field Gradient Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (PFG-NMR) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) or Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) are also employed to measure diffusion coefficients, offering further insights into molecular transport and ionicity [16,18].​  

Phase equilibrium properties, including vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE), solid–liquid equilibrium (SLE), liquid–liquid equilibrium (LLE), and solubility, dictate the behavior of DESs in separation processes and chemical reactions [32]. VLE can be investigated through activity coefficient measurements, for instance, using Gas–Liquid Chromatography (GLC) at infinite dilution [5]. Estimating VLE from more accessible SLE data has also been explored [1]. SLE data are frequently determined using DSC by identifying melting and crystallization points, contributing to the construction of phase diagrams [1,39]. Techniques like \textit{operando} powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) combined with thermal analysis are valuable for studying complex phase behavior and composition changes in multicomponent systems [38]. While not detailed extensively in the provided digests, determining solubility parameters is also relevant for understanding interactions and predicting solubility.  

A key challenge across many of these measurements is the often high viscosity of DESs, which can complicate sample handling, require longer equilibrium times, and impact the performance of standard equipment. Techniques like highthroughput viscometry are designed to facilitate measurements on such systems [13]. Moreover, techniques like MagicAngle Spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy can characterize mobility changes and hydrogen bonding dynamics over a wide temperature range in viscous systems, providing structural and dynamic insights relevant to thermodynamic properties [15]. Thermal decomposition at elevated temperatures and hygroscopicity (water absorption) are other challenges that require careful control of experimental conditions and sample preparation to ensure data reliability. The accurate and systematic collection of experimental data across varying compositions and temperatures is crucial for validating theoretical models and enabling reliable predictions of DES thermodynamic behavior. Spectroscopic methods such as infrared (IR) spectroscopy also contribute by probing intermolecular interactions, which underpin the macroscopic thermodynamic properties of DESs [23].​  

# 3.1 Thermal Properties  

The characterization of thermal properties is fundamental to understanding the physical state and stability of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) across various conditions, which is crucial for their design and application. Techniques rooted in thermal analysis are widely employed for this purpose [38]. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) stands out as a primary method utilized to probe the thermal behavior of DESs and their components [30,39].  

Experimental thermograms obtained from techniques like DSC provide insights into phase transitions, including melting and solidification points. For pure components constituting DESs, DSC measurements yield their respective melting points, as observed for PB at $2 1 4 ^ { \circ } C$ and choline chloride (ChCl) at $3 0 2 ^ { \circ } C$ [30]. In contrast, DESs are characterized by a significantly lower eutectic point temperature compared to the melting points of their individual constituents—a phenomenon known as melting point depression, which is a defining feature of DES formation [2,30]. DSC is capable of identifying this eutectic depression and determining the liquidus and solidus temperatures of DESs [39]. Thermal analysis can also be applied to complex reaction mixtures to identify the presence of eutectic molten phases [38]. Understanding the phase diagrams of DESs, often informed by thermal analysis, highlights how the eutectic point temperature relates to the composition and potentially the strength of interactions—such as hydrogen bonds—within the system [2].​  

Beyond phase transitions, thermal stability is a critical property, particularly for applications involving elevated temperatures. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) is recognized as an essential technique for evaluating the thermal stability of DESs [16,35]. High-resolution TGA is specifically recommended for the accurate assessment of DES thermal decomposition behavior [16].​  

Thermal properties, such as heat capacity, are also highly relevant in applied contexts like thermal energy storage and heat transfer enhancement [43]. While experimental studies investigate these properties for specific DES formulations—such as sodium acetate trihydrate/glycerol DES nanofluids—the detailed challenges associated with accurately determining heat capacity for complex, often highly viscous, DES mixtures are not explicitly elaborated within the scope of the provided literature digests. Similarly, although the glass transition temperature is a significant characteristic for highly viscous or amorphous materials, its specific importance for DESs and its determination from thermograms are not detailed in the provided information. Complex thermal behaviors, such as multiple melting processes, have been observed in other material systems under varying conditions [20], suggesting that the thermal analysis of some DESs might also present complexities depending on their composition and structure, though specific examples within the context of DESs are not provided in the digests.​  

# 3.2 Volumetric and Transport Properties  

The volumetric and transport properties of deep eutectic solvents (DESs), including density, viscosity, speed of sound, and conductivity, are fundamental for understanding their behavior in various applications and are crucial parameters for process design and fluid dynamics simulations [2,43]. Accurate experimental determination of these properties is therefore essential.​  

Density measurements in DES systems can be performed using oscillating U-tube densimeters, such as the Anton Paar DSA 5000 device, which can simultaneously measure density and speed of sound [14]. This instrument operates at frequencies around 3 MHz and allows for precise temperature control, with reported accuracies for density measurements as low as $0 . 0 1 5 \mathrm { k g } \mathrm { m } ^ { - 3 }$ [14]. Experimental data indicate that densities of DESs formed from quaternary ammonium salts (QASs) or quaternary phosphonium salts with hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) are typically greater than that of water [2]. Density is influenced by both the hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and HBD components [2]. Consistent with the behavior of ordinary solvents, the density of a DES generally decreases with increasing temperature [2], as exemplified by the reported density of a ChCl-PB DES decreasing with temperature [30].​  

Viscosity, another critical transport property, quantifies the resistance to flow and significantly impacts mass and heat transfer processes. Measurement techniques include high-throughput methods utilizing instruments like the VROC initium one plus viscometer [13] and conventional rotational stress-controlled rheometers with geometries such as Couette [17]. High-throughput viscometry allows for rapid screening across temperature ranges, such as 298 to $3 2 3 \mathsf { K }$ in 5 K increments, with measurements repeated multiple times to ensure reliability [13]. Rotational rheometry enables controlled shear rate experiments, typically within ranges like $\displaystyle 1 0 0 { \mathrm { { s } } } ^ { - 1 }$ to $\mathrm { { 1 s ^ { - 1 } } }$ , at various temperatures [17]. Most DESs exhibit higher viscosities compared to ionic liquids (ILs), although exceptions exist, such as the choline chloride–ethylene glycol $( C h C l + E G )$ ) DES [2]. The study of viscosity is pertinent to applications like DES-based nanofluids for thermal management, where flow properties are paramount [43].​  

Speed of sound measurements, often performed concurrently with density using devices like the Anton Paar DSA 5000 [14], provide insight into the adiabatic compressibility and intermolecular interactions within the solvent structure. The standard uncertainty for speed of sound measurements using this method can be as low as $\mathrm { { 1 m } \mathrm { { s } ^ { - 1 } } }$ [14]. Changes in speed of sound with temperature and composition reflect alterations in molecular packing and the strength of interactions.  

Electrical conductivity is a key property related to charge transport, particularly important for electrochemical applications. Measurements of conductivity in DESs, alongside viscosity, provide information on ion mobility and the availability of free volume or voids within the solvent structure, drawing parallels with ILs and molten salts [7]. The conductivity of DESs is generally lower than that of ILs [2]. This difference is often attributed to the presence of non-conductive HBDs, which dilute the charge carriers (ions) and reduce overall conductivity [2]. Ionicty, a related concept, can be assessed using Walden plots or techniques like pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG-NMR), which also provide information on species diffusion [16].​  

Comparing measurement methodologies, techniques like the Anton Paar DSA 5000 offer high accuracy and the benefit of simultaneous density and speed of sound determination [14]. High-throughput viscometers are advantageous for rapid property mapping across compositional and temperature spaces [13]. Rotational rheometers provide versatility for studying shear-dependent viscosity and other rheological behaviors [17]. Complementary techniques like dynamic light scattering (DLS) and differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) are used to measure diffusion coefficients of solutes within DESs [18], providing further insights into molecular transport. PFG-NMR also serves as a powerful tool for measuring self-diffusion coefficients of individual components or solutes [16]. The choice of method depends on the specific property of interest, required accuracy, sample volume, and experimental throughput needs.​  

# 3.3 Phase Equilibrium Properties  

Accurate determination of phase equilibrium properties is critical for understanding and predicting the behavior of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DES) in various applications. These properties, including vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE), solid–liquid equilibrium (SLE), liquid–liquid equilibrium (LLE), and solubility, govern separation processes, reaction design, and material formulation involving DES [32]. Measuring these properties in DES systems presents unique challenges, notably due to their often high viscosity and potential thermal instability at elevated temperatures, which can complicate experimental procedures and data interpretation [32].​  

Several experimental techniques are employed to probe the phase behavior of DES. For instance, VLE can be investigated indirectly through the determination of activity coefficients. Gas–liquid chromatography (GLC) is utilized to determine activity coefficients at infinite dilution, values which are fundamentally related to VLE [5]. While direct VLE measurements provide comprehensive data across composition ranges, estimating VLE from more readily accessible SLE data has also been explored [1].​  

SLE is another fundamental phase property extensively studied for DES systems, given their nature as eutectic mixtures formed from solid components. SLE data have been measured for various binary systems relevant to DES formation, such as choline chloride/resorcinol and nicotinamide/glutaric acid [39]. Similarly, SLE data for systems like sorbitol–water and choline chloride–water have been reported [1]. Techniques such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) are commonly employed to determine SLE data by identifying melting and crystallization points [1]. The calorimetric effect and thermokinetics associated with the formation of DES can also be measured [16], providing insights into the enthalpy changes accompanying the solid–liquid transition at the eutectic point.​  

Beyond binary systems, phase behavior in multicomponent systems involving DES components or DES interacting with other substances is crucial. Studies have elucidated complex phase behavior, such as identifying heterogeneous mixtures comprising ternary eutectic molten phases alongside solid phases during reactions [38]. Tracking the quantitative changes in the amounts of these phases throughout a process provides critical information for understanding reaction mechanisms and designing efficient processes [38].  

The experimental data from these techniques are essential for constructing phase diagrams, which graphically represent the regions of stability for different phases as a function of variables like temperature, pressure, and composition. While specific methods for constructing these diagrams were not detailed in the provided literature, the determination of SLE and VLE data directly contributes to their construction [1,39]. Furthermore, determining solubility parameters is an important aspect of understanding the interactions within DES and with solutes, although specific techniques for their determination were not covered in the analyzed texts. Overall, the characterization of phase equilibrium properties through varied experimental techniques is indispensable for advancing the understanding and application of DES, despite the inherent experimental challenges posed by their physical characteristics.​

Given the diverse compositions and complex interactions inherent in DESs, a wide array of modeling approaches has been developed, each with its distinct theoretical basis, applicability range, and computational requirements. These approaches can broadly be categorized into several main groups: empirical/correlation models, classical thermodynamic models (including activity coefficient models and equations of state), molecular simulation methods, quantum chemical methods coupled with predictive models, and data-driven machine learning techniques. The selection of an appropriate modeling approach is typically guided by factors such as the specific thermodynamic property of interest, the desired level of accuracy, the availability and quality of experimental data, and the computational resources available.  

Empirical and correlation models represent the most straightforward approach, relying on fitting experimental data to mathematical functions to describe property dependencies. These models, such as the Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann (VFT) equation for viscosity or polynomial regressions for process optimization, are computationally efficient and effective for correlating data within the range of experimental conditions used for parameterization [13,28]. However, their primary limitation is poor predictive capability when extrapolated beyond the training data, and they offer limited physical insight into the underlying molecular interactions.  

Classical thermodynamic models, including activity coefficient models and equations of state (EoS), aim to describe the non-ideal behavior and phase equilibria of DES systems based on thermodynamic principles. Activity coefficient models, such as the Non-Random Two-Liquid (NRTL) and extended NRTL (e–NRTL) models, are widely used to quantify deviations from ideal solution behavior and predict phase equilibria by capturing intercomponent interactions through adjustable parameters typically regressed from experimental data [1,27,39]. EoS models, including both classical cubic equations and more complex Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) variants like PC-SAFT, are employed to correlate and predict volumetric properties and phase behavior, particularly useful for capturing association phenomena like hydrogen bonding [24,27]. While powerful, the application of these models to DESs often requires accurate system-specific interaction parameters, which can be challenging to obtain.  

Molecular simulation methods, such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, provide molecularlevel insights into DES behavior. These techniques simulate the interactions and movements of individual molecules based on defined force fields, enabling the prediction of structural, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties like density and heat capacity [20,27]. MD simulations, for instance, integrate Newton's equations of motion for atoms, where the forces are derived from the potential energy calculated via a force field [20]. While offering detailed microscopic information, molecular simulations are computationally intensive, especially for large systems or long timescales, and their accuracy is heavily dependent on the quality and transferability of the force fields used.​  

Quantum chemical methods investigate the electronic structure and interactions at a fundamental level. Approaches like Density Functional Theory (DFT) are invaluable for characterizing specific interactions, particularly hydrogen bonding, within small DES clusters or pairs [6,31]. The outputs of these calculations, such as optimized geometries and vibrational frequencies, can be used to compute fundamental thermodynamic properties under ideal gas assumptions using tools like Shermo [25]. Building upon quantum chemistry, predictive models like COSMO-RS and COSMO-SAC utilize molecular surface charge distributions ( $\sigma$ -profiles) derived from quantum calculations to estimate activity coefficients and predict macroscopic properties like solubility and separation performance with minimal or no experimental data [3,10,12]. These methods are particularly useful for high-throughput screening, although their accuracy is linked to the initial quantum calculations and the simplifications inherent in the statistical thermodynamic framework.​  

Finally, machine learning (ML) approaches leverage data-driven techniques to build predictive models for DES properties. ML algorithms, including Gaussian Processes (GPs), Neural Networks (ANN/MLP), and others, can identify complex relationships within experimental or computational data, serving as computationally inexpensive proxy models [4,11,13]. ML has been applied to predict properties like heat capacity and viscosity and to accelerate DES discovery for specific applications [4,13,41]. Effective feature engineering, potentially using descriptors derived from quantum chemistry or COSMO-RS, is crucial for ML model performance [4]. Data scarcity is a significant challenge for ML, which can be partially addressed by strategies like active learning that intelligently guide experimental design [13].  

In summary, the landscape of modeling DES thermodynamic properties is diverse, ranging from simple empirical fits to complex molecular simulations and data-driven ML approaches. The choice among these methods depends critically on the property being studied, the required accuracy, data availability, and computational resources, often involving a trade-off between computational cost, physical rigor, and predictive capability.  

# 4.1 Empirical and Correlation Models  

Empirical and correlation models represent a straightforward approach to describing the thermodynamic properties of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) by establishing relationships based on experimental data fitting. These models are valued for their relative simplicity and computational efficiency, making them practical for correlating observed behaviors within specific experimental conditions. A prominent example is the application of the Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann (VFT) equation to model the temperature dependence of viscosity, expressed as   
\​   
where $\harpoonright$ is the viscosity, $\left. { \left( { \mathsf { T } } \right\backslash } \right)$ is the temperature, and $\backslash ( \backslash \mathsf { e t a \_ o } \backslash ) , \backslash ( \mathsf { B } \backslash )$ , and $\backslash ( \mathsf { T } _ { - } \circ \backslash )$ are empirical fitting parameters [13]. Such equations are typically fitted to experimental data using techniques like nonlinear least-squares analysis [13]. Similarly, empirical relationships are employed to describe other properties. The Redlich-Meyer equation, given by \​   
for apparent molar volume $( \backslash ( \mathsf { V _ { - } } \backslash \mathsf { p h i } \backslash ) )$ and​   
\​   
for apparent molar isentropic compressibility $( \backslash ( \backslash \mathsf { k a p p a \_ t p h i } ) )$ ), where $\left\backslash \left( \mathsf { m } \right\backslash \right)$ is molality and $\backslash ( \mathsf { V \_ w a r p h i } \land 0 \backslash ) , \backslash$   
$( \backslash \mathsf { k a p p a \_ w a r p h i } \land 0 \backslash ) , \backslash ( \mathsf { B \_ v } \backslash ) , \backslash ( \mathsf { B \_ } \backslash \mathsf { k a p p a } \backslash )$ are empirical parameters, has been used to correlate these volumetric and compressibility properties [14].   
Correlation models are also utilized in process optimization; for instance, a second-order polynomial regression equation   
derived from response surface methodology (RSM) can model the polyphenol extraction rate from Ginkgo leaves as a   
function of variables like ultrasonic time, liquid-solid ratio, and water volume fraction in the DES. An example is​   
\​   
which is effective for optimizing conditions and predicting outcomes within the domain covered by the experimental design   
[28].​   
Furthermore, empirical functions can describe other property dependencies, such as fitting experimental critical   
micellization temperatures (CMT) as a function of solute concentration using an exponential form:​   
\​  

or considering simple compositional dependencies like mole fraction for phase behavior modeling [7,17].  

These models demonstrate effectiveness in correlating experimental data accurately within the specific temperature, concentration, and composition ranges used for their parameterization [13,14,28]. They are valuable for summarizing experimental trends and enabling tasks such as process optimization or interpolation within the studied domain [28].  

However, the primary limitation of empirical and correlation models lies in their constrained predictive capability. Since the parameters are derived solely from fitting experimental data, these models typically lack accuracy when extrapolated outside the range of conditions used for their development. Furthermore, a significant drawback is their limited physical insight; the fitting parameters generally do not have direct physical meaning related to the underlying molecular interactions, hydrogen bonding networks, or structural characteristics of the DES. While more complex data-driven approaches—such as XGBoost-based models combined with SHapley Additive exPlanation—can offer deeper insights into feature importance for properties like viscosity [16], basic empirical and correlation models primarily serve as mathematical tools for data representation rather than providing a fundamental understanding of the system's thermodynamic behavior.​  

# 4.2 Activity Coefficient Models  

Activity coefficient models are fundamental tools for describing the non-ideal behavior of components in liquid mixtures,   
which is crucial for predicting phase equilibria and other thermodynamic properties of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs). The   
activity coefficient $\left( \backslash ( \backslash { \tt g a m m a \_ i } ) \right)$ ) of component \(i\) quantifies its deviation from ideal Raoult’s law behavior, often   
related to vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE) via the expression   
\​   
where $\backslash ( \mathsf { p \_ i } ) \$ is the partial pressure, \(P_i^{\text{sat}}\) is the pure component saturation pressure, and $\backslash ( \times \_ { \mathsf { i } } \backslash )$ is the mole   
fraction in the liquid phase [27]. These models aim to capture the complex molecular interactions responsible for non  
ideality.​   
Among the widely used empirical and semi-empirical activity coefficient models are the Non-Random Two-Liquid (NRTL)   
and extended Non-Random Two-Liquid (e–NRTL) models. The NRTL model calculates activity coefficients based on local   
composition concepts, postulating that the composition in the vicinity of a molecule is different from the bulk composition   
due to differences in interaction energy. The model’s equation for the activity coefficient of component $\left. { \langle { \bf \dot { \omega } } \rangle } \right.$ is given by   
\​   
where   
\​   
and​   
\​  

Here, $\backslash ( \times \_ { \mathsf { i } } \backslash )$ is the mole fraction, \(G_{ij}\) and \(\tau_{ij}\) are temperature-dependent NRTL parameters, \(\alpha\) is the nonrandomness parameter, and \(g_{ij}\) represents the interaction energy [39]. These parameters, particularly \(\tau_{ij}\), represent the binary interactions between components and are typically regressed from experimental data [39].  

Both NRTL and its extension, e–NRTL, have been applied to DES-containing systems. For instance, the e–NRTL model has been successfully utilized to correlate experimental solid–liquid equilibrium (SLE) data and subsequently predict the VLE behavior of aqueous systems containing choline chloride–based DESs [1]. Similarly, the NRTL model has been employed to correlate experimental vapor pressure and VLE data and predict phase diagrams for various absorbent–refrigerant systems, including those potentially relevant to DES applications [27]. The ability of these models to correlate diverse experimental data and predict phase behavior highlights their utility, but their performance is heavily reliant on accurate adjustable interaction parameters derived from experiments [1,27].​  

In contrast to empirical or semi-empirical models requiring experimental parameter fitting, predictive models like COSMO– SAC offer an alternative approach based on quantum mechanical calculations. COSMO–SAC uses the Conductor-like Screening Model (COSMO) to calculate the charge distribution on the surface of molecules. These charge distributions are then converted into a distribution of screening charges (the \(\sigma\)–profile). The interaction energies between different molecular surfaces are calculated using statistical mechanics (SAC), allowing for the estimation of activity coefficients [12]. This method employs fewer universal parameters compared to group contribution methods like UNIFAC, which relies on a large number of adjustable group interaction parameters and can have limited applicability [12]. A significant advantage of COSMO–SAC is its ability to estimate activity coefficients solely based on molecular structure, making it particularly valuable for systems where experimental data are limited or difficult to obtain [12].  

A key challenge in applying activity coefficient models like NRTL and e–NRTL to DES systems lies in obtaining accurate binary interaction parameters. These parameters are system–specific and must be determined by fitting the model to experimental thermodynamic data, such as VLE, SLE, or excess enthalpy data [1,27]. The accuracy of the model’s predictions for phase behavior and activity coefficients is highly sensitive to the quality and precision of these parameters [1,27]. For novel DES compositions or conditions lacking experimental data, parameter estimation becomes a significant hurdle, underscoring the potential benefits of predictive methods like COSMO–SAC in such scenarios.​  

# 4.3 Equation of State (EoS) Models  

Equation of State (EoS) models represent a class of thermodynamic frameworks widely employed to correlate and predict the volumetric properties and phase equilibria of fluid systems. Their application to complex fluids, such as Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs), presents both opportunities and challenges. Historically, cubic EoS—such as the Peng-Robinson or SoaveRedlich-Kwong equations—have been used due to their relative simplicity. While general cubic EoS have been further explored, including modifications like adding repulsion terms [34] or optimizing existing forms [34], their effectiveness in accurately capturing the intricate molecular interactions characteristic of DESs is often limited. These limitations typically arise from the simplified representation of molecular forces and the inherent difficulty in modeling strong, directional interactions—such as hydrogen bonding—without resorting to complex, multi-parameter mixing rules.  

To address these challenges, more physically based EoS models, particularly those belonging to the Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) family, have emerged as promising alternatives. SAFT-type models explicitly account for a range of molecular interactions, including Lennard-Jones dispersion/repulsion, chain formation, and, crucially, association (hydrogen bonding), making them potentially more suitable for accurately describing the behavior of highly non-ideal systems like DESs. For instance, the Perturbed-Chain SAFT (PC-SAFT) model is a physically based approach that has been successfully applied to model the properties of mixtures [27] and, more specifically, to predict the solubility of gases such as $C O _ { 2 }$ ​ in DES systems [24]. This application demonstrates the capability of PC-SAFT to forecast important phase equilibrium properties like gas solubility, which is vital for applications such as gas capture.​  

The performance of different EoS models for DESs varies depending on the specific composition of the DES and the property under investigation. While cubic EoS might offer a reasonable first approximation for some volumetric properties, SAFT-type models like PC-SAFT are better equipped to capture the nuances introduced by hydrogen bonding and other specific interactions that govern DES behavior. However, applying complex EoS models to DESs is not without its difficulties. A significant challenge lies in the accurate estimation of the numerous adjustable parameters required by these models. These parameters—which relate to molecular characteristics such as segment diameter, dispersion energy, chain length, and association energy/volume—often need to be fitted to experimental data for each specific DES component or mixture, a process that can be both data-intensive and computationally demanding. Despite these challenges, the physically based nature of SAFT-type EoS and their explicit accounting for association phenomena render them a powerful tool for modeling key thermodynamic properties of DESs, including density, vapor pressure, and solubility, provided that reliable parameter sets are available.  

# 4.4 Molecular Simulation Methods  

Molecular simulation methods, such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, are powerful tools for gaining molecular-level insights into the complex behavior of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs). These techniques allow researchers to simulate the interactions and movements of atoms and molecules over time or in different configurations, providing a microscopic view that complements experimental observations and helps predict macroscopic properties. In molecular dynamics, the system evolves by integrating Newton's equations of motion for each atom [20]. The acceleration of each atom i is determined by the total force acting upon it, as described by the equation:​  

$$
a _ { i } = \frac { d ^ { 2 } r _ { i } } { d t ^ { 2 } } = \frac { F _ { i } + f _ { i } } { m _ { i } }
$$  

where $\mathsf { \backslash } ( \mathsf { m \_ i } )$ is the mass, $\mathsf { \backslash } ( \mathsf { r } _ { - } \mathsf { i } \backslash )$ is the position vector, $\backslash ( \mathsf { F \_ i } )$ is the force from the potential field, and \(f_i\) represents other forces. The force $\backslash ( F \_ { \mathsf { i } } \backslash )$ is derived from the gradient of the potential function $\left\backslash ( \mathsf { U } \backslash ) \right.$ , specifically  

$$
F _ { i } = - \nabla _ { i } U
$$  

[20].​  

A critical aspect for the accuracy of molecular simulations, particularly for complex systems like DESs with their intricate hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, is the selection and development of appropriate force fields [20,31]. Force fields are mathematical functions and associated parameter sets used to calculate the potential energy of a system based on the positions of its atoms. This potential energy dictates the forces between particles. Various models exist, such as the Embedded-Atom Method (EAM), a semi-theoretical many-body potential model often used for metals, which partitions the total potential energy into interaction terms and embedding energy terms [20]. The total potential energy in such a model can be expressed as:​  

$$
U = \sum _ { i } F _ { i } ( \rho _ { h , i } ) + \frac { 1 } { 2 } \sum _ { i \neq j } \varphi _ { i j } ( R _ { i j } )
$$  

where $\backslash ( \mathsf { F \_ i } )$ is the embedding energy, $\langle ( { \mathsf { I r h o \_ } } \{ \mathsf { h } , \mathsf { i } \} \backslash )$ is the electron density at atom $\left. { \bf \dot { \left. i \right. } } \right.$ due to other atoms, and \ (\varphi_{ij}\) is a pair potential function, which could be based on models like the Johnson potential for specific material types [20]. The choice of force field directly impacts the simulation's ability to accurately represent the nuanced intermolecular interactions in DESs.​  

Molecular simulations offer significant strengths in predicting various properties of DESs. They can effectively model intermolecular forces [27] and predict thermodynamic properties such as density and heat capacity [9,27]. Beyond thermodynamics, MD simulations are particularly well-suited for probing dynamic and structural features. They can provide insights into kinetic properties and structural arrangements [33], visualize structure-activity relationships in processes like separation [3], and analyze dynamic behavior through metrics like the Lindemann index, which quantifies root-meansquared bond length fluctuations and can indicate mobility [20]. Specific applications studied using MD include understanding the stability of biocatalysts in DESs, such as lipases in urea:ChCl mixtures, where simulations confirmed excellent conformational stability [32]. MD has also been employed to investigate mechanisms like DES-mediated delignification [41].​  

Despite their capabilities, molecular simulations face limitations. Computational cost is a significant factor, particularly for large systems or long simulation times required to obtain accurate statistics and capture slow dynamic processes relevant to transport properties. Developing accurate and transferable force fields for the diverse range of components used to form new DESs remains a considerable challenge. These limitations necessitate careful consideration of simulation setup and computational resources. Ultimately, the validity and reliability of simulation results must be established through rigorous comparison with experimental data. Integrating simulation predictions with experimental measurements is crucial for refining models and ensuring their applicability to real-world DES systems.​  

# 4.5 Quantum Chemical Methods  

Quantum chemical calculations offer a fundamental approach to investigate the electronic structure and interactions within Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) at a molecular level [6]. These methods are particularly valuable for providing a detailed understanding of intricate intermolecular forces, most notably hydrogen bonding, which plays a defining role in the formation and unique properties of DESs. Studies employing quantum chemistry have characterized hydrogen bond interactions and strengths in various DES systems, including choline chloride–polyol mixtures [6] and those based on butanediol [31]. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a frequently used approach for investigating interactions within specific  

DES pairs or clusters, such as the interactions between choline chloride (ChCl) and protic components like butanediol or PB [30,31]. Beyond static calculations on small clusters, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, such as those performed using the CP2K package with functionals like PBE-D3, enable the exploration of structural and dynamic properties over short timescales, providing insights into molecular motion and hydrogen bond networks in a more realistic environment [31]. Quantum chemical calculations are also employed to identify and characterize other important interactions, such as halogen bonds and ion-pairs, in solutions relevant to DES research [33].​  

Furthermore, quantum chemical calculations serve as a powerful complement to experimental spectroscopic techniques. By simulating the vibrational modes or electronic transitions of DES components or clusters, theoretical calculations can aid in the interpretation of experimental spectra, providing molecular-level insights that reinforce spectroscopic observations of intermolecular interactions [6,33]. Research groups have utilized these computational methods to complement spectroscopic studies of mixtures pertinent to DESs, including systems like $Z \mathsf { n C l } _ { 2 }$ ​ -ethanol and ionic liquid solutions [33].  

The results obtained from quantum chemical calculations, specifically optimized molecular geometries and vibrational frequencies derived from frequency analysis, are critical inputs for computing various thermodynamic properties. Programs like Shermo can utilize output files from a range of quantum chemistry software (including Gaussian, ORCA, and others) to calculate common thermochemistry quantities such as internal energy $( U )$ , enthalpy $( H )$ , entropy $( S )$ , constant volume heat capacity $( C _ { v } )$ , constant pressure heat capacity $( C _ { p } )$ , and the partition function $( \boldsymbol { q } )$ [25]. Shermo provides detailed contributions from translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic degrees of freedom, allowing for a deeper understanding of the factors influencing these properties [25]. Similarly, tools like Molclus assist in preparing input and processing output for quantum chemistry programs, facilitating the workflow for obtaining high-accuracy thermodynamic data [9].​  

While quantum chemical methods provide highly accurate descriptions of electronic structure and interactions, their application to large systems is limited by high computational cost. Calculating the properties of bulk DESs containing thousands of atoms over relevant timescales remains computationally prohibitive. However, the precise insights gained from quantum chemistry on small DES clusters or pairs, particularly regarding interaction energies and charge distributions, are invaluable for informing the development and parameterization of force fields used in more computationally tractable classical simulation methods like molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo.​  

# 4.6 COSMO-RS and other Predictive Models  

Predictive models play a crucial role in understanding and forecasting the thermodynamic properties of deep eutectic solvents (DESs), enabling efficient screening and design for various applications. Among these, the Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS) is a widely employed approach.  

![](images/0db742858a05f9f3277368b15d852e8e43cd538ebaf996a07bf423f351ff7532.jpg)  

The principles of COSMO-RS are rooted in quantum chemical calculations, specifically those derived from the Conductorlike Screening Model (COSMO) [12]. This initial step involves calculating the electrostatic surface charge distribution of individual molecules in a virtual perfect conductor environment. The resulting information is condensed into molecular descriptors known as sigma profiles ( $\sigma$ -profiles), which represent the probability distribution of surface charge densities on the molecule's surface [12]. A detailed approach to generating these sigma profiles and post-processing COSMO calculation results for property evaluation has been documented [12].  

These $\sigma$ -profiles, capturing essential information about molecular interactions, are then utilized in statistical thermodynamic models, such as COSMO-SAC, to predict macroscopic thermodynamic properties. These models employ the concept of segment interactions based on the surface charge densities described by the $\sigma$ -profiles to calculate properties like activity coefficients and solubility in complex mixtures, including DESs.  

A significant strength of COSMO-RS lies in its capability to estimate thermodynamic properties for numerous molecular combinations with limited or no experimental data. This predictive power is particularly valuable for the high-throughput screening of potential DES candidates for specific applications. For instance, COSMO-RS has been successfully applied to design hydrophobic DESs for pre-combustion CO2 capture, allowing for the screening of CO2 solubility in various compounds [3]. It has also been used to predict the selectivity, capacity, and performance indices of terpenoid DESs for the extraction of antibiotics and dyes, identifying promising candidates such as thymol-benzyl alcohol [3]. Furthermore, the COSMO-SAC model, derived from COSMO-RS, has been employed to predict the separation performance of DESs for phenolic compounds and to determine optimal liquid phase operation windows based on solid-liquid phase diagrams [3]. Screening 40 different DESs for separating mixtures like m-cresol and cumene has also been performed using the COSMO-RS model [10]. COSMO-RS has also contributed to studies exploring the synergy between natural products and DESs, such as garlic extract with DESs as potential antibiotics [44].​  

Despite its utility, COSMO-RS has limitations. Its accuracy is inherently dependent on the quality of the initial quantum chemical calculations, which can be computationally intensive and sensitive to the chosen functional and basis set. Moreover, the model simplifies the treatment of specific interactions, such as strong hydrogen bonding prevalent in DESs, which can sometimes lead to deviations from experimental results.  

Beyond direct property prediction, COSMO-RS descriptors can serve as valuable inputs for other predictive modeling approaches, particularly machine learning (ML). By using $\sigma$ -profiles and other descriptors calculated from quantum chemical methods, ML models can capture detailed structural and interaction information about the DES components [4]. This hybrid approach leverages the physical insights from COSMO-RS within data-driven ML frameworks to predict properties like the heat capacity of DESs [4]. The application of COSMO-RS has also been combined with other simulation techniques, such as Molecular Dynamics, to predict properties like density, heat capacity, and Henry's coefficients in systems like refrigerant-absorbent mixtures [27].  

# 4.7 Machine Learning Approaches  

Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for modeling and predicting the thermodynamic properties of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs). This approach offers significant advantages over traditional physics-based models, primarily through its capacity to identify complex, non-linear relationships within data and its potential to substantially accelerate the prediction process [4,13]. ML models can serve as computationally inexpensive proxy models, leading to a significant reduction in execution time compared to traditional simulation techniques [11]. Beyond property prediction, ML accelerates the discovery of DESs for various applications, including the recycling of Lithium-ion battery cathodes [16], screening components for absorption refrigeration systems at the atomic scale [34], and predicting outcomes in DES pretreatment processes such as delignification and lignin structure regulation [41]. ML has also been applied to predict the solubility of nanodrugs in DESs via green chemistry routes [44].​  

Diverse ML algorithms have been explored for predicting DES properties. One study investigated the performance of _k_- Nearest Neighbors (_k_NN), Random Forests (RF), Neural Network Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) for predicting DES heat capacity [4]. Hyperparameter optimization was applied to fine-tune each model. Among these, the MLP model demonstrated superior performance, achieving Average Absolute Relative Deviation (AARD) values of $0 . 5 0 0 \%$ and $3 . 9 9 9 \%$ for the training and test sets, respectively [4]. In a different approach, Gaussian Processes (GPs) were successfully employed to model DES viscosity $( \eta )$ as a function of composition (mole fractions, $\boldsymbol { x } _ { i }$ ) and temperature $( T )$ [13]. The GP model constructs a surrogate function  

$$
\eta ^ { \prime } ( \mathbf { X } ) \sim \mathcal { G P } ( m ( \mathbf { X } ) , k ( \mathbf { X } ) ) ,
$$  

where $\mathbf { x }$ is the feature vector [13]. Various covariance functions, including the radial basis function (RBF) kernel and the rational quadratic (RQ) kernel, were evaluated:  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { R B F ( { \mathbf { X } } _ { i } , { \mathbf { X } } _ { j } ) } = \sigma ^ { 2 } \exp \left( - \frac { | | { \mathbf { X } } _ { i } - { \mathbf { X } } _ { j } | | ^ { 2 } } { 2 l ^ { 2 } } \right) } \\ { { R Q ( { \mathbf { X } } _ { i } , { \mathbf { X } } _ { j } ) } = \sigma ^ { 2 } \left( 1 + \frac { | | { \mathbf { X } } _ { i } - { \mathbf { X } } _ { j } | | ^ { 2 } } { 2 \alpha l ^ { 2 } } \right) ^ { - \alpha } } \end{array}
$$  

A white noise kernel $( W )$ was included to account for experimental uncertainty [13]:  

$$
W = k ( \mathbf { X } _ { i } , \mathbf { X } _ { j } ) = \delta ( i , j ) \sigma ^ { 2 } .
$$  

The predictive capability of the GP model allows for estimating new viscosity data points with associated uncertainty: $\eta _ { i } ^ { \prime } | \eta \sim \mathcal { N } ( \mu ^ { \prime } , \Sigma ^ { \prime } )$  

where the predicted mean $\mu ^ { \prime }$ and variance $\Sigma ^ { \prime }$ are given by:  

$$
\begin{array} { l } { { \mu ^ { \prime } = \Sigma _ { \eta , \eta _ { i } ^ { \prime } } ^ { T } \Sigma _ { \eta , \eta } ^ { - 1 } \eta } } \\ { { \Sigma ^ { \prime } = \Sigma _ { \eta _ { i } ^ { \prime } , \eta _ { i } ^ { \prime } } - \Sigma _ { \eta , \eta _ { i } ^ { \prime } } ^ { T } \Sigma _ { \eta , \eta } ^ { - 1 } \Sigma _ { \eta , \eta _ { i } ^ { \prime } } } } \end{array}
$$  

These calculations were facilitated by libraries such as GPFlow and TensorFlow [13]. The impact of data preparation on predictive accuracy is crucial, with normalization schemes like min-max scaling, standardization, and log-standardization commonly applied to features and labels:​  

$\begin{array} { l } { y ^ { \prime } = \cfrac { y - y _ { m i n } } { y _ { m a x } - y _ { m i n } } } \\ { y ^ { \prime } = \cfrac { y - \langle y \rangle } { s _ { y } } } \\ { y ^ { \prime } = \cfrac { \ln ( y ) - \langle \ln ( y ) \rangle } { s _ { \ln ( y ) } } } \end{array}$ [13]. Effective feature engineering and the quality of the input data are paramount for building accurate predictive models.  

Interpreting the decisions of complex ML models is vital for gaining scientific insights. Techniques such as SHAP (Shapley Additive explanations) analysis are employed to understand the contribution of specific molecular or structural features of DES components to the predicted property [4]. SHAP analysis can identify the most influential factors governing properties like heat capacity, offering valuable guidance for rational DES design [4].​  

Despite their promise, ML approaches face limitations. They are data-hungry, requiring large volumes of high-quality experimental or computational data for training, and are susceptible to overfitting, particularly when datasets are small or features are not well-curated. Data scarcity is a significant challenge in the context of novel materials like DESs. Strategies such as active learning can mitigate this issue [13]. Active learning integrates experimental design with ML model predictions and uncertainties to intelligently select the most informative data points for subsequent experiments, thereby optimizing data acquisition and model refinement cycles [13]. By iteratively exploring the chemical space based on model uncertainty, active learning can significantly reduce the experimental effort required to build robust predictive models.​

The successful design, optimization, and scaling of DES-based processes are critically dependent on a thorough understanding and accurate prediction of their thermodynamic properties and phase behavior. Thermodynamic modeling plays a crucial role in elucidating the complex intermolecular interactions governing DES behavior, predicting system properties under various conditions, and guiding the rational selection and formulation of DESs for specific applications. This section illustrates the significant impact of thermodynamic modeling across diverse application areas, detailing why specific thermodynamic properties are important and how modeling contributes to optimizing process outcomes.  

In extraction and separation processes, DESs are utilized for selective dissolution, absorption, and partitioning of target solutes from complex mixtures, leveraging their tunable properties and strong hydrogen bonding capabilities [2]. Key thermodynamic properties are solute solubility, activity coefficients, and phase equilibria, which dictate partitioning behavior and selectivity [2,5]. Accurate prediction of these properties through thermodynamic modeling is essential for designing efficient separation processes, such as the extraction of biomolecules, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, fuel denitrogenation/desulphurization, and metal separation [2,5,6,28,32,37]. While experimental optimization is common, predictive modeling is needed to transition from empirical methods to rational design, although specific details on the widespread application of predictive thermodynamic models for guiding DES selection in separation were not explicitly detailed in some provided digests.​  

For reaction engineering and catalysis, DESs serve as promising reaction media or catalysts, potentially enhancing yields, selectivity, and catalyst stability [32]. The efficiency and outcome of reactions in DESs are profoundly influenced by the solubility and activity of reactants, intermediates, and products within the solvent, as well as the phase behavior of the reaction mixture [38]. Important thermodynamic considerations include solvation thermodynamics, activity coefficients, and phase equilibria. Modeling these properties provides insight into the molecular interactions that affect reaction mechanisms and kinetics, enabling optimization of conditions for processes like enzymatic catalysis, oxidation  

desulfurization, synthesis of catalytic materials, and solvent-free carboxylation reactions [10,29,32,38]. A predictive understanding derived from thermodynamic modeling is crucial for rationally designing reaction systems in DESs.  

In pharmaceutical applications, DESs offer potential solutions for the poor solubility of many active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) [14]. The critical property is drug solubility, which is governed by intricate drug-DES interactions [14]. Thermodynamic modeling, including computational approaches like COSMO-RS and machine learning, is explored for predicting drug solubility and guiding the selection of optimal DES compositions for enhanced drug loading and formulation stability [14,44]. Experimental techniques complement modeling efforts by providing data on volumetric and compressibility properties to validate and refine models aimed at understanding and predicting solubility behavior [14].  

CO2 capture and utilization technologies benefit significantly from the application of DESs [3]. The key thermodynamic properties are the solubility of CO2 in the DES and the phase equilibria of $D E S + C O 2$ systems [2,3,24]. Thermodynamic models such as PC-SAFT and COSMO-RS are employed to predict CO2 solubility across varying conditions and to screen potential DES candidates for efficient capture [3,24]. Understanding phase behavior is also critical for designing the energyefficient regeneration step in capture processes and for optimizing solvent-free utilization reactions where the eutectic phase is the reaction medium [38].  

For biomass conversion, DESs are promising solvents for pretreatment and fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass [29,41]. The effectiveness is tied to the solubility and degradation mechanisms of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose, dictated by interactions between the DES components and biomass constituents [30,35]. Understanding how DES composition influences these interactions and the resulting solubility of biomass components is crucial for optimizing delignification and preserving cellulose [30,35]. While experimental studies demonstrate successful applications in wood chip fractionation, nanofiber production, and conversion of biomass-derived compounds [10,29,32,38,41], explicit details on thermodynamic modeling for predicting DES-biomass interactions to guide rational DES design were less commonly reported in some areas [34,42].​  

In the field of metal extraction and recycling, DESs offer environmentally friendlier alternatives for recovering metals from various sources [21]. The efficiency and selectivity depend on the solubility of metal species in the DES phase and their partitioning behavior [21]. Key properties are metal salt/oxide solubility and selective coordination abilities of DES components with specific metal ions [21]. Modeling solubility and partitioning is crucial for the rational design of taskspecific DESs for high-efficiency, selective metal recovery, as shown in applications for extracting metals like Zn, Pb, Fe, Co, and Ni [7,10,16,21]. However, the provided digests highlighted the potential for predictive modeling but lacked specific examples detailing how such models were directly applied to guide the design of DESs for metal recycling with optimized selectivity and capacity.​  

For electrochemistry and energy applications, DESs are explored as electrolytes and working fluids in devices like batteries, supercapacitors, redox flow batteries, and absorption refrigeration systems [19,22,27,29,31]. Crucial thermodynamic and transport properties include ionic conductivity, viscosity, electrochemical window, vapor pressure, heat capacity, and enthalpy of mixing [13,19,22,27,34]. Thermodynamic modeling helps predict ionic conductivity based on composition and temperature [13] and is indispensable for evaluating and optimizing working fluid pairs in absorption cycles by modeling properties like vapor pressure and enthalpy [27]. Modeling also contributes to simulating system performance in applications like redox flow batteries [22] and assessing potential in thermal energy storage [43].  

Finally, understanding DES behavior under confinement and at interfaces is vital for applications involving porous materials, thin films, and heterogeneous catalysis [18,19]. Confinement significantly alters transport properties like diffusion, viscosity, and conductivity, as well as local solvation and structure due to restricted movement and surface interactions [18,19]. At solid–liquid interfaces, ion adsorption, layering, and electric double layer structure are critical, particularly in electrochemical systems [19]. Modeling is needed to predict these altered properties and complex interfacial phenomena, although the provided digests highlighted experimental studies using techniques like CLiC, STM, and AFM to probe these effects [18,19], indicating a significant need for robust theoretical frameworks and modeling approaches specific to confined and interfacial DES systems.​  

In summary, thermodynamic modeling is a vital tool across the diverse applications of DESs. Predicting properties such as solubility, activity coefficients, phase equilibria, viscosity, and thermal properties is essential for rational design and optimization in separation, reaction engineering, pharmaceuticals, CO2 technologies, biomass processing, metal recycling, and energy systems [3,5,13,14,24,27]. While significant progress has been made in applying modeling to specific areas, the digests highlight a general need for developing more accurate and predictive models applicable to the vast chemical space of DESs and complex multi-component systems, especially for guiding the rational design of DESs with tailored properties for challenging applications like selective metal extraction or understanding behavior under confinement. Future research focusing on integrating experimental data with advanced modeling techniques will be key to unlocking the full potential of DESs in these critical technological areas.  

# 5.1 Extraction and Separation Processes  

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as versatile and efficient media for a wide array of extraction and separation processes across various fields, including chemical, environmental, and food industries. Their tunable physical and chemical properties, particularly their ability to engage in strong hydrogen bond interactions, enable selective dissolution, absorption, and partitioning of target solutes from complex mixtures [2].  

The application of DESs in separation can generally be categorized into two main approaches [2]. In the first approach, a DES is pre-synthesized and utilized as a solvent to selectively dissolve or absorb specific components from a mixture. This functions akin to conventional solvent extraction, leveraging the intrinsic affinity of the DES for the target solute. An example is the absorption of $S O _ { 2 }$ ​ using a betaine $^ +$ ethylene glycol DES [2]. The second approach involves the _in situ_ formation of a DES within the separation system. This typically occurs by adding a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) to a mixture containing one or more hydrogen bond donors (HBDs). If a DES forms between the HBA and a specific HBD component of the mixture, and this newly formed DES phase is immiscible with the remaining components, separation is achieved. The removal of phenol from an oil mixture using choline chloride as the HBA illustrates this principle, where a phenol $^ +$ choline chloride DES forms _in situ_ and phase separates from the oil [2].  

The efficacy of DESs in separation hinges on their ability to facilitate selective partitioning of solutes between phases. This has been demonstrated in numerous applications, including the extraction of biomolecules such as proteins (e.g., bovine serum albumin, trypsin, soy protein) and nucleic acids (salmon testis DNA) using DES-based aqueous biphasic systems (ABSs) [32,37]. Phenolic compounds, amino acids (l-tryptophan, l-phenylalanine, l-tyrosine), alkaloids (caffeine, nicotine), gallic acid, and vanillic acid have also been effectively extracted using various DES formulations [32]. Beyond biomolecules, DESs have been applied to the purification of bioactive compounds, biodiesel, and flavonoids [6], fractionation of wood chips [29], extraction of specific components from food matrices like capsaicin from spicy foods with high recovery rates (above $7 5 \%$ ) [3], and critical industrial separations like the denitrogenation and desulphurization of transportation fuels [5,10]. Specific DESs composed of trioctylmethylammonium chloride and fatty alcohols have shown high efficiency in separating Co(II) and Ni(II) from aqueous solutions, achieving Co(II) stripping rates over $9 9 . 5 \%$ under optimized conditions involving chloride concentration, temperature, and acidity [10]. Similarly, a novel caprolactam-malonic acid DES exhibited a remarkable $9 7 . 7 \%$ removal rate for basic nitrogen from coking diesel, demonstrating selective extraction capabilities for fuel contaminants [10]. For the extraction of natural products, such as polyphenols from Ginkgo leaves, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) coupled with DESs has been successfully optimized by adjusting parameters including DES type, extraction time, liquid-solid ratio, and water content, leading to a polyphenol extraction rate of $1 3 . 7 3 \%$ [28].  

Optimizing DES-based extraction and separation processes necessitates a thorough understanding of the factors governing solute partitioning and selectivity. While experimental optimization using methodologies like Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is widely employed to determine optimal operating conditions [28,37], thermodynamic modeling is crucial for predicting the behavior of solutes in DES systems and guiding the selection of optimal DES composition and operating conditions [2,5,28]. Models capable of accurately predicting activity coefficients and phase equilibria in DEScontaining mixtures are essential for designing efficient separation processes. Such models can provide insights into the molecular interactions driving partitioning and selectivity, thereby reducing the need for extensive experimental screening. Although the provided digests detail numerous successful ap licationsand experimentaloptimizationsdemonstrating effective partitioning and high separation performance, they do not explicitly elaborate on the specific thermodynamic modelsused to predict solute partitioning, selectivity, or to guidethe selection of optimal DES formulations or operating conditions based on these predictions. This highlights a significant area where predictive modeling is needed to transition from empirical optimization to a more rational, model-guided design of DES-based separation processes. For instance, understanding activity coefficients can predict the favorability of a solute partitioning into the DES phase versus another phase, which is critical for predicting separation performance [5]. Future research focusing on developing and validating robust thermodynamic models for diverse DES-solute systems is vital for advancing the rational design and industrial application of DESs in separation technologies.​  

# 5.2 Reaction Engineering and Catalysis  

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as promising media for conducting a wide variety of chemical reactions, offering potential benefits over traditional organic solvents—such as enhanced yields, improved selectivity, increased catalyst stability, and ease of recycling [32]. Their application spans diverse catalytic processes. In enzymatic catalysis, for instance, DESs have been demonstrated to improve reaction yields, final product purity, enantioselectivity, enzyme stability, and facilitate enzyme recovery [32]. Notable examples include the significant increase in hydrolysis conversion of styrene oxide catalyzed by epoxide hydrolase when conducted in a choline chloride–glycerol DES, and successful lipase-catalyzed transesterification between glucose and vinyl hexanoate in choline chloride–urea DESs [32].  

Beyond biocatalysis, DESs and related eutectic systems serve effectively as reaction media or components in other catalytic applications. A ternary eutectic molten phase, acting as the reaction medium, has been shown to facilitate solvent-free carboxylation reactions—emphasizing that understanding the phase behavior is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions [38]. NHPI-based DESs, synthesized from N-hydroxyphthalimide, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and polyethylene glycol, have exhibited excellent catalytic oxidation desulfurization performance, achieving high desulfurization rates [10]. Furthermore, DESs have been utilized in the synthesis of catalytic materials, such as lignin-directed palladium nanoparticles for the removal of hexavalent chromium, and can act as green solvents or catalysts in the esterification of cellulose to produce cellulose nanofibers [29]. Electrocatalytic oxidation activity has also been explored in related green solvent contexts [16].  

The efficiency and outcome of reactions performed in DESs are critically dependent on the intricate interactions occurring within the solvent medium. A fundamental requirement for the rational optimization of reaction rate and yield is the accurate prediction and understanding of the solubility and activity of reactants, intermediates, and products within the DES environment. These properties are directly governed by the thermodynamic state and the specific interactions between the solute and the DES components.  

The unique physicochemical properties of DESs—including their polarity, acidity or basicity, viscosity, and pronounced hydrogen-bonding capability—significantly influence the reaction landscape. These properties dictate the solvation environment of the reacting species and can profoundly impact reaction mechanisms, kinetics, and equilibrium positions. Specific interactions, such as hydrogen bonding between DES components and transition states or key intermediates, can provide stabilization or destabilization effects that alter reaction pathways and energy barriers. While experimental studies demonstrate the practical benefits of using DESs in various reactions, a deeper, predictive understanding—necessary for rational design and optimization—often requires the application of thermodynamic models. Such models can elucidate the complex interplay between the DES composition, structure, and properties, and the behavior of dissolved species. By modeling solvation enthalpies, activity coefficients, and phase equilibria, researchers can gain critical insights into how the DES medium influences the molecular-level events of a reaction, moving towards a more predictive and less empirical approach to reaction engineering in these novel solvents. Understanding the phase behavior of the reaction mixture, for instance, has been highlighted as essential for optimizing processes occurring in eutectic molten phases [38].​  

# 5.3 Pharmaceutical Applications  

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) present a promising avenue for addressing the persistent challenge of poor solubility in many drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), a critical hurdle in pharmaceutical formulation. Thermodynamic modeling plays a vital role in predicting and understanding the solubility behavior of these compounds in DES systems [14]. The application of computational approaches, such as COSMO-RS and machine learning models, has been explored for predicting nanodrug solubility [44], demonstrating the potential of predictive modeling in optimizing drug formulations. Furthermore, COSMO-RS has been utilized in studying the synergy between garlic extract and DESs for potential antibiotic applications [44], highlighting the broader applicability of thermodynamic modeling in drug-related fields involving DESs.  

A key aspect of leveraging DESs for enhanced drug solubility lies in understanding the intricate drug–DES interactions. Experimental studies utilizing techniques like volumetric and compressibility properties can provide valuable insights into these interactions [14]. For instance, the solubilization of phenytoin (PTH) in DESs has been investigated, revealing that the interaction between PTH and the solvent components (such as ethanol in a ChCl:EG based system) increases with increasing DES molality and temperature [14]. Notably, stronger interactions were observed when using a ChCl:EG based DES compared to other systems studied [14]. These experimental observations are crucial for validating and refining thermodynamic models aimed at predicting solubility. Understanding specific molecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, is also fundamental. Research into the hydrogen bonding between lidocaine and ibuprofen (Lid $\cdot$ Ibu) has shown  

that such interactions can promote membrane transport, leading to faster and higher systemic absorption compared to commercial salt forms [15]. While this specific study focuses on transport rather than bulk solubility modeling, the investigation of hydrogen bonding is highly relevant as these interactions significantly influence solubility and are key parameters in molecular thermodynamic models.  

Thermodynamic modeling is instrumental in guiding the selection of optimal DES compositions for drug formulation. By accurately predicting solubility based on drug–solvent interactions, modeling can aid in identifying DES systems that maximize drug loading capacity [14]. Beyond simple solubility, modeling can also inform decisions regarding other critical properties like stability and viscosity, which are essential for developing viable pharmaceutical products. The ability to predict solubility under varying conditions, such as temperature and composition, allows researchers to computationally screen potential DES candidates, reducing the need for extensive experimental work. Furthermore, computational tools like Molclus, used for searching the lowest energy conformers of molecules like Remdesivir in relevant environments [9], provide foundational structural information essential for many thermodynamic modeling approaches. Therefore, thermodynamic modeling, supported by experimental characterization of interactions, is indispensable for the rational design and optimization of DES-based pharmaceutical formulations, particularly for enhancing the solubility and delivery of challenging APIs.​  

# 5.4 CO2 Capture and Utilization  

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as promising candidates for carbon dioxide $( \mathsf { C O } _ { 2 } )$ capture and utilization technologies due to their tunable properties, low cost, and environmental compatibility. Effective design and optimization of processes employing DESs for these applications necessitate a thorough understanding and accurate prediction of their thermodynamic behavior, particularly concerning $C O _ { 2 }$ solubility and phase equilibria in $D E S + C O _ { 2 }$ systems.  

Thermodynamic modeling plays a crucial role in predicting the solubility of $C O _ { 2 }$ in various DESs, which is a fundamental property for designing efficient capture systems [3,24]. Models such as the Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT) have been applied specifically for this purpose [24]. Such models allow for the prediction of $C O _ { 2 }$ solubility across a range of temperatures and pressures, providing valuable data that might be experimentally challenging or timeconsuming to obtain for a vast number of potential DES formulations. Beyond equation-of-state approaches like PC-SAFT, other thermodynamic screening methods, such as COSMO-RS, have been employed to evaluate and predict $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ solubility in DESs. This computational screening approach facilitates the identification of promising DES candidates for specific applications, such as pre-combustion $C O _ { 2 }$ capture. Using COSMO-RS, specific natural hydrophobic DESs like Vanillin-4- oxoisophorone (1:3) and methyl salicylate-4-oxoisophorone (1:1) have been identified as potentially effective $C O _ { 2 }$ capture agents [3].​  

Experimental studies provide critical data for validating and guiding the development of these thermodynamic models. For instance, research on the solubility of $C O _ { 2 }$ in choline chloride (ChCl) $^ +$ urea DESs demonstrated that $C O _ { 2 }$ absorption capacity is influenced by temperature, pressure (up to $\mathsf { 1 3 } \mathsf { M P a } ,$ ), and the molar ratio of components, with a ChCl:urea ratio of 1:2 exhibiting the highest absorption capacity within the studied range of $4 0 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ to $6 0 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ [2]. The observed minor enthalpies of absorption indicated the exothermic nature of this process.  

Furthermore, thermodynamic modeling is essential for predicting the phase behavior of $D E S + C O _ { 2 }$ systems beyond simple solubility. Understanding the vapor–liquid or liquid–liquid equilibria is critical for designing the regeneration step in $C O _ { 2 }$ capture processes, where captured $C O _ { 2 }$ is released from the DES for sequestration or utilization, and the DES is recovered for reuse. Predicting how temperature, pressure, and $C O _ { 2 }$ loading affect the phase state of the mixture allows for the optimization of regeneration conditions to minimize energy consumption.  

In addition to capture, DESs are increasingly explored as reaction media for $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ utilization. Their unique solvent properties and ability to stabilize reactive intermediates can facilitate chemical transformations that incorporate $\mathsf { C O } _ { 2 }$ into valuable products. An example of this application involves solvent-free carboxylation reactions, where the eutectic phase of the DES system plays a crucial role in enabling the reaction [38]. Understanding the phase behavior of the DES, reactants, and $C O _ { 2 }$ under reaction conditions is vital for optimizing reaction efficiency and product separation.  

In summary, thermodynamic modeling, employing techniques like PC-SAFT and COSMO-RS, is indispensable for predicting $C O _ { 2 }$ solubility and phase behavior in DESs, guiding the design of effective $C O _ { 2 }$ capture processes—particularly in selecting suitable DES compositions and optimizing absorption and regeneration steps. Concurrently, understanding DES phase behavior is critical when employing them as reaction media for $C O _ { 2 }$ utilization, enabling efficient solvent-free processes.  

# 5.5 Biomass Conversion  

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as promising solvents for the pretreatment and conversion of biomass, offering tunable properties for the efficient fractionation of lignocellulosic components such as lignin and cellulose [29,41]. The effectiveness of DESs in biomass processing is intricately linked to their unique properties, which are primarily governed by the complex network of intermolecular interactions between the hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) and hydrogen bond donor (HBD) components, as well as their interactions with the biomass constituents [30,35]. These interactions, including hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and electrostatic interactions, dictate the solubility and degradation mechanisms of lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose within the DES matrix, thereby influencing the overall fractionation efficiency and the characteristics of the resulting fractions.  

Tailoring the composition of the DES, specifically the choice of HBA and HBD and their molar ratio, provides a powerful means to optimize biomass pretreatment for desired outcomes [35]. For instance, the application of choline chloride–based DESs with varied HBDs demonstrates different degrees of delignification and effects on enzymatic hydrolysis [30]. A study utilizing choline chloride–phenolacetic acid (ChCl-PB) DES for poplar pretreatment achieved up to $6 9 \%$ delignification, leading to pretreated residues that yielded over $9 0 \%$ glucose after 72 hours of enzymatic hydrolysis [30]. The performance of ChCl-PB was also compared to other DESs containing $p$ -coumaric acid (PCA) and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (PHA) as HBDs, highlighting the impact of the specific HBD on pretreatment efficacy [30].  

Similarly, the use of choline chloride–ethylene glycol (ChCl/EG) DES for switchgrass fractionation demonstrated the ability to achieve significant lignin removal, exceeding $6 5 \%$ and reaching close to $9 0 \%$ within 30 minutes under optimized conditions [35]. This research underscores the potential for "finely tuning the solvent system" to achieve synchronized production of valuable biomass fractions, such as uncondensed lignin with appealing properties like high purity $( 9 1 . 4 \% )$ and well-preserved $\beta$ -O-4 linkages, alongside digestible pulp [35]. Alkaline DESs, such as choline chloride–ethanolamine and choline chloride–N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine (ChCl-CN-2), have been shown to effectively pretreat corn stover, significantly increasing polysaccharide content from $5 1 . 5 9 \%$ to $8 1 . 3 3 \% - 8 3 . 3 6 \%$ and achieving high lignin removal rates between $7 1 . 3 5 \%$ and $8 9 . 7 2 \%$ while minimizing polysaccharide degradation [10]. Furthermore, combining hydrothermal prehydrolysis with DES treatment has been explored for producing reed cellulose nanofibrils, demonstrating specific conditions ( $1 6 5 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ prehydrolysis temperature, 1g:6mL reed-to-DES ratio, 50 min holding time) that effectively reduce lignin and pentosan content while retaining cellulose [10].​  

The successful implementation and optimization of DES-based biomass conversion processes necessitate a deep understanding of the interactions occurring between the DES components and the complex biomass matrix. Understanding how the intermolecular forces within the DES affect its ability to disrupt the cell wall structure, solubilize lignin, and preserve cellulose is crucial for designing more efficient and selective processes [30,35]. This understanding is key to optimizing DES composition, temperature, time, and other process parameters. While experimental studies provide valuable insights into the outcomes of DES treatment, understanding and potentially modeling these interactions, for example, through solubility models or molecular simulations, is essential for rational DES design and process optimization [35]. Although some studies demonstrate the practical application of DESs in biomass conversion [10,29,41], explicit details on thermodynamic modeling approaches for predicting DES–biomass interactions are less commonly reported in certain research areas [34,42], highlighting a potential area for further research.​  

Beyond pretreatment, DESs also find application in other biomass conversion routes. For instance, metallic salts combined with choline chloride–citric acid DES have been used for the dehydration of xylose and xylan to furfural at $1 4 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ [32]. Additionally, DESs can facilitate reactions involving biomass–derived compounds, such as the conversion of lignocellulose– derived furoate into $\mathrm { F D C A } ^ { 2 - }$ , a precursor for performance–advantaged plastics [38]. These applications further underscore the versatility of DESs in the context of biomass valorization.  

# 5.6 Metal Extraction and Recycling  

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as promising environmentally friendlier alternatives to traditional organic solvents and aqueous methods for the extraction and recycling of critical metals from various sources, including complex minerals and secondary resources like spent batteries [21]. Their advantages include inherent low toxicity, biodegradability, cost-effectiveness, and the potential to significantly reduce or eliminate wastewater discharge associated with conventional metallurgical processes, particularly with the integration of non‐aqueous DESs [21].  

The efficiency and selectivity of metal extraction using DESs are fundamentally linked to the solubility of metal salts or oxides in the DES phase and the subsequent partitioning behavior of metal ions between the DES and other phases involved in the separation process [21]. DES components exhibit varying coordination abilities with different metal ions, enabling selective dissolution and separation [21]. For instance, a DES composed of choline chloride and urea (1:2 molar ratio) demonstrated selective dissolution of transition metal oxides at $6 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ [21]. This specific DES showed high solubility for zinc oxide $( 8 4 6 6 \mathrm { m g } \cdot \mathsf { L } ^ { - 1 }$ ) and lead oxide $( 9 1 5 7 \mathrm { m g } \cdot \mathsf { L } ^ { - 1 } ) _ { \tau } .$ ), while the solubility of ferric oxide was significantly lower $( 4 9 \mathrm { m g } \cdot \mathsf { L } ^ { - 1 } )$ [21]. Similarly, other DES formulations, such as those based on choline chloride and carboxylic acids, have been recognized as effective solvents for metal oxides, suggesting their potential utility in metal extraction applications [7].​  

Beyond simple dissolution, DESs can be tailored for specific extraction tasks. A novel hydrophobic DES prepared from trioctylmethylammonium chloride and thymol, for example, was successfully applied to extract and separate Fe(III) and $\mathsf { C u } ( \mathsf { I I } )$ from the leaching solution derived from lithium-ion battery cathode materials, illustrating their capacity for specific ion partitioning [10]. The recycling of valuable metals from spent lithium-ion batteries represents a significant application area where DESs are being explored [8,26].  

Task-specific DESs can leverage acidity, reducibility, and coordination capabilities for high-efficiency, one-step dissolution and separation of metals from spent cathodes [16]. Examples include phytic acid-based DESs and polyethylene glycol-based DESs, which have been used for efficient recovery and dissolution of materials like LiCoO​2​ from cathodes under mild temperatures [16]. Novel DES formulations are also being investigated for their ability to significantly improve dissolution efficiency at low temperatures [16]. Furthermore, DES dissolution followed by solvent-induced crystallization has been utilized for the upcycling of spent cathodes into valuable materials like cobalt–polyphenol networks [16].  

The rational design of DESs with optimized selectivity and capacity for target metal ions is crucial for advancing their application in metal extraction and recycling. This requires a thorough understanding of the interactions between the DES components, metal species, and the matrix material. While the development of predictive thermodynamic models and the application of machine learning techniques can significantly accelerate the discovery and design of DESs with desired properties, specific detailed examples of how these modeling approaches have been applied directly to design DESs for metal recycling with high selectivity and capacity were not available within the scope of the provided literature digests. However, the diversity of DES compositions and the range of metal species they can selectively interact with, as demonstrated by the examples discussed, underscore the potential for future work in this area, guided by computational approaches to optimize DES performance for specific separation challenges.  

# 5.7 Electrochemistry and Energy Applications  

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have attracted significant attention for their potential applications in the energy sector, particularly as alternative electrolytes and working fluids. Their unique properties, such as tuneable viscosity, high thermal stability, low flammability, and potentially wide electrochemical windows, make them suitable candidates for various energy storage and conversion technologies [19,31].​  

A primary area of application for DESs is as electrolytes in electrochemical devices, including batteries, supercapacitors, and redox flow batteries [19,22,29,31]. For effective performance in these systems, key properties such as high ionic conductivity and a wide electrochemical window are crucial [19,34]. The ionic conductivity, which dictates the mobility of charge carriers within the electrolyte, is significantly influenced by the DES composition and structure, as well as temperature and the presence of impurities like water [13,19]. Transport properties, such as viscosity, are intimately linked to ionic conductivity, with lower viscosity generally facilitating higher ion transport [13,22]. The electrochemical window, defining the potential range within which the electrolyte is stable against decomposition, is also dependent on the constituent components of the DES [19]. Research in this domain includes investigating specific electrochemical processes in DESs, such as zinc and lithium electrodeposition and dissolution, and the formation and characteristics of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on lithium anodes, which is critical for battery longevity and safety [19]. Studies utilizing techniques like insituspecies analysis contribute to a deeper understanding of electrolyte behavior under operating conditions [23]. The performance of DESbased electrolytes in specific applications like iron-vanadium redox flow batteries has been investigated, focusing on electrochemical characteristics, transport properties, and the impact of external factors like temperature [22]. Modeling and simulation of non-aqueous redox flow batteries using DES electrolytes are also explored to predict and optimize system performance [22].​  

Beyond electrochemical storage, DESs are being explored as alternative working fluids in thermal energy systems. A notable application is in absorption refrigeration systems, where DESs can serve as environmentally benign absorbents [27]. In this context, accurate modeling of the thermodynamic properties of DESs, such as vapor pressure, heat capacity, and enthalpy of mixing with refrigerants, is indispensable [27]. These thermodynamic properties are critical parameters for designing efficient absorption cycles and predicting system performance metrics like the coefficient of performance (COP). Research involves evaluating the thermodynamic behavior of various DES-refrigerant pairs to identify optimal combinations for enhanced refrigeration efficiency [27].  

Other energy-related applications where the thermodynamic properties of DESs are relevant include thermal energy storage. For instance, DES nanofluids have been explored for thermal energy storage applications, leveraging their ability to store and release heat [43]. While not solely focused on DES thermodynamic modeling, studies on advanced thermal energy storage composites highlight the broader context where DESs could potentially be employed and where understanding their thermal behavior is necessary [43]. The application of DESs in energy systems, including their use in redox flow batteries relevant to areas like solar energy utilization, underscores the need for comprehensive thermodynamic characterization and modeling to facilitate their widespread adoption and optimize their performance across diverse energy technologies [22].  

# 5.8 Confinement and Interfaces  

The behavior of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) can be profoundly altered when subjected to spatial confinement or placed at interfaces, differing significantly from their bulk properties. These changes are particularly relevant for applications involving porous materials, thin films, and heterogeneous catalysis [18]. Studying DESs in these non‐bulk environments is crucial for understanding their performance and potential in diverse technological contexts.​  

Experimental approaches have been employed to probe the characteristics of DESs in confined spaces and at surfaces. For instance, studies investigating the dynamics of molecules within confined geometries—such as the diffusion of polymers (like dextran and sodium polyacrylate) in channels with varying gap heights ranging from 0.077 to $2 1 . 8 \mu \mathrm { m }$ —utilize techniques like Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy in Channels (CLiC) [18]. Although focused on polymers, such methodologies demonstrate the capability to analyze transport phenomena under confinement, which are intrinsically linked to local thermodynamic states. Furthermore, the influence of surface properties on molecular behavior in confinement has been explored, for example, by investigating the effect of surface treatment on dextran diffusion [18].  

At solid–liquid interfaces, particularly electrochemical interfaces between electrodes (such as Au, Cu, and Ag) and DESs or ionic liquids, their structural and physical properties are distinct from the bulk liquid [19]. Research in this area often employs advanced in‑situ techniques like Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to directly image and probe the interface, often under electrochemical control [19]. These studies reveal insights into phenomena such as ion adsorption, layering, and the electric double layer structure, which are critical for electrochemical applications and catalysis.  

The underlying mechanisms responsible for the altered thermodynamic properties of DESs in confinement or at interfaces are complex. Confinement can restrict molecular movement, perturb the delicate hydrogen bonding network characteristic of DESs, and induce molecular layering near surfaces. At interfaces, specific interactions between DES components (hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, salts) and the surface material dictate local composition, orientation, and dynamics, leading to changes in properties like viscosity, conductivity, and solvation strength. The application of electrochemical control further modifies the interfacial environment by influencing charge distribution and electrostatic interactions [19]. Understanding these mechanisms is vital for predictive modeling of DES behavior in these challenging environments and optimizing their performance in relevant applications.​

Accurate thermodynamic modeling of Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) is hindered by several primary challenges arising from their intrinsic complexity and the current state of research infrastructure. A significant hurdle lies in the difficulty of capturing the complex, synergistic intermolecular interactions that characterize DESs across diverse compositions using simple, generalized models [3,16,36]. These interactions, particularly the intricate hydrogen bonding networks, are crucial for understanding DES properties but are not yet fully understood [6,31]. There is a specific lack of complete knowledge regarding interactions between common components like choline chloride and alcohols [6]. Furthermore, accurately capturing these complex intermolecular forces in simulations remains a key challenge [31].  

Another critical issue is the limited availability and variable quality of experimental data for many DES systems, which severely hampers model development, parameterization, and validation [3,16,36]. Specific examples include the tedious nature of experimental viscosity measurements, particularly for ternary systems across wide composition and temperature ranges [13], and a notable gap in the study of heat capacity data compared to traditional solvents [4]. The hygroscopic nature of many DESs introduces variability, as even small amounts of absorbed water can significantly alter properties and experimental measurements [15]. Moreover, the need for in situ techniques to accurately elucidate phase behavior in complex DES-based systems under reaction conditions presents an experimental challenge [38].​  

Computational methods also face significant limitations. Highly accurate techniques, such as ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), are computationally expensive, restricting their applicability to small systems and short timescales [16,36]. Similarly, reservoir simulations can incur substantial computational costs [11]. For classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, there is an ongoing need for improved and more accurate force fields that can better represent the complex behavior and interactions within DESs [16,36]. Existing models also struggle with transferability across different DES systems or even with compositional changes within a system, as seen with interaction parameters for models like e-NRTL [1]. The challenge of balancing model accuracy with the number of adjustable parameters is also a common issue in thermodynamic modeling of DESs [12]. Specific challenges include the lack of models capable of capturing the composition dependency of viscosity [13]. Broader challenges in DES research highlighted in the digests include understanding complex interfacial electrochemistry [19], mitigating protein denaturation during extraction [37], improving the systematic understanding of properties [10], enhancing absorption performance for specific applications [27], and addressing the challenge of effective DES recycling for industrial applications [10].​  

To overcome these challenges, future research directions should focus on several key areas.  

• Model Development: Developing more accurate, transferable, and physically meaningful models is essential to capture the nuances of DES interactions across different compositions and conditions [3,16,36]. This includes developing predictive models that incorporate the influence of hydrogen bond networks and other specific interactions on macroscopic properties like viscosity, based on the components and their ratios [6]. Refined computational models and force fields are needed to accurately represent complex intermolecular forces [31]. Addressing misunderstandings in existing models and providing clearer documentation can also improve model reliability [12].  

• Experimental Data: A concerted effort is needed to generate systematic, high-quality experimental measurements of key thermodynamic properties for a wider range of DES systems [16,36]. Encouraging data standardization and sharing is crucial for building robust databases for model development and validation. High-throughput experimentation coupled with active learning shows promise in efficiently guiding experimental design and data acquisition, reducing the effort needed for characterization campaigns like viscosity measurements [13]. Continued investigation into the factors controlling properties like conductivity and viscosity, such as ion mobility and void availability, is also important [7]. Further studies are needed to characterize the environment of water in hygroscopic DES systems [15].  

• Integration of Approaches: Combining experimental data, molecular simulations (MD, QM), and thermodynamic models in an integrated framework can leverage the strengths of each approach to gain deeper insights and improve predictive capabilities [3,16,36]. For example, using simulations to understand interactions between DES components and solutes can aid in optimizing applications like extraction [28].  

• Machine Learning: The increasing potential of machine learning (ML) and active learning (AL) should be further explored for rapid property prediction and accelerating DES discovery and design [4,13]. ML techniques offer promising avenues for efficient design of novel DESs with tailored functionalities, such as predicting heat capacity [4]. However, there is a concurrent need for developing interpretable ML models to provide physical insights [4].  

• Multi-scale Modeling: Developing multi-scale approaches is promising for linking molecular-level insights obtained from simulations to macroscopic thermodynamic properties and process behavior [16,36].  

• Specific Interactions: Dedicated research is required to accurately model specific interactions beyond generic hydrogen bonding, such as charge transfer or complex formation, which might be crucial for certain DES types or applications [16,36]. Understanding the influence of molecular structure on properties is vital [31]. Developing a deeper understanding of interfacial structure and its relationship to macroscopic properties is also important [19].​  

• Model Validation: Rigorous model validation using independent experimental datasets is paramount to ensure the reliability and applicability of developed models.  

Beyond thermodynamic modeling specifically, future work in the broader DES field should include focusing on mitigating undesirable effects like protein denaturation [37], optimizing DES composition and process conditions for specific applications such as biomass conversion [30,35] and separation processes [2], exploring the economic feasibility of largescale production and recycling [10,30], and extending computational tools to handle more complex systems [25]. Continued fundamental research is needed for a systematic understanding of DES properties [10].  

# 7. Conclusion  

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) represent a class of sustainable solvents offering significant advantages over traditional organic solvents and even ionic liquids, including low saturated vapor pressure, non-toxicity, degradability, and costeffectiveness [10,32]. Their unique properties, stemming from the complex network of hydrogen bond interactions between hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) and hydrogen bond donors (HBDs), make them promising candidates for a wide array of industrial and scientific applications [6,10,32]. Accurately understanding and modeling the thermodynamic properties of DESs is paramount to unlocking their full potential, enabling rational design and process optimization across diverse fields.  

Significant advancements have been made in both experimental techniques and computational/theoretical models for probing and predicting DES thermodynamic behavior. Experimental techniques such as spectroscopic methods, including  

MAS NMR, have proven powerful in elucidating specific hydrogen bond interactions and their dynamics over various temperatures, providing crucial insights into the fundamental structure–property relationships of DESs [6,15]. Techniques like _operando_ PXRD and thermal analysis offer valuable frameworks for studying the complex phase behavior in reaction systems, potentially involving DESs [38]. Furthermore, the integration of high-throughput experimentation with active learning algorithms and Gaussian Process Regression has demonstrated remarkable efficiency in characterizing properties like viscosity across wide composition and temperature ranges, significantly reducing experimental effort and accelerating DES design [13].​  

Alongside experimental progress, computational and theoretical modeling approaches have become indispensable tools. Techniques ranging from abinitiomolecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations provide fundamental insights into structural aspects and interactions, revealing how subtle differences, such as the position of hydroxyl groups in HBDs, influence DES properties [31]. Equation of state models like PC-SAFT have shown effectiveness in describing the phase behavior of DESs with various solutes, such as $C O _ { 2 }$ ​ , underscoring the value of these models for predicting industrially relevant properties [24]. Activity coefficient models, such as the e-NRTL model parameterized with readily available SLE data, have been successfully applied to predict VLE behavior, offering practical alternatives to direct measurements [1]. The development of tools like Shermo facilitates the calculation of molecular thermochemistry data, supporting theoretical investigations [25]. Moreover, data-driven approaches, particularly machine learning models like Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), have shown improved accuracy in predicting complex properties such as heat capacity compared to traditional methods. Coupling these models with interpretability techniques like SHAP analysis offers valuable insights into the key structural factors influencing these properties, guiding the efficient design of novel DESs with tailored functionalities [4]. Open-source initiatives providing benchmark implementations and databases, such as for COSMO-SAC, further enhance reproducibility and accessibility in computational modeling [12].  

The accurate thermodynamic understanding and modeling derived from these integrated approaches are crucial for unlocking the full potential of DESs in diverse applications. This is evident in their successful use in extraction processes, such as the effective ultrasound-assisted extraction of polyphenols from natural products using choline chloride-based DESs [28], and green protein extraction [37]. They are applied in various separation tasks, including the absorption of acidic gases, extraction of metal ions, phenols, and aromatic compounds, desulfurization of fuels, and separation of isomers and alcohol–ester mixtures [2,5,21]. DESs are also valuable in reaction engineering, serving as solvents for biomass conversion processes, enabling the efficient pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass and tailoring lignin properties [30,35], and dissolving metal oxides [7]. Their application extends to pharmaceuticals, aiding in drug solubilization and potentially acting as drug delivery systems, where understanding interactions is vital [14,15]. The ability to model their phase behavior with gases is important for applications like $C O _ { 2 }$ ​ capture [3,24].​  

Despite the significant progress, challenges remain. Expanding the range of DES applications requires further research to fully understand their behavior in complex systems and address potential compatibility issues, such as their impact on the structure and properties of biomolecules during extraction [32,37]. Furthermore, accurately predicting the thermodynamic properties of the vast number of possible DES combinations remains a considerable task.​  

Looking ahead, the future of modeling thermodynamic properties of DESs is highly promising. Continued progress will likely stem from the synergistic combination of advanced experimental techniques, sophisticated computational models, and powerful data-driven approaches. This integrated strategy, leveraging high-throughput screening, machine learning, and fundamental molecular simulations, will accelerate the design and optimization of DESs with precisely tailored properties for specific applications. The growing body of research underscores the critical role of thermodynamic modeling in advancing DES science and enabling their widespread adoption as sustainable and efficient solvents across industries.
