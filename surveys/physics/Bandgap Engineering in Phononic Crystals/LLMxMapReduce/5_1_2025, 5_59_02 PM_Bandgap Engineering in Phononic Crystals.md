# 1. Introduction  

Phononic crystals (PCs) and acoustic metamaterials represent a class of engineered artificial composite structures designed to precisely control the propagation and dissipation of acoustic and elastic waves [5,6,21]. Unlike natural materials, these periodic structures exhibit unique wave manipulation capabilities, primarily stemming from the formation of phononic bandgaps—specific frequency ranges within which wave propagation is forbidden [1,9,19]. The bandgap phenomenon in PCs arises fundamentally from periodic Bragg scattering, analogous to electron behavior in solid-state crystals, and can also be influenced by localized resonances of individual structural components [21].  

Bandgap engineering, the deliberate design and manipulation of these bandgaps, is of paramount importance as it allows for tailored control over acoustic and elastic wave transmission for a wide array of specific purposes [28,33]. The field has seen rapid development, leading to the creation of acoustic metamaterials with novel functionalities [21,33]. This increasing interest is evident across various sectors, including government, the science and technology community, and industry [28].  

The primary motivations driving research in bandgap engineering are multifaceted. A key objective is to control wave behavior for diverse applications such as vibration reduction, wave filtering, and sound insulation [1,7,8,9,13]. Specific advanced wave manipulation functionalities include acoustic cloaking, focusing, super-resolution imaging, signal buffering, and directional radiation/reception [6]. Furthermore, bandgap engineering is crucial for developing novel functional devices like acoustic integrated chips operating in the $1 0 \mathsf { K H z }$ to 2 GHz range [25], confining terahertz phonons for enhanced optomechanical coupling in quantum information technologies [22], enabling controllable radio frequency (RF) wave propagation [11], and mitigating quantum decoherence in solid-state qubits by controlling phonon interactions [3]. The ability to tune acoustic resonances dynamically, even in nanoscale mechanical resonators highly sensitive to perturbations, also highlights the fine-grained control achievable through bandgap manipulation [20].

Despite significant progress, the field faces notable challenges. Traditional design methods, often involving iterative theoretical derivation, numerical simulation, and experimental validation to achieve specific structural-functional responses, are computationally expensive and inefficient, struggling to accurately manipulate waves and achieve optimal performance [5,9]. Accurately capturing complex geometries and material interface conditions, critical for Bragg scatteringbased PCs, presents computational design hurdles [18,19]. Furthermore, miniaturizing and characterizing acoustic metamaterials for high-frequency applications, such as ultrasound control at the microscale, remains challenging [2]. A  

critical practical challenge is the sensitivity of artificial structure units to defects and interferences, often due to precise lattice designs and stress concentrations, which hinders their translation from laboratory explorations of novel properties to robust, functional materials suitable for real-world applications [25,28,33].  

These challenges simultaneously open avenues for significant opportunities. Advancements in computational techniques, including machine learning (ML) for inverse design and optimization [4,5,8,9,13] and topology optimization methods like the level set approach for improved boundary accuracy [18], are overcoming the limitations of traditional design. The development of topological phononic crystals, drawing analogies from condensed matter physics, offers a promising approach to achieve robust, defect-immune wave transmission, addressing the sensitivity issue of traditional structures [6,25]. The integration of smart materials for dynamically controllable bandgaps [7] and the utilization of novel materials like h-BN for micro/nano-scale devices [11] further expand the possibilities.  

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of bandgap engineering in phononic crystals. It begins by detailing the fundamental principles and mechanisms governing bandgap formation. Subsequent sections delve into various design strategies, including conventional analytical and numerical methods, as well as recent advances in computational approaches such as topology optimization and machine learning-based inverse design. The review then explores the diverse applications enabled by bandgap engineering, ranging from macroscopic noise and vibration control to micro/nanoscale wave manipulation for sensing, communication, and quantum technologies. Finally, current challenges and future directions in the field are discussed, highlighting the potential for transforming materials with controllable wave propagation into broadly functional technologies.​  

# 2. Fundamentals of Phononic Crystals and Bandgap Formation  

Phononic crystals (PnCs) represent a class of artificially engineered materials characterized by a periodic arrangement of constituent materials or structures with significantly contrasting acoustic or elastic properties, such as mass density and elastic modulus [3,8,19]. This deliberate periodicity enables an unprecedented ability to control and manipulate the propagation of acoustic and elastic waves [11,28,33]. A fundamental and defining characteristic of phononic crystals is the existence of phononic bandgaps, which are specific frequency ranges where wave propagation through the periodic structure is significantly attenuated or entirely forbidden, analogous to electronic bandgaps in semiconductors [1,3,7,9,11,18,20,23,28]. The presence, location, and width of these bandgaps are intrinsically linked to the geometry, periodicity, and material properties of the PnC structure [13,21].​  

![](images/4d7ddfca6f4688d718b316c7f058cf75a1a9f16b3f6cc6aa787f08325e133d39.jpg)  

Bandgap formation in phononic crystals arises from distinct physical mechanisms governing the wave–structure interaction. The primary mechanisms include Bragg scattering, local resonance, and topological effects [8]. Bragg scattering is a fundamental mechanism resulting from the constructive interference of waves scattered by the periodic arrangement of interfaces within the crystal [1,18,20]. Bandgaps form when the wavelength $( \lambda )$ is comparable to the lattice periodicity $( a )$ , typically around $\lambda \approx 2 a$ , leading to forbidden frequency bands [21]. Bragg bandgaps primarily occur at frequencies inversely proportional to the lattice constant and are strongly dependent on the acoustic impedance contrast between materials [21]. Examples include bandgaps used to suppress phonon transport for thermal conductivity reduction in 3D silicon lattices [27] and for isolating qubits from environmental noise [3].  

In contrast, local resonance involves embedding resonant elements within the structure, creating bandgaps at frequencies significantly lower than those predicted by the Bragg limit—often in the subwavelength regime [1]. This occurs due to energy localization and dissipation within the resonators near their resonance frequencies, making it effective for lowfrequency vibration isolation [1]. This mechanism is utilized in phononic crystal waveguides with coupled h-BN resonators [11] and in periodic pipes with expansion chambers [1], and it can be influenced by material phase changes [30].  

Topological effects represent a distinct mechanism that leverages the topological properties of the band structure to create robust edge or surface states within bandgaps, allowing wave propagation that remains unaffected by certain defects [8,25]. Topological bandgaps can arise from topological phase transitions induced by tuning geometric parameters, such as rotating features within the unit cell to alter band degeneracy and induce band inversion [6] or by changing the shape of the elements [22,34]. These robust states enable phenomena such as immune wave guiding [35]. In summary, while Bragg scattering and local resonance focus on inhibiting bulk wave propagation at different frequency scales, topological effects provide a means for robust wave transmission along predefined paths. Hybrid systems can also combine these mechanisms [1].​  

Analyzing wave propagation and predicting bandgap formation in these periodic structures relies on a theoretical framework rooted in continuum mechanics, specifically the elastic wave equation. Bloch's theorem is central to this analysis, stating that wave solutions in a periodic potential are modulated plane waves with the same periodicity as the lattice. This reduces the problem to the analysis of a single unit cell with periodic boundary conditions [23]. This approach enables the calculation of band structures, which graphically depict the allowed and forbidden frequency bands (bandgaps).

Numerical methods are essential for solving these problems and calculating band structures. The Plane Wave Expansion (PWE) method is computationally efficient for simple geometries by expanding fields and properties in Fourier series. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used due to its ability to accurately model complex geometries and material interfaces by discretizing the domain [17,18,31], making it prevalent for bandgap calculations and for validating other methods [1,7,9,22,23]. Variations like the Petrov–Galerkin FEM are also applied [19]. For nanoscale structures, where size effects are significant, theoretical frameworks incorporate concepts such as nonlocal elasticity and atomistic-scale simulations (e.g., ab initio methods, Monte Carlo, and Green's functions) to accurately model phonon transport and predict vibrational properties and potential bandgaps [17,23,27,31,32,35].  

These theoretical frameworks and modeling techniques provide the foundation for understanding how various parameters influence bandgap properties, which is key to bandgap engineering. Critical factors include the contrast and specific properties of constituent materials, such as mass density, elastic constants, and phase behavior [3,7,9,19,21,30]. Geometric parameters—including lattice constant, filling fraction, scatterer shape, size, and arrangement, as well as layer thickness— are crucial for determining the location and width of both Bragg and local resonance bandgaps [1,8,13,20,21,22,23,27,30,34,37]. Crystal symmetry significantly impacts band degeneracy and the topology of the band structure [6,21,30]. Furthermore, external conditions such as pressure and mechanical strain can tune material properties and structural configurations, thereby influencing bandgap characteristics [11,32,35]. By modeling the interplay of these factors within the described theoretical frameworks, researchers can predict band structures and bandgaps, providing the essential knowledge base for engineering phononic crystals with tailored acoustic properties.  

# 2.1 Definition and Basic Properties  

Phononic crystals (PnCs) are engineered materials characterized by a periodic variation of acoustic properties, such as mass density and elastic modulus [3,8,19]. This deliberate structural periodicity, akin to the atomic lattice in natural crystals, enables unprecedented control over acoustic and elastic wave propagation [11,28,33]. The primary mechanism governing wave behavior in PnCs is Bragg scattering, where waves reflecting from periodic interfaces undergo destructive interference, leading to the attenuation or complete suppression of propagation within specific frequency ranges [18].  

A defining characteristic of phononic crystals is the existence of phononic bandgaps. Analogous to electronic bandgaps in semiconductors that prohibit the flow of electrons within certain energy ranges, a phononic bandgap represents a range of frequencies where acoustic or elastic wave propagation through the crystal is forbidden [1,3,7,9,11,18,20,23,28]. The presence and characteristics (location, width) of these bandgaps are fundamentally determined by the geometry, periodicity, and constituent materials of the phononic crystal structure [13,21].​  

Phononic crystals can be broadly classified by their dimensionality into one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) structures. 1D PnCs, such as multilayered structures or superlattices, consist of periodic variations along a single direction [3,22]. 2D PnCs involve periodicity in a plane, often realized as a lattice of inclusions or holes embedded in a host matrix [3,4,6,21]. Examples include periodic arrangements of unit cells with triangular holes in plates or square lattices of square holes in membranes [6,20]. These 2D structures are particularly relevant for manipulating surface acoustic waves or elastic waves in thin plates and membranes and often operate in the hypersonic range with submicron or nanometer scale elements [21]. 3D PnCs, featuring periodicity in all three spatial dimensions, offer comprehensive control over bulk wave propagation [13,23,27]. Common 3D structures involve periodic arrangements of spheres or pores within a matrix, such as spherical pores in a silicon matrix [2,27]. More complex 3D configurations, including twisted lattices and structures with intricate inclusions like split-ring resonators, are also explored to achieve unique bandgap properties and functionalities [13].​  

The structural characteristics of PnCs are defined by their unit cell geometry and lattice arrangement. These units can consist of inclusions of one material embedded in a matrix of another, or voids (holes) within a solid material [19]. The shape, size, and spatial arrangement of these unit cells, along with the acoustic impedance contrast between the constituent materials, dictate the resulting band structure and bandgap properties [8]. Constituent materials vary widely depending on the target frequency range and application, ranging from solid–solid composites and solid–fluid systems to specific materials like silicon [27], GaAs/AlAs heterostructures [22], h-BN van der Waals crystals [11], or even structures involving air/vacuum embedded within a matrix [6]. Phononic crystals based on elastic solid matrices are often termed elastic phononic crystals (EPCs), while those with a fluid matrix are known as acoustic phononic crystals (APCs) [21].  

# 2.2 Mechanisms of Bandgap Formation  

Bandgap formation in phononic crystals stems from distinct physical mechanisms that govern the interaction of acoustic or elastic waves with a periodic structure. The primary mechanisms include Bragg scattering, local resonance, and topological effects, each yielding characteristic bandgap properties and applications [8].  

Bragg scattering is a fundamental mechanism for bandgap creation, analogous to electron bandgaps in solid-state physics or photonic bandgaps in optical crystals. It arises from the constructive interference of waves scattered by the periodic arrangement of materials or structures within the crystal [1,18,20]. This interference is strongest when the wavelength $( \lambda )$ of the propagating wave is comparable to the lattice periodicity (a) of the phononic crystal, specifically when  

$$
\lambda \approx 2 \mathsf { a }
$$  

for waves incident normally on the planes of scatterers, leading to forbidden frequency bands where waves cannot propagate [21]. The presence and width of Bragg bandgaps depend strongly on both the lattice periodicity and the acoustic impedance contrast between the constituent materials [21]. Structures relying on this principle, such as 3D silicon lattices with spherical pores, effectively scatter phonons, resulting in bandgaps that reduce thermal conductivity [27]. Similarly, periodic arrangements in materials analogous to photonic crystals are utilized to create bandgaps that isolate qubits from environmental noise [3].​  

In contrast to Bragg scattering, which relies on long-range periodicity, local resonance provides a mechanism for creating bandgaps at frequencies significantly lower than the Bragg limit. This phenomenon occurs when resonant elements are embedded within the phononic crystal structure [1]. The interaction between the incident wave and these local resonators leads to energy localization and dissipation within the resonators, effectively preventing wave propagation at frequencies near their resonance frequencies [1]. This is particularly advantageous for isolating low-frequency vibrations and noise. Examples include phononic crystal waveguides utilizing coupled h-BN nanomechanical resonators for controlling RF wave propagation through manipulation of coupling strength [11], and periodic pipes with expansion chambers that induce locally resonant bandgaps [1]. Research also explores tuning bandgaps through phase changes of materials used as scatterers in locally resonant metamaterials [30], indicating the versatility of this mechanism.  

A third distinct mechanism leverages the topological properties of the phononic crystal band structure. Topological effects lead to the formation of topologically protected edge or surface states that exist within the phononic bandgaps [8]. These states exhibit remarkable robustness, allowing wave propagation along designated paths or surfaces without being affected by fabrication defects or disorder that typically cause backscattering in conventional phononic crystals [25]. Topological bandgaps can be achieved through various methods, such as inducing a topological phase transition by tuning geometric parameters. For instance, rotating triangular holes in a phononic crystal plate can lead to a phase transition, marked by the formation of fourfold degenerate states at the Brillouin zone center (Γ), with the rotation angle (θ) serving as a key control parameter [6]. This approach can simplify the unit cell design compared to methods relying on band folding [6]. Other techniques include altering the symmetry of unit cell elements and defining a winding number in parameter space, as demonstrated with Finite Barrier Enabled Bound States in the Continuum (FBICs) by changing circular to elliptical dielectric shapes [34]. Additionally, band inversion through adjusting the layer thickness in superlattices can yield nontrivial topological bands and confined topological interface states [22]. Specific implementations involve the use of split-ring resonators for tunable acoustic topological insulators and the harnessing of translation-rotation coupling in threedimensional structures [8,13]. Topological phenomena enable unique wave behaviors such as robust wave guiding, rainbow trapping, and valley transport via edge states [35].​  

In summary, Bragg scattering typically generates bandgaps at higher frequencies determined by the lattice constant, whereas local resonance excels at creating bandgaps at lower, sub-wavelength frequencies, making it suitable for applications like vibration isolation. Topological effects can induce robust wave transport either within existing Bragg or local resonance bandgaps or create entirely new topologically nontrivial gaps. While Bragg and local resonance mechanisms focus on preventing bulk wave propagation, topological effects concentrate on guiding robust wave propagation along boundaries or interfaces. Moreover, hybrid systems combining Bragg and local resonance mechanisms can exhibit bandgaps arising from the interplay of both effects, as seen in periodic pipes with expansion chambers [1]. The choice of mechanism depends on the target frequency range, required bandgap width, desired robustness against defects, and specific application requirements, which range from general acoustic and vibration filtering to advanced robust wave manipulation and thermal management [23].  

# 2.3 Theoretical Framework and Modeling Techniques  

Understanding the behavior of elastic waves in periodic media necessitates a robust theoretical framework rooted in the governing equations of continuum mechanics, typically the elastic wave equation. The inherent periodicity of phononic crystals allows for the application of Bloch's theorem, which posits that the wave solutions are plane waves modulated by a periodic function with the same periodicity as the lattice. This principle reduces the problem of analyzing wave propagation in an infinite crystal to analyzing a single unit cell subject to periodic boundary conditions, enabling the calculation of band structures that depict the allowed and forbidden frequency ranges (band gaps) for wave propagation.​  

Calculating these band structures often relies on various numerical methods, each possessing distinct advantages regarding computational cost, accuracy, and suitability for diverse geometries and material properties. Among the most widely adopted techniques are the Plane Wave Expansion (PWE) method and the Finite Element Method (FEM). The PWE method typically represents the material properties and wave fields as Fourier series expansions. While generally computationally efficient for structures with simple geometries and high periodicity, its accuracy can decrease for complex shapes or interfaces. In contrast, the Finite Element Method (FEM) discretizes the computational domain into smaller elements, allowing for accurate modeling of complex geometries and material boundaries, including arbitrary scatterer shapes [17,18,31]. Consequently, FEM is extensively utilized for band gap calculations [7,9,22,23] and validation of results obtained from other methods [1]. Variations of FEM, such as the enriched finite element method, have been employed to improve the accuracy of material boundary representation, particularly important for band gap computation and sensitivity analysis in topology optimization [18]. The Petrov-Galerkin Finite Element Method (PG-FEM) has also been introduced as a computational technique for band structure analysis [19].​  

Specific comparisons between methods reveal their relative strengths in particular scenarios. For instance, in the analysis of phononic crystal pipes, a combination of the two-dimensional mode matching method and the transfer matrix method was employed to determine band structure and transmission loss. This approach was validated using FEM, which showed good agreement with the results [1]. Furthermore, the study found this combined method to be more accurate than the onedimensional plane wave method within the analyzed frequency range for the specific pipe structure [1]. While the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method is a powerful tool for analyzing wave propagation and transient responses, it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided digests concerning band structure calculation, which is typically performed in the frequency domain.​  

Beyond these common techniques, the field incorporates advanced modeling considerations to address increasing complexity. For structures with intricate geometries, meshless methods, such as the local Radial Basis Function (RBF) collocation method, offer a compelling alternative to mesh-dependent methods like FEM [17,31]. These methods discretize governing equations on scattered points, bypassing the challenging process of mesh generation, which is particularly advantageous for complex shapes [31].  

Modeling nanoscale phononic crystals introduces additional complexities, requiring considerations of size effects not captured by classical elasticity theory. Nonlocal elasticity theory, which accounts for the influence of forces from nonadjacent points, is employed in meshless collocation methods for band structure simulation of nanoscale phononic crystals [17,31]. Furthermore, atomistic-scale methods, including ab initio simulations, Monte Carlo simulations, atomistic Green’s functions, and the valence force field model, are utilized to study phonon transport, thermal conductivity, and strain effects in nanostructures [27,32,35]. The Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), often coupled with phonon dispersion data from FEM, is applied to calculate thermal conductivity in nanoscale PCs [23].​  

Other specialized techniques cater to specific phenomena or applications, such as the frequency-domain Spectral Element Method for analyzing fluid-structure interaction in pipelines [30] and the development of semi-empirical models for sound absorption in composite structures [13]. Constitutive modeling, particularly for materials under thermo-mechanical loads like shape memory alloys, is also crucial for accurate simulation [7,30]. Simulations are also integral to design optimization procedures, including topology optimization using methods like enriched FEM [18] and iterative optimization within frameworks like genetic algorithms [4]. These diverse modeling techniques collectively form the computational backbone for designing, analyzing, and predicting the acoustic and thermal properties of phononic crystals across various scales and complexities.​  

# 2.4 Factors Influencing Bandgap Properties  

The formation and characteristics of phononic bandgaps, which represent frequency ranges where acoustic or elastic wave propagation is prohibited, are fundamentally governed by the interplay of various material, geometric, and external factors. A primary determinant of bandgap properties is the contrast in acoustic impedance between the constituent materials forming the phononic crystal structure. Variations in elastic constants and mass density among different materials are crucial for customizing band structures [19,21]. High mass density contrast in a matrix material can specifically lead to the formation of full band gaps [21]. The type and distribution of materials within multi-layered structures directly influence bandgap characteristics, as demonstrated in studies utilizing machine learning for material classification to optimize bandgap design [9]. Material properties, including phase changes, are explicitly recognized as factors influencing bandgaps, with investigations into scatterer viscous dissipation in phase change metamaterials highlighting their impact on bandgap drift [30]. Furthermore, the transformation of shape memory alloys from martensite to austenite phases has been shown to influence bandgap behavior [7]. Precise control over material properties is deemed essential for tailoring bandgaps to specific applications, such as tuning them to qubit energy levels for suppressing phonon-induced decoherence [3].​  

Geometric parameters play an equally critical role in defining bandgap properties, controlling both their location and width. Key parameters include the lattice constant, the filling fraction, and the shape, size, and arrangement of scatterers or inclusions. The lattice constant and period are fundamental in determining Bragg band gaps, which arise from coherent scattering effects [1,20]. The length of insertions or the ratio between constituent material lengths can significantly influence locally-resonant band gaps [1,23]. The filling ratio, often determined by the size and spacing of inclusions like pores, directly impacts the frequency range and width of bandgaps [21,27]. The specific geometry of structural elements, such as split-ring resonators, the twist in 3D structures, the shape of slits in sonic crystals, and the form of dielectric resonators (e.g., circular vs. elliptical), profoundly affects bandgap properties and wave propagation characteristics, including mode conversion and wavefront manipulation [8,13,30,34]. The size and arrangement of scatterers, such as spherical pores or masses, also influence wave speed and enable functionalities like wave guiding or focusing by tuning dynamic properties through geometric changes related to mass and stiffness [2,27]. The thickness of layers in structures like superlattices [22] and the number of layers in coupling structures [20] are further geometric factors influencing bandgaps and coupling strengths. Moreover, the shape of phononic crystal elements in anchoring boundaries can impact resonator quality factors [37].​  

Crystal symmetry also plays a critical role in shaping band structures and bandgap properties, notably affecting band degeneracy. Anisotropy, for instance, is a significant factor influencing elastic wave modes and their manipulation in metamaterials [30]. Lattice architecture impacts the ability to achieve full band gaps; studies indicate that FCC lattices are more favorable for full bandgap formation in 3D phononic crystals compared to BCC architectures [21]. Furthermore, adjusting the rotation angle of features within a unit cell, such as triangular holes, can alter band degeneracy. For example, a specific rotation angle ( $\pm 3 3 ^ { \circ }$ ) can lead to the formation of a double Dirac cone at the $\Gamma$ point, with band inversion occurring around this angle, indicating a topological phase transition [6].  

Beyond intrinsic material and geometric factors, external conditions can provide tunable control over phononic bandgaps. Pressure has been investigated for its influence on the properties of materials used in phononic crystals, and studies directly address the tunability of low-frequency bandgaps under varying pressures [35]. High pressure can indirectly affect bandgap properties by altering the structural and electronic characteristics of materials [35]. Mechanical stress or strain is another external parameter capable of tuning bandgap behavior [35]. Strain, often arising from lattice constant mismatches in nanostructures, significantly affects material properties, which in turn influences vibrational behavior and potential bandgaps [32]. The coupling strength between resonant units, which influences bandgap properties and enables the design of pass and stop bands, can also be considered a form of interaction influenced by structural configuration and potentially external forces [11]. The combined effect of geometric parameters and pre-compression strains under different pressures has also been studied for bandgap tunability [35].​

Bandgap engineering in phononic crystals involves the deliberate manipulation of structural and material parameters to control the propagation of acoustic and elastic waves, specifically by creating, tuning, or modifying frequency ranges where wave propagation is forbidden. This field encompasses a diverse array of techniques aimed at achieving desired bandgap characteristics, such as width, frequency location, and tunability [16,17,30,35]. These techniques can be broadly categorized based on whether they primarily modify the constituent materials, the structural geometry, introduce controlled imperfections, leverage external stimuli, or employ advanced computational and structural paradigms.​  

One fundamental approach lies in the Material Selection and Composition. The acoustic contrast between the materials forming the periodic structure is a primary driver for bandgap formation [21]. By carefully selecting materials with  

significant differences in density and elastic moduli, researchers can influence bandgap width and location [21,23]. Examples range from conventional material combinations for 3D PCs [23] to the use of superlattices for high frequencies [22], silicon and SiGe alloys [27], or tin-lead alloy perovskites where composition tunes phonon energy levels [10]. The emergence of smart and active materials like shape memory alloys enables dynamic tuning based on temperature [7,15], offering reversible control, although challenges remain regarding material compatibility, manufacturability, and long-term stability [25,27,30,35].​  

Complementary to material choice is the Geometric and Structural Optimization. The shape, size, arrangement, and filling fraction of elements within the phononic crystal unit cell profoundly impact its band structure [21]. Simple parameter variations, such as inclusion shape or lattice constant, are foundational [1,21]. More advanced strategies involve complex topological architectures and precise geometric adjustments, including multi-hole designs [35], split-ring resonators, or origami-inspired structures [13,15]. A powerful computational technique in this domain is topology optimization, which designs complex structures by optimizing material distribution to maximize bandgap characteristics [7,16,18,25]. While effective, the computational cost and complexity of fabricating intricate optimized geometries remain significant challenges [5,27,33].​  

Defect and Disorder Engineering introduces controlled imperfections or statistical variations into the periodic lattice. Localized defects like cavities or waveguides can create specific defect modes within the bandgap, enabling functionalities such as filtering or waveguiding [12,13,16,21]. Disorder, such as nanocrystalline structures or amorphous interfaces, primarily enhances phonon scattering, which is beneficial for applications like thermal conductivity reduction [27]. While defects offer precise mode control, and disorder can lead to effects like wave localization [12], artificial structures can be sensitive to imperfections and interference, requiring careful control over their introduction [33].  

External Field Tuning provides a dynamic means to modulate bandgaps by applying external stimuli. Mechanical stress, temperature, electric, magnetic, or optical fields can alter material properties or geometry [16,24,26,35,38]. Mechanical loading offers direct geometric tuning, temperature leverages temperature-dependent materials like SMAs [7], and smart materials (e.g., MR fluids, piezoelectrics) respond to magnetic or electric fields [16,26]. Advanced methods, like optomechanical interactions, allow for fine-tuning acoustic resonances [20]. The effectiveness, response time, reversibility, and energy consumption vary significantly between these methods.​  

Advanced design paradigms like Inverse Design and Machine Learning aim to bypass traditional trial-and-error or iterative optimization by directly mapping desired bandgap properties to the required structural parameters [5,8,13,28,30]. Machine learning algorithms, particularly neural networks, can learn complex structure-property relationships from data [9,12], while evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithms explore large design spaces to discover non-intuitive structures [4,5]. These computational approaches hold significant promise for accelerating the discovery and optimization of complex phononic structures [4,13].​  

Finally, the design of Metamaterials and Hybrid Structures represents a powerful approach to achieve exotic wave phenomena and bandgap properties, often by engineering structures at the subwavelength scale [25,33]. These structures can exhibit properties like negative mass or modulus [21], enabling acoustic cloaking [8,13] or topological waveguiding [8]. Metamaterials are particularly effective for generating low-frequency and broadband bandgaps [15,24,35] and realizing functionalities at subwavelength scales [24]. Coupled and Hybrid Approaches, often overlapping with metamaterial concepts, involve combining different bandgap formation mechanisms (e.g., Bragg scattering and local resonance) or integrating phononic crystals with other functional materials to create heterostructures or superlattices, leading to wider bandgaps or novel functionalities like topological control [1,6,15,22]. While enabling unprecedented wave control, metamaterials and complex hybrid structures can face challenges related to fabrication precision and sensitivity to defects [33].​  

In summary, bandgap engineering leverages a rich toolkit of techniques, spanning fundamental material selection and geometric design to advanced computational optimization, defect engineering, external field tuning, and the creation of complex metamaterial and hybrid architectures. Each approach offers distinct advantages and limitations, and the choice of technique depends heavily on the desired bandgap characteristics, target frequency range, application requirements, and manufacturing feasibility. Ongoing research continues to push the boundaries by exploring novel materials, intricate geometries, dynamic tuning mechanisms, and increasingly sophisticated design methodologies.​  

# 3.1 Material Selection and Composition  

The choice of constituent materials and their specific physical properties is paramount in engineering the bandgap characteristics of phononic crystals (PCs). The presence of a phononic bandgap, which prohibits acoustic or elastic wave propagation within certain frequency ranges, fundamentally arises from the contrast in acoustic properties between the materials forming the periodic structure [21]. Key material characteristics influencing bandgap formation and properties include density and elastic moduli [21].  

A significant contrast in these properties between the matrix and inclusion materials is typically required to open wide bandgaps [21].  

Researchers explore a diverse range of materials and combinations to achieve desired bandgap properties across different frequency regimes and applications. Examples of conventional material systems include 3D PCs composed of two materials with varying mass ratios [23], which inherently leverage density differences. For high-frequency applications, such as those in the terahertz range, superlattices like GaAs/AlAs are employed, utilizing the specific densities of constituent layers, for instance, $5 3 7 0 \mathrm { k g / m ^ { 3 } }$ for GaAs and $\mathbf { 3 8 1 0 \mathrm { k g / m ^ { 3 } } }$ for AlAs [22]. Silicon (Si) and silicon–germanium (SiGe) alloys are also widely studied due to their well-established acoustic properties and amenability to nanofabrication [27]. Varying the composition in SiGe alloys provides a method to tune thermal conductivity and phonon transport, directly impacting their acoustic behavior [27]. Similarly, tin–lead alloy perovskites demonstrate that regulating the tin–lead ratio can control phonon energy levels, potentially influencing carrier dynamics and energy loss rates in related applications [10]. Beyond simple combinations, research utilizes complex materials such as fiber-reinforced composite metamaterials and specialized alloys like GH4169 [30].​  

The field is increasingly leveraging advanced and novel materials. Lithium niobate, for instance, is identified as a critical material for future acoustic integrated chips, highlighting its potential for monolithic integration in topological PC structures [11,25]. Materials tailored for quantum applications, such as diamond with silicon vacancy centers for 1D PCs and superconducting materials for 2D bandgap structures, further showcase the breadth of material exploration [3]. Moreover, various materials suitable for metamaterial designs, including layered structures, perforated plates, and porous materials like open-cell foam, are explored for applications such as acoustic cloaking and sound absorption [8,13]. Computational studies also explore the properties of materials under extreme conditions, such as high pressure and temperature, relevant for designing PCs intended for harsh environments [35].  

A significant advancement involves the incorporation of smart and active materials to achieve dynamic bandgap tuning. Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are prominent examples in this domain [7]. By utilizing SMAs as constituent components or resonators in PC beams or metamaterials, researchers can dynamically switch or tune bandgaps [15]. Materials exhibiting solid–liquid phase change also offer potential for continuous bandgap evolution through temperature control [30]. The selection of material type and its specific distribution within the PC structure is recognized as critical for achieving targeted bandgaps, sometimes aided by methods like Softmax logistic regression for material selection in layered structures [9].  

Despite the broad spectrum of materials available, challenges remain in their selection and implementation. Material compatibility can be an issue, particularly when combining disparate materials in complex architectures. Manufacturability poses significant hurdles, especially for nanoscale structures or integrated devices involving novel materials like lithium niobate [25,30]. Fabricating precise periodic structures with high aspect ratios or incorporating smart materials with specific activation requirements adds complexity to the manufacturing process [27]. Furthermore, ensuring the long-term stability and performance of these materials, particularly in demanding applications or extreme environments, requires careful consideration [35].​  

# 3.2 Geometric and Structural Optimization  

Bandgap engineering in phononic crystals is fundamentally linked to the precise design and tailoring of the unit cell geometry. The periodic arrangement and shape of inclusions or scatterers significantly influence the propagation of elastic waves, thereby determining the location and width of forbidden frequency bands [21]. Key geometric parameters such as the inclusion shape, the filling factor of inclusions, and the lattice constant of the periodic array directly impact the band structure and the bandwidth of the forbidden band [1,21]. Beyond simple parameters, complex topological architectures that combine a range of dimensional features within a periodic arrangement are often necessary to achieve complete bandgaps [21].​  

Various strategies have been employed to optimize the geometric and structural characteristics of phononic crystals for desired bandgap properties. Studies have explored the impact of varying the width or shape of dielectric resonators, such as  

altering them from circular to elliptical, to modify the band structure and induce topological phase transitions [34]. In 3D phononic crystals, optimizing the ratio of constituent material lengths or varying the size and arrangement of spherical pores can be crucial for minimizing thermal conductivity by maximizing phonon scattering and creating wide bandgaps [23,27]. The rotation angle of perforations within a unit cell, for instance, can serve as a core geometric parameter $( \theta ~ )$ whose variation modifies the band structure and leads to topological phase transitions [6]. Simple geometrical changes, such as precisely positioning microscale spheres, have demonstrated the ability to expand the tunable dynamic property space of metamaterials, facilitating design and fabrication [2]. Examples of specific geometric designs investigated include multi-hole configurations for low-frequency bandgaps [35], split-ring resonators, kagome lattices, 3D twisted phononic crystals for tailored acoustic properties [13], origami-inspired metamaterials like graded Miura-ori lenses and longitudinaltorsional wave converters [15], and engineered coupling strengths between cavities by varying the number of phononic crystal layers [20]. For instance, controlling the number of layers between acoustic channels resulted in specific coupling strengths, such as 2.3 MHz for 5 layers and $1 . 2 M \mathsf { H } z$ for 6 layers, designed to satisfy conditions like $\frac { \Gamma _ { 0 } } { 2 } = J = \sqrt { J _ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + J _ { 2 } ^ { 2 } }$ ​ [20]. Another example shows the geometry optimization of an Ag bowtie nanocavity where the relationship between distance ( $D _ { x }$ ) and lateral size $( l )$ satisfies $| l | = 5 5 0 + 7 . 6 6 \ : | D _ { x } | - 0 . 1 5 6 \ : | D _ { x } | ^ { 2 }$ for a characteristic wavelength of $1 5 5 0 \mathsf { n m }$ [22]. These examples illustrate how meticulous geometric adjustments can lead to precise control over wave behavior.  

Topology optimization is a powerful computational method widely applied to design complex phononic crystal structures with optimized bandgaps [7,16,18]. This approach optimizes the material distribution within a defined design domain to achieve desired acoustic or elastic properties, often aiming to maximize the bandgap width or target specific bandgap characteristics [7,16]. Applications include designing ultra-wide and low-frequency bandgaps in acoustic metamaterials [12,16], realizing tailored self-collimation [16], and achieving full and directional bandgaps [16].​  

Different computational frameworks exist for topology optimization. Level set-based topology optimization methods, for instance, are utilized to design phononic crystals with crisp and well-defined boundaries [18]. This approach typically employs efficient computation of design sensitivities, facilitating gradient-based optimization to tailor bandgaps by modifying the structure's geometry [18]. In contrast, density-based methods, such as the variable density method, establish a topology optimization model by varying material density within each element [7]. An objective might be to maximize the relative bandgap under volume ratio and strength constraints, while ensuring connectivity [7]. Optimization algorithms like the Moving Asymptotic Method (MAM) are used, and design sensitivities are calculated using material interpolation models [7]. While level-set methods tend to produce clean boundaries suitable for fabrication, density-based methods are conceptually straightforward and widely implemented, though they can sometimes result in grayscale regions that require post-processing. Both methods rely heavily on the accurate and efficient computation of design sensitivities to guide the optimization process [7,18].​  

Beyond gradient-based topology optimization, other algorithms contribute to structural optimization. Genetic algorithms, for example, have been applied to the topological design of two-dimensional phononic crystals, optimizing structures for desired properties without relying on gradient information [13,35]. Multi-stage grid-pixel refinement methods also indicate research into alternative computational strategies for bandgap optimization [24]. The computational cost and complexity of these optimization processes are significant considerations. Traditional methods can be computationally expensive [5], motivating the exploration of more efficient approaches. The need for efficient sensitivity computation is critical for the practicality of gradient-based topology optimization [18]. Furthermore, the increasing complexity of optimized structures, while enabling novel wave phenomena, can pose challenges related to fabrication and potentially increase sensitivity to defects and interference, which may hinder their widespread practical application [28,33]. Recent advancements leverage machine learning algorithms to bypass traditional, computationally intensive optimization by directly mapping design parameters to desired functionalities [5], or by generating and optimizing topological structures based on large datasets [9]. This shift towards AI-based inverse design holds promise for accelerating the discovery and optimization of complex phononic structures [13].​  

# 3.3 Inverse Design and Machine Learning  

The design of phononic crystals (PCs) and acoustic metamaterials with desired bandgaps and wave propagation characteristics often involves complex structure–property relationships. Traditional design methods, relying heavily on iterative simulation and parametric studies, can be computationally expensive and time‐consuming. Consequently, there is an increasing trend toward leveraging computational intelligence techniques—particularly inverse design and machine learning (ML) algorithms—to accelerate this process [5,8,13,30]. The core objective of these approaches is to establish a direct mapping from desired acoustic properties to the necessary structural parameters, thereby bypassing the traditional, often tedious, forward simulation loop [5].  

Machine learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep learning models, are prominently used to learn the intricate correlation between a PC's topological structure and its resulting bandgap properties [9,12]. Once trained on a dataset of structures and their corresponding properties, these networks can efficiently predict the structure required to achieve a specific target bandgap or acoustic response [9,12]. For instance, ANNs can be trained for the inverse design of multilayered phononic crystals, employing techniques like softmax logistic regression for material selection and multi-task learning to determine material distribution within the structure. The trained network directly outputs the cell topology corresponding to a specified target bandgap [9]. This direct prediction capability significantly accelerates the design process compared to trial-and-error or purely simulation-based optimization methods [5].​  

Beyond direct mapping, optimization algorithms like genetic algorithms (GAs) are applied to explore vast and complex design spaces for novel PC structures [4,5]. GAs operate based on principles of natural selection, where candidate designs (individuals) are iteratively refined over generations. Designs are evaluated based on their performance (e.g., bandgap width or location), and successful designs are selected to “reproduce” and pass on their characteristics (structural parameters) to the next generation, often with variations (mutations) introduced to explore new possibilities [4]. This evolutionary approach allows for the discovery of nonintuitive or novel structural configurations that might be missed by gradient-based optimization or manual design processes [4]. The effectiveness of GAs in automatic inverse design has been experimentally validated for phononic crystal nanostructures, demonstrating their capability for precise control of acoustic waves [4].  

Deep learning, a subfield of ML, has been extensively applied to the topology and inverse design of various phononic and elastic metamaterials—including metasurfaces and metabarriers—targeting different wave modes such as Rayleigh waves, full-mode waves, and anti-plane waves [12]. Researchers have utilized deep learning models for tasks ranging from predicting dispersion relations of one-dimensional PCs to designing complex two-dimensional periodic structures and layered periodic barriers [12]. These efforts highlight the versatility and power of deep learning in handling the highdimensional design spaces typical of topological optimization problems [12]. While the provided digests primarily emphasize successful applications and the acceleration benefits [4,5], evaluating the performance and challenges associated with different ML models and optimization algorithms requires considering factors such as the volume and quality of training data needed for supervised learning approaches like ANNs, the computational cost of simulations within iterative optimization loops like GAs, and the ability of the chosen method to reliably converge to optimal or near-optimal solutions while avoiding local minima. Other optimization techniques, such as differential evolution and Nelder–Mead algorithms, have also been employed in related acoustic design problems—such as tuning resonance bandwidths [20]— further illustrating the broader application of computational optimization in acoustic material engineering. The success demonstrated across various studies underscores the significant potential of inverse design and ML techniques to revolutionize the design pipeline for phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials.  

# 3.4 Defect and Disorder Engineering  

Beyond the properties inherent in their perfect periodicity, the characteristics of phononic crystals can be significantly tailored through the introduction of controlled defects or intentional disorder. Defect engineering involves creating localized structural imperfections within the periodic lattice, which often leads to the formation of highly localized modes within the phononic bandgap. These defect modes can modify the band structure and enable novel functionalities [13,15]. Intentional imperfections serve as a powerful means to tailor wave propagation characteristics for specific applications [16].  

Various types of defects, such as point, line, and surface defects (including cavities, waveguides, and stubs), can be engineered to create acoustic wave manipulation devices [12,16,21]. For instance, the propagation of flexural waves in phononic crystal thin plates has been investigated by introducing both linear and point defects [12]. Point and line defects are commonly considered in the optimal design of phononic crystal microstructures [16]. Specifically, periodic point defects have been utilized in the design of narrow-band filters via topology optimization [16]. Defect modes introduced via cavities, waveguides, or stubs within a two-dimensional periodic structure can function as very selective frequency filters and efficient devices for wavelength demultiplexing [21]. Furthermore, specific defect configurations have been demonstrated to induce unidirectional flexural wave transmission [15] and can even be employed for structural health monitoring applications like crack detection using bandgap defect modes [15]. The introduction of impurities can also lead to the  

creation of multi-bit acoustic topological systems, further highlighting the potential of defect engineering to modify bandgaps and enable novel functionalities [13].  

Disorder, whether intentional or inherent, also significantly impacts wave propagation in phononic crystals. Introducing disorder, such as nanocrystalline structures and amorphous interfaces, increases phonon scattering [27]. This increased scattering can lead to macroscopic effects like a reduction in thermal conductivity [27]. A critical phenomenon associated with disorder is wave localization, where waves are confined to specific regions of the material instead of propagating freely. Vibration localization has been observed and studied in structures like disordered periodically stiffened double-leaf panels [12]. While disorder typically hinders wave propagation, in some contexts, like topological phononic crystals, the inherent robustness of topological edge states can lead to back-scattering immunity even when disorder, tortuosity, and cavities are introduced into the waveguide [6]. However, it is also recognized that the sensitivity of artificial structure units to defects and interference can restrict their practical application [33], underscoring the need for precise control over defect and disorder introduction.  

# 3.5 External Field Tuning  

Tuning the bandgaps of phononic crystals through external fields is a prominent approach for achieving dynamic control over acoustic and elastic wave propagation. Various external stimuli, including pressure, temperature, mechanical stress, electric fields, magnetic fields, and optical signals, have been explored to modify the material properties, geometry, or boundary conditions of PnC structures, consequently altering their band structure [16,24,26,35,38].​  

Mechanical loading, such as applied pressure or pre-compression strain, is a straightforward method to tune phononic bandgaps. This tuning mechanism primarily relies on altering the geometry and stiffness of the PnC unit cell [24,35]. By modifying the lattice parameters or the shape of scatterers within the periodic structure, the bandgap width and location can be shifted. This method is often effective for low-frequency bandgaps but can be limited by material deformation limits and the potential for irreversible changes under large strains.  

Temperature variation is another widely used external field for bandgap tuning, particularly when utilizing materials with temperature-dependent properties or phase transformations. Shape memory alloys (SMAs), for instance, exhibit a temperature-induced phase transformation between martensite and austenite phases, leading to significant changes in their mechanical properties [7,15]. Integrating SMAs into PnC structures allows for dynamic control of bandgaps by simply changing the temperature. This approach offers reversibility, but the response time is dependent on the thermal diffusion rate, and energy consumption relates to heating/cooling requirements. Temperature effects can also be combined with piezoelectric effects and microstructural design for tuning PnC microbeams [26].​  

The use of smart materials is central to enabling active tuning of phononic bandgaps. Beyond SMAs, magnetorheological (MR) smart materials are being investigated. Their viscosity and stiffness can be rapidly changed by applying a magnetic field. Topology optimization techniques have been applied to design PnCs incorporating MR materials for achieving tunable wide bandgaps [16]. Similarly, materials exhibiting tunable electrical or optical properties, such as Gd₁₋ₓCaₓBaCo₂O₅₊δ, can be influenced by external stimuli like solar energy or microwave stimulation to tailor their conductivity, which could potentially impact acoustic properties in composite structures [38]. Piezoelectric materials allow for electro-acoustic coupling, enabling bandgap tuning via applied electric fields [26].  

Advanced techniques leverage more complex physical interactions for fine-tuning. Active tuning via optomechanical interactions, for example, offers a pathway to dynamically control acoustic resonances with high precision. One demonstrated method involves varying the optical power ratio between input pump channels to tune acoustic resonance [20]. By coherently mixing the second- and third-order responses through modification of the mixing ratio and relative phase between input pumps, the center frequency can be continuously altered [20]. This technique demonstrated a maximum peak frequency shift of $2 . 7 5 \mathsf { M H z }$ , corresponding to $5 3 \%$ of an average dissipation rate of 5.13 MHz [20]. This method highlights the potential for fine-tuning bandwidth and peak frequency through sophisticated external field manipulation, though its applicability might be limited to specific resonant structures and frequency ranges. While optomechanical methods can offer fast response times, energy consumption and integration complexity might be considerations compared to simpler mechanical or thermal methods. Pressure and mechanical tuning methods are generally robust but may offer slower response times and potentially less fine control compared to electric, magnetic, or optical field tuning. The reversibility and repeatability of tuning are crucial considerations, with methods based on  

reversible material property changes (like SMA phase transitions or MR fluid stiffness changes) offering advantages over purely mechanical deformation methods that might lead to permanent structural changes.  

# 3.6 Coupled and Hybrid Approaches  

To overcome the limitations inherent in phononic crystals relying solely on a single bandgap formation mechanism, coupled and hybrid approaches have emerged as powerful strategies for advanced bandgap engineering. One significant approach involves coupling bandgaps arising from different physical mechanisms, such as Bragg scattering and local resonance, or even coupling multiple local resonance bandgaps. This combination has been demonstrated to yield wider bandgaps compared to those generated by individual mechanisms alone [1].​  

The width and location of these coupled bandgaps can be effectively tuned by adjusting structural parameters, including the lattice constant and the length of insertions within the structure [1]. Beyond combining fundamental mechanisms, the coupling of multiple resonant elements is also explored. For instance, investigations into mass-coupled Bragg atomic chains have focused on generating and switching hybrid bandgaps [15]. Similarly, tunable elastic metamaterials employing rotatable coupled dual-beam resonators enable the achievement of unique and controllable bandgap characteristics [15].  

Coupling of multiple phononic crystal acoustic cavities, often weakly, allows for precise acoustic resonance tuning by controlling coupling strengths between cavities [20]. Furthermore, coupled resonator systems, such as split-ring resonators, are utilized to create tunable acoustic second-order topological insulators, showcasing the potential of coupled designs to engineer complex band structures and topological properties [8,13].  

Another prominent strategy in coupled and hybrid approaches is the creation of heterostructures and superlattices by combining different types of phononic crystals or integrating phononic crystals with other functional materials. Supercells composed of phononic crystals possessing distinct topological phases can be designed to create specific elastic wave bandgaps and engineer pseudospin states, demonstrating the potential for topological control of wave propagation [6]. Hybrid structures that merge phononic crystals with other physical systems, such as plasmonic nanocavities, are also being developed. In such configurations, the phononic crystal provides effective phonon confinement, while the plasmonic component enhances the optical field, leveraging the synergistic advantages of both structures for novel multi-physical functionalities [22].​  

Collectively, these coupled and hybrid approaches significantly expand the design space for phononic crystals, offering enhanced control over bandgap properties, leading to wider bandgaps, novel band structures with topological or other advanced functionalities, and improved performance for various wave manipulation applications.  

# 3.7 Metamaterials and Hybrid Structures  

Metamaterials and hybrid structures represent a significant paradigm shift in acoustic and elastic wave control, enabling the realization of exotic properties not typically observed in natural materials. These engineered structures facilitate novel bandgap characteristics and advanced functionalities in artificial structure sound field control [25,33]. When engineered to exhibit properties such as negative mass density and elastic modulus, these structures satisfy the criteria for acoustic metamaterials [21]. This capability allows for acoustic functionalities such as cloaking [8,13], topological waveguiding [8], and the design of Willis metamaterials [8,13].​  

The design principles for metamaterials often focus on achieving specific wave manipulation capabilities. For instance, structures with anisotropic properties are crucial for targeted wave control. Research has demonstrated the use of fiberreinforced composite metamaterials for mode conversion of elastic waves and metamaterials with anisotropic mass density to achieve full mode-converting transmission, particularly notable in the ultralow frequency range [30]. Similarly, a twodimensional phononic metacrystal designed as a periodic arrangement of smaller units exhibits anisotropic behavior, allowing selective vibration along one axis while suppressing it along a perpendicular axis. This anisotropy is key to applications such as acoustic focusing and waveguiding [4]. More complex designs include programmable and multistable metamaterials based on precisely tailored bistable cells, as well as multi-channel phononic crystal resonant cavities, indicative of efforts towards advanced and versatile wave control [16].​  

A primary advantage of employing metamaterials and hybrid structures is their potential to overcome limitations inherent in conventional phononic crystals, particularly concerning the achievement of low-frequency and broadband bandgaps. Various metamaterial designs have been developed specifically for this purpose. Examples include Rayleigh beam underwater metamaterials optimized for low-frequency and broadband sound absorption [24], inertant elastic  

metamaterial plates engineered to exhibit extra wide low-frequency flexural band gaps [15], and plate-type acoustic metamaterials used to enhance the low-frequency sound transmission loss of double panels [35].  

Furthermore, metamaterials enable the realization of functionalities at subwavelength scales. Studies explore acoustic edge modes in spiral-based metamaterials at subwavelength dimensions [24], subwavelength chiral spiral acoustic metamaterials designed as robust topological acoustic insulators [24], and acoustic valley edge states in graphene-like systems incorporating sub-wavelength resonators [24].​  

Specific novel structures demonstrate unique properties crucial for bandgap engineering. These include structures exhibiting double negative (negative density and bulk modulus) and density-near-zero characteristics, such as threedimensional fractal structures [24] and Menger fractal acoustic metamaterials [24]. Investigations into concentric ring acoustic metamaterials and star-structured sonic metamaterials have also explored their band gap and double-negative properties [24]. Advanced microscale acoustic metamaterials are another area of focus, pushing the boundaries of wave control at smaller scales [2].​  

Hybrid structures combine different principles or materials to achieve desired outcomes. Examples include the use of partially embedded periodic pile barriers and gradient metabarriers designed for broadband shielding from seismic Rayleigh waves at ultralow frequencies, as well as a patented partially buried variable gradient Rayleigh wave barrier structure [12]. Another form of hybrid structure involves integrating a phononic crystal with a plasmonic cavity to enhance light-matter interaction at terahertz frequencies [22]. Research also extends to locally disordered metamaterials for directing and trapping water waves [15], showcasing the versatility of metamaterial concepts across different wave phenomena. These diverse structures and principles highlight the broad potential of metamaterials and hybrid designs in tailoring wave propagation and bandgap characteristics for a wide range of applications.

Characterizing phononic bandgaps and understanding wave propagation properties within phononic crystals necessitates the application of diverse experimental and computational techniques. Computational methods serve as indispensable tools for predicting band structures and simulating material behavior, often guiding experimental design and interpretation. The finite element method (FEM) is a widely adopted computational approach for calculating phononic band gaps [7], determining phonon dispersion, and analyzing thermal conductivity [23]. FEM calculations are also employed to obtain band-gap structures in generated samples, functioning as a computational characterization step in inverse design workflows [9], and are utilized to compute spatial distributions such as the amplitude of topological interface phonons and optical fields [22]. In some cases, FEM is combined with other techniques, such as the two-dimensional mode matching method and the transfer matrix method, to comprehensively characterize band structure and transmission loss [1]. Beyond continuum methods like FEM, atomistic approaches such as atomistic Green’s functions and ab initio-based Monte Carlo simulations are employed to characterize phonon transport and thermal conductivity, enabling the prediction and analysis of bandgap properties and thermal behavior at the nanoscale [27]. Similarly, first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations are utilized to predict material properties and characterize bandgap and wave propagation by computing band structures and transmission spectra [35]. Numerical analysis, in general, is crucial for tasks such as  

validating the robustness of topological states, like back-scattering immunity of edge states [6], and calculating band structures and field distributions [34].  

Experimental techniques are vital for validating the theoretical predictions and simulations, providing empirical evidence of bandgap existence and wave control capabilities [8,11,31]. While generalized transmission and reflection spectroscopy are fundamental for direct bandgap measurement, specific implementations vary depending on the frequency range and material system. Microwave experiments have been used to measure the attenuation of boundary modes in phononic structures, experimentally validating simulated phenomena [34]. Optical methods are also prevalent; for instance, light scattering experiments allow for the measurement of vibrations on phononic metacrystals [4]. Laser-ultrasonics, a nondestructive and high-throughput technique, enables the experimental demonstration of tunable elastic-wave velocities in microscale materials [2]. Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) offer a versatile experimental tool, utilized to investigate impactinduced transient responses and study slow flexural waves associated with defect modes in phononic crystal beams [15]. In some contexts, acoustic properties are inferred by fitting experimental results to theoretical models, allowing the extraction of parameters like Brillouin gain coefficients, dissipation rates, and coupling coefficients [20]. More specialized techniques, such as transient absorption spectroscopy, are employed to study related phenomena like carrier dynamics influenced by the phononic environment [10]. Characterization of related devices, such as resonators and antennas based on phononic principles, involves techniques like terahertz free-space measurements, refractive index measurements using prism couplers, numerical analysis of damping mechanisms (e.g., anchor loss, thermoelastic damping), and mass sensitivity measurements for sensing applications [37]. Furthermore, in quantum phononic systems, the qubit itself can serve as a sensor to probe interactions and infer changes in the phononic environment [3].  

The interplay between computational and experimental methods is a cornerstone of research in this field. Computational models provide predictive power and insights into the underlying physics, allowing for the design of sophisticated phononic structures and the calculation of properties like band structures, thermal conductivity, and optical field distributions [22,27,35]. However, the accuracy of these models is contingent on the precision of input parameters and the approximations made. Experimental techniques provide the necessary validation, confirming the existence and properties of predicted bandgaps and wave phenomena in physical realizations [8,11,31]. Computational methods excel at exploring vast design spaces and accessing parameters not easily measured experimentally, while experiments provide undeniable proof of concept in realistic conditions. Limitations of computational methods include computational cost for complex or large-scale systems and the challenge of accurately capturing all real-world imperfections. Experimental limitations often involve fabrication tolerances, challenges in precisely controlling environmental factors, and the difficulty in performing local or high-resolution measurements of certain acoustic properties. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of phononic bandgap engineering relies heavily on the synergistic application of both computational predictions and experimental validations.​

Bandgap engineering in phononic crystals (PnCs) provides a powerful methodology for controlling acoustic and elastic wave propagation, enabling a diverse array of applications across various domains. The fundamental principle relies on designing periodic structures that exhibit frequency bandgaps, within which wave propagation is strongly inhibited [1,21]. These bandgaps arise from mechanisms such as Bragg scattering, based on the periodic arrangement of materials or structures, and local resonance, stemming from resonant elements within the unit cell [35]. By tailoring the geometry, material properties, and periodicity of PnCs, researchers can precisely manipulate the frequency range, width, and depth of these bandgaps, as well as introduce defect or edge states that allow for localized or topologically protected wave propagation within the bandgaps [6,9]. This ability to custom-design wave behavior forms the theoretical framework underpinning their utility in numerous applications.  

One primary area is the control of wave propagation for acoustic waveguiding and filtering. By introducing linear defects within a PnC bulk structure exhibiting a bandgap, waves at frequencies within this gap can be confined and guided along the defect channel, enabling low-loss wave propagation [4,21]. Specific examples include h‑BN PnC waveguides operating in the RF range and metacrystal designs achieving anisotropic wave guidance [4,11]. Filtering is achieved by creating structures with bandgaps that block unwanted frequencies or introducing defect modes that act as highly selective frequency passbands or demultiplexers [2,21]. Recent advancements in topological phononics further enhance waveguiding robustness against defects and disorder by exploiting topological edge states [6,8,25].​  

Bandgap-engineered PnCs are also highly effective for vibration isolation and noise reduction. The broad attenuation provided by bandgaps, whether from Bragg scattering or local resonance, significantly reduces transmission of acoustic and elastic waves at targeted frequencies [1,35]. Applications range from noise reduction in piping systems and nuclear power plants to vibration isolation in structures subjected to dynamic loads and aerospace equipment [1,7,8,35]. Designs incorporating labyrinthine, fractal, bistable honeycomb, or star structures enable broadband and low-frequency isolation [13,24,30,35]. PnCs are also explored as surface wave barriers for seismic isolation [12,15].  

In acoustic sensing and imaging, PnCs leverage their sensitivity to external stimuli and the presence of localized modes. Changes in the surrounding medium or applied fields shift bandgap frequencies or alter defect mode characteristics, providing a sensing mechanism [35,37]. Examples include sensing solution concentrations using PnC or phoxonic crystal structures and the potential for structural health monitoring using PnC plates or integrated FBG sensors [6,15,35]. For imaging, PnCs and metamaterials can manipulate ultrasound waves and potentially achieve super-resolution imaging by controlling sub-wavelength fields [2,21].  

Furthermore, PnCs offer potential in energy harvesting and thermal management by controlling phonon transport [10]. In energy harvesting, strategic placement of defects in PnC structures can localize vibrational energy for efficient capture [15,35]. For thermal management, PnCs can significantly reduce thermal conductivity by creating bandgaps that impede phonon transport, crucial for enhancing thermoelectric device efficiency [23,27,30,36]. Controlling electron–phonon interactions via phonon management also shows promise for improving solar cell efficiency [10,38].  

Beyond these established areas, advanced and emerging applications leverage sophisticated bandgap engineering. Topological phononic crystals enable robust, defect-tolerant waveguiding and manipulation, offering protected transport mechanisms [6,8,13,24,25]. Quantum acoustics utilizes PnCs to control phonons for quantum computing, hybrid quantum systems, and quantum networks, including developing phononic circuits for signal transduction [3,4,20,22,25]. Acoustic cloaking, biomedical applications (ultrasound control), microparticle manipulation, and integrated signal processing platforms represent other burgeoning fields where PnC bandgap engineering is pivotal [2,8,11,13,21,25].  

Across these applications, key performance metrics such as bandwidth, insertion loss, attenuation depth, sensitivity, and robustness are directly tied to the engineered bandgap properties and the specific PnC design. Advantages over conventional technologies often include miniaturization, novel functionalities (e.g., topological protection, mode conversion), and the tailorability of response through design [2,6,21]. Current challenges involve achieving broad or lowfrequency bandgaps in compact structures, minimizing insertion losses, and scalable fabrication across different frequency regimes. Future directions are likely to focus on integrating advanced design techniques, such as machine learning for topology optimization, exploring complex multi-physics coupling, and translating fundamental demonstrations into practical, high-performance devices for quantum technologies, bioengineering, and advanced communication systems [5,12].​  

# 5.1 Acoustic Waveguiding and Filtering  

Phononic crystals (PnCs) leverage acoustic bandgaps to achieve precise control over wave propagation, enabling functionalities crucial for acoustic waveguiding and filtering applications. By creating structures where specific frequency ranges are forbidden to propagate, PnCs can confine waves within designed channels or selectively transmit or block frequencies—analogous to how electronic bandgaps enable semiconductors and insulators. Acoustic waveguiding is typically achieved by introducing linear defects (channels) within a PnC structure that lies in the bandgap of the bulk crystal [21]. These defects create localized modes within the bandgap, allowing waves at these frequencies to propagate along the defect channel while being inhibited from diffracting into the surrounding bulk PnC.​  

Various PnC designs have been explored for waveguiding and filtering. Metacrystals, for instance, have been designed to function as waveguides that permit vibrations along one axis while effectively blocking them in the perpendicular direction, demonstrating anisotropic wave control [4]. A specific implementation using h‑BN phononic crystal waveguides demonstrated the ability to confine and support wave propagation in the 15–24 MHz range over a distance of $1 . 2 \mathsf { m m }$ , showcasing their potential for radiofrequency acoustic applications [11].  

Recent advancements in topological acoustics have introduced novel paradigms for robust waveguiding. The observation of topological edge modes in sonic crystals suggests potential for waveguiding that is protected against defects and disorder [8]. Research on micro- and nanoscale topological phononic crystals emphasizes achieving precise control of elastic waves, directly relevant to robust acoustic waveguiding [25]. Designs supporting pseudospin-dependent one-way edge modes have enabled unidirectional robust propagation and multichannel waveguide switching, highlighting the enhanced functionality offered by topological protection [6]. Furthermore, studies on topological insulators and metasurfaces indicate the possibility of switchable asymmetric acoustic transmission, which has implications for dynamic waveguiding and filtering applications [8,13].  

Beyond simple guiding, PnCs facilitate advanced wave manipulation techniques. Research on efficient pure‑mode elastic mode‑converting diodes and full mode‑converting transmission between longitudinal and bending waves in plates and beams suggests that PnCs and metamaterials can be used to manipulate wave modes, which is critical for designing sophisticated waveguides and filters [30]. Examples include asymmetric full mode‑converting transmission of elastic waves and the use of mode‑converting meta‑slab wedges for ultrasonic flow measurement [30].  

For filtering applications, defect modes inserted within the PnC structure can lead to highly selective frequency filters and devices for wavelength demultiplexing [21]. By spatially and temporally tuning wave propagation velocities, PnCs can act as acoustic demultiplexers, separating a single input signal into multiple output signals based on frequency or velocity [2].  

When considering the performance of PnC waveguides and filters, key metrics include bandwidth, insertion loss, and robustness. Bandwidth refers to the range of frequencies that can be effectively guided or filtered. Insertion loss quantifies the signal attenuation during propagation through the device. Robustness describes the device’s resilience to fabrication imperfections or environmental variations. While specific, detailed comparisons of these metrics across various PnC designs and with conventional acoustic devices are often complex due to the diversity of PnC structures and operating frequencies, the h‑BN PnC waveguide study provided a frequency range (15–24 MHz) and propagation distance $( 1 . 2 \mathsf { m m } )$ [11]. Topological designs inherently offer enhanced robustness compared to bandgap‐confined waveguiding, providing protection against certain types of defects and disorder [6,8,25]. PnC‑based devices offer potential advantages over conventional acoustic filters and waveguides, such as smaller footprints, novel functionalities (e.g., topological robustness, mode conversion, asymmetric transmission), and tailorability of frequency response through structural design—although achieving low insertion loss and broad bandwidth simultaneously remains an active area of research.​  

# 5.2 Vibration Isolation and Noise Reduction  

Phononic crystals and metamaterials have emerged as promising candidates for effective vibration isolation and noise reduction across various applications. Their efficacy stems primarily from the presence of band gaps, frequency ranges within which wave propagation is strongly attenuated or prohibited [1]. Two primary mechanisms contribute to band gap formation and wave attenuation: Bragg scattering, arising from the periodic arrangement of structural components, and local resonance, achieved by incorporating resonant elements within the unit cell [35]. While band gaps are the dominant mechanism for wave suppression, studies confirm that the significant reduction in transmission is directly attributable to these band gaps, rather than phenomena like impedance mismatch alone [1].  

The performance of these structures is evaluated based on the width and depth of the attenuation bandwidth and overall efficiency. Research demonstrates that within the band gap, the transmission coefficient can decay exponentially with an increasing number of periodic units, indicating robust wave suppression [1]. Specific designs have achieved remarkable levels of attenuation; for instance, phononic crystal structures have been shown to significantly reduce environmental noise affecting quantum systems, decreasing the relaxation rate of SiV centers by 18 times using a 1D structure and extending TLS lifetimes by 10 times with a 2D configuration [3]. Beyond narrow‐band performance, broadband sound insulation has been achieved using intricate designs like labyrinthine and fractal acoustic metamaterials [24]. Low‐frequency vibration isolation is also a critical area, addressed by novel designs such as frog‐like meta‐structures employing linkage mechanisms [30] and improved double panels incorporating plate‐type acoustic metamaterials [35].​  

The versatility of phononic crystals and metamaterials enables their application in diverse scenarios requiring noise and vibration control. Examples include noise reduction in piping systems [1], vibration and noise mitigation in nuclear power plants [8], and vibration attenuation for structures subjected to dynamic loads—such as train loads—utilizing isolators based on locally resonant phononic crystals [35]. Furthermore, their potential extends to aerospace equipment, where improved vibration and noise reduction performance is crucial [7]. General structural elements like phononic crystal plates [6] and sandwich plates with periodic hollow tube cores [12] are also being explored for their vibration and noise control capabilities. Various metamaterial configurations, including bistable honeycomb, star structures, and porous materials [13,24], have been investigated for tunable vibration isolation and sound insulation.  

Effective surface wave barriers are another critical application area. Periodic structures, such as partially embedded periodic pile barriers, have been developed and analyzed for their effectiveness in attenuating surface waves, specifically Love waves and Rayleigh waves [12]. Similarly, inertant seismic metamaterials have demonstrated capabilities for broadband Rayleigh wave attenuation, providing solutions for seismic vibration isolation [15].​  

Optimizing the design of phononic crystals and metamaterials is crucial for maximizing their performance in vibration isolation and noise reduction. Advanced techniques, including deep learning, are increasingly employed for this purpose. For instance, deep learning can facilitate fast topology optimization of phononic crystal‐based metastructures, accelerating the design process for enhanced vibration isolation performance [12]. Such optimization approaches are instrumental in tailoring band gaps and resonant features to specific frequency ranges and desired attenuation levels, further improving the effectiveness of these materials in practical applications [24].  

# 5.3 Acoustic Sensing and Imaging  

The unique acoustic properties of phononic crystals—in particular, their sensitivity to external parameters and the presence of localized modes—enable their application in various sensing modalities. This sensitivity can be leveraged to detect changes in the surrounding medium or applied physical stimuli by observing shifts in bandgap frequencies or alterations in localized mode characteristics. Research has explored diverse sensing mechanisms based on these principles [35,37].  

Specific examples of phononic crystal or related acoustic/vibration-based sensing include the development of highperformance structures for detecting solution concentrations. Studies have focused on designs such as phononic crystal sensing structures for acetone solution concentration [35]. In addition, phoxonic crystal structures, which combine photonic and phononic bandgaps, have been investigated for high-sensitivity liquid concentration sensing, including designs utilizing slot nanobeams [35]. Variations such as phoxonic crystal nanobeams with lateral fins and slit-gradient phoxonic crystal sensors have also been explored for highly sensitive detection of solution concentrations [35].  

Beyond material property analysis, acoustic principles underpin sensors used for physiological monitoring and structural integrity assessment. For example, wearable devices employing low-cost piezoresistive sensors to monitor heart rate represent an application of vibration-based sensing [37]. In the realm of magnetometry, devices such as piezoelectric-onsilicon MEMS Lorentz force lateral field magnetometers and Lamb wave mode biconvex piezoelectric Lorentz force magnetometers have been discussed, illustrating the relevance of acoustic principles in detecting magnetic fields via induced vibrations [37]. The potential application of phononic crystal plates in structural damage detection and nondestructive testing of materials further highlights their utility in assessing the integrity of structures [6].  

Leveraging acoustic wave manipulation, phononic structures are also being explored for imaging applications. There is potential for creating microscale devices and components that are useful for ultrasound imaging [2], while acoustic metamaterial lenses offer the promise of achieving superior imaging resolution compared to conventional lenses, due to their ability to manipulate sub-wavelength evanescent fields [21].  

Integrated sensing systems—such as those combining phononic structures with established sensor technologies—offer promising capabilities. For instance, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors, widely applied in structural health monitoring, can potentially be integrated with phononic crystal structures to enhance their ability to detect subtle changes in material or structural integrity [15]. This integration could lead to more sophisticated and sensitive systems for monitoring the health and performance of materials and structures.​  

# 5.4 Energy Harvesting and Thermal Management  

Phononic crystals (PnCs) present significant opportunities in the fields of energy harvesting and thermal management by offering precise control over phonon transport [10]. The ability to tailor acoustic and thermal properties through bandgap engineering enables diverse applications, from converting waste energy into usable forms to efficiently managing heat flow in advanced devices.​  

In the realm of energy harvesting, PnCs demonstrate potential for capturing acoustic or vibrational energy. Research has explored achieving highly localized and efficient energy harvesting in PnC structures, such as beams, through the strategic placement of defects [15]. Defect states within the phononic bandgap can localize vibrational energy, facilitating its capture and conversion. Furthermore, studies on novel two-dimensional three-component piezoelectric phononic crystal plates have investigated defect states and their role in vibration energy recovery, highlighting the relevance of material composition and structure in enhancing harvesting efficiency [35].  

Thermal management is another critical area where PnCs excel. By engineering phononic bandgaps, phonon transport can be significantly impeded, leading to a reduction in thermal conductivity [23,30]. This is particularly crucial for improving the efficiency of thermoelectric materials and devices [27,32,36]. Thermoelectric devices rely on a large temperature gradient to generate electricity, which is maximized by materials possessing low thermal conductivity alongside high electrical conductivity [27]. PnCs, such as nanoscale 3D structures, can create complete bandgaps that suppress phonon transport across a range of frequencies, thereby reducing thermal conductivity without necessarily degrading electrical transport significantly [23]. Studies indicate that increasing the mass ratio between components within a PnC structure can effectively lower thermal conductivity [23]. While the primary focus derived from the provided digests is on reducing thermal conductivity for applications like thermoelectrics, the fundamental principle of bandgap engineering also allows for the potential enhancement of thermal conductivity by designing structures that facilitate specific phonon modes for efficient heat dissipation, although specific PnC examples for enhancedthermal transport for heat dissipation were not detailed in the digests.​  

Phonon management techniques also extend to enhancing solar energy harvesting. One approach involves improving the efficiency of solar cells by manipulating hot carrier relaxation processes [10]. By managing phonon modes and electronacoustic coupling, researchers aim to extract and utilize the energy from hot carriers before it is lost to heat through lattice vibrations [10]. Furthermore, the control over acoustic properties can potentially be utilized to improve light-matter interaction in solar energy systems, optimizing light absorption and subsequent energy conversion processes [38].  

In summary, the precise control over phonon band structures afforded by phononic crystals provides powerful tools for acoustic and vibrational energy harvesting through mechanisms like defect-induced localization [15], and for thermal management applications, notably by reducing thermal conductivity essential for efficient thermoelectric conversion [23,27,36]. The capacity to manipulate electron-phonon interactions further positions PnCs as valuable structures for improving the efficiency of energy conversion devices, including solar cells [10].  

# 5.5 Advanced and Emerging Applications  

Bandgap engineering in phononic crystals facilitates a diverse range of advanced and emerging applications that extend beyond conventional acoustic filtering and control. A significant area of research focuses on harnessing the concept of topological protection in phononic crystals. This approach enables the creation of robust waveguides and devices that are inherently resilient to defects and disorder, ensuring reliable wave propagation even in the presence of structural imperfections [6,8]. Studies have explored sub-wavelength topological boundary states, selective topological valley transport, and dual-band elastic topological edge states in phononic crystal plates, demonstrating the potential for precisely controlling elastic wave pathways [35]. Topological acoustic insulators, including those based on chiral spiral acoustic metamaterials and composite honeycomb structures, represent robust platforms for wave manipulation [24]. The design of topological phononic crystals specifically for robust waveguiding underscores their utility in creating protected wave devices [6,25]. Topological phononic crystals, alongside valley vortex-assisted microparticle manipulation and acoustic cloaking, are recognized as key advanced applications [13].  

The emerging field of quantum acoustics represents another frontier where phononic crystals are poised to play a transformative role [3,25]. Phononic crystals can manipulate phonons, the quantum of acoustic vibration, for applications in quantum computing [3,4]. This includes the potential to enhance qubit interactions and significantly improve qubit performance and information conversion efficiency [3,4]. Furthermore, phononic crystals are crucial components in hybrid quantum systems, facilitating the coupling of phonons with other quantum carriers such as photons, magnons, and spins [3]. They are also considered vital for building quantum networks and communication devices [3,4]. Specifically, phononic circuits are being investigated for their potential as translators between superconducting qubit microwave signals and optical frequencies, a critical capability for long-distance quantum communication [3]. The potential for integrated quantum optomechanics and quantum information processing using phononic-plasmonic nanocavities has also been highlighted [20,22].​  

Acoustic cloaking, which aims to render an object undetectable to sound waves, is achievable using phononic crystals by carefully designing structures that redirect incoming waves around the target object [13,21]. Research exploring acoustic cloaking principles and implementations demonstrates its potential as an advanced application of sonic and phononic crystals [8].​  

Beyond these areas, phononic crystals hold promise for biomedical applications. They can be employed to precisely control ultrasound waves, opening avenues for targeted therapies, such as drug delivery or tissue ablation, and enhancing the capabilities of medical imaging [2].  

Other emerging applications of bandgap-engineered phononic crystals include valley vortex-assisted microparticle manipulation [8,13], microwave-to-optical and terahertz-light conversion and transduction [22,37]. Guiding and manipulating acoustic waves on platforms like h-BN facilitates multiphysical coupling and information transduction, potentially enabling coherent on-chip signal processing and communication [11,25]. Phononic crystals are also being explored for mechanical computing [2], spintronics, microwave photonics [25], and CMOS-compatible mechanical devices [20]. Novel applications such as mimicking wormholes using elastic waves in curved space further illustrate the breadth of possibilities [8]. Research into origami metamaterials also indicates potential for advanced wave manipulation applications [15]. These diverse applications highlight the significant and expanding impact of bandgap-engineered phononic crystals across various scientific and technological domains.​  

# 6. Challenges and Future Directions  

![](images/334ac8e4d740ff3cc51525ee3385ba74d8a4a9427145fc6c8b02e284b74e5e5d.jpg)  

Despite significant progress in the field of phononic crystals (PCs), several key challenges must be addressed to translate fundamental research into widespread practical applications. A primary obstacle lies in the fabrication of intricate and complex structures, particularly in three dimensions and at the nanoscale [8,13,27]. Realizing experimental structures at submicron and nanometer scales operating in the GHz range presents significant technological difficulties [21], and miniaturizing and characterizing acoustic metamaterials at high frequencies remains challenging [2]. Furthermore, the transformation of micro/nano-structured materials with precisely controllable wave propagation capabilities into functional materials suitable for real-world use is identified as a key challenge [28,33]. Current artificial structure units are often highly sensitive to defects and external interference, which hinders their practical deployment [28,33]. The development of lowcost, large-scale fabrication techniques for these complex structures is critically needed [8].​  

The impact of material properties on device performance poses another challenge. Acoustic losses within constituent materials can degrade the quality factor (Q) of PC structures, limiting their efficacy, particularly in resonant applications [22]. The sensitivity of resonant frequencies to environmental conditions and fabrication errors also presents difficulties, necessitating compensation strategies such as active control of mechanical oscillators [20]. Optimizing material properties for specific applications is crucial for enhancing performance [30].​  

Achieving broadband and dynamically tunable bandgaps is a persistent goal. While significant progress has been made, designing structures that offer wide operational bandwidths and are dynamically controllable remains challenging [13,21]. Incorporating external physical stimuli like electric or magnetic fields, tensile strain, temperature variations, or phase transformations, and utilizing materials like shape memory alloys, offers pathways towards tunable and reversible PCs [7,21]. Achieving greater tunability can also involve designing structures with higher-order responses [20]. Furthermore, obtaining bandgaps at low frequencies for applications like vibration isolation presents specific design challenges [30].  

The integration of phononic crystals with other technologies represents both a challenge and a significant opportunity. Seamlessly integrating PCs into existing structures for real-world applications requires careful design and material selection [15]. There is growing interest in leveraging multiphysical coupling to integrate phononic functions with other wave systems, such as applying principles from photonic bandgap materials (FBICs) to PCs [34]. The potential for multiphysical coupling and information transduction using PC waveguides, particularly with materials like h-BN, suggests future directions in coherent on-chip signal processing and communication via integrated photonic and phononic devices [11]. Integrating PCs with quantum systems also introduces challenges related to managing multi-physics coupling and ensuring lowtemperature compatibility [3].​  

Significant challenges also lie in advancing design methodologies and computational modeling. Accurately manipulating acoustic and elastic waves requires sophisticated design approaches [9]. Traditional design methods are often characterized by low efficiency and may not yield optimal performance [5,9]. Computing the band structure of PCs is difficult due to the need to effectively capture complex geometries and jump conditions at material interfaces [19]. Density-based topology optimization methods face challenges with staircased boundaries, necessitating heavily refined and computationally expensive meshes [18]. The coexistence and coupling of different types of wave modes (longitudinal, transverse, Lamb waves, surface acoustic waves) in structures like plates add complexity to design efforts, particularly for topological devices [6,25,30]. The challenge of selecting appropriate parameters and ensuring computational efficiency also exists in meshless methods like RBF collocation [31].  

Looking ahead, promising future research directions focus on overcoming these challenges. This includes the exploratio of novel materials [8,13,27], such as h-BN for integrated devices [11], and novel metamaterial designs [30]. Developing new structures, including advanced topological structures and potentially non-Hermitian systems, is also a key area [13]. The advancement of design methodologies is crucial, with increasing focus on integrating AI-based methods for materials design [5,13]. Machine learning, including ANN-based inverse design, offers a potential solution to the limitations of traditional design approaches, enabling rapid and automatic exploration of complex structures beyond human intuition [4,5,9]. Developing more accurate and efficient computational design techniques, such as level set-based methods and improved RBF collocation methods, is essential for overcoming simulation challenges [18,27,31]. Furthermore, the development of sophisticated multiphysics and multiscale modeling techniques is critical for accurately predicting and optimizing phononic crystal behavior, especially when considering coupling with other physical phenomena [3,13,15]. Future applications may involve creating acoustic integrated chip materials and devices, possibly utilizing materials like lithium niobate-based topological phononic crystals [25], developing phononic-based quantum computing [3], and optimizing designs for specific applications like noise suppression in piping systems [1].​  

# 7. Conclusion

Researchers have developed diverse strategies to precisely control acoustic and elastic wave propagation, leveraging mechanisms such as Bragg scattering and local resonance [1]. Notably, advancements in harnessing topological properties have enabled robust waveguiding and the realization of topologically protected elastic edge states, offering immunity to structural defects [6,8]. Simultaneously, significant strides have been made in tailoring phononic crystal structures for specific applications, including the design of nanoscale 3D structures for thermal conductivity reduction [23,27] and the development of pipes with expansion chambers for effective noise control in piping systems [1].​  

The ability to engineer these bandgaps is paramount for enabling advanced acoustic devices and systems across a wide spectrum of fields. Phononic crystals are proving instrumental in applications ranging from noise and vibration isolation [8,13,30] to acoustic waveguiding, filtering, and focusing [4,11,30]. Their unique properties are also being explored for thermal management [23,27,30], particle manipulation [13], ultrasound imaging, and even mechanical computing [2]. Furthermore, the integration of phononic engineering concepts shows immense potential for breakthroughs in nascent fields such as quantum acoustics, quantum computing, and high-performance optomechanical systems [3,22,25].  

Despite these remarkable achievements, challenges remain in the field. Translating fundamental research into scalable and robust practical applications continues to be a key hurdle [28,33]. Issues such as sensitivity to manufacturing imperfections and defects, particularly in complex or nanoscale designs, need to be effectively addressed [28]. Overcoming the limitations of traditional design methods is also essential for accelerating the discovery of novel structures with desired properties [5].  

Future research directions are poised to tackle these challenges and unlock further potential. The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques offers powerful tools for the inverse design and optimization of phononic crystals, enabling efficient identification of structures with targeted bandgaps [4,5,8,9,13]. Advancements in topology optimization methods, such as level set-based approaches [18], are crucial for designing complex geometries with enhanced performance. The exploration of novel materials, including smart materials like shape memory alloys for active bandgap tuning [7], and new material platforms such as h-BN and lithium niobate [11,25], represents promising avenues for expanding the functional capabilities of phononic devices. Continued efforts towards developing robust, defect-tolerant, and scalable designs are critical for the successful translation of research findings into tangible technologies [28].  

In conclusion, bandgap engineering in phononic crystals is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field. Continued advancements in design methodologies, material science, and fabrication techniques—particularly when coupled with data-driven approaches—hold the key to overcoming existing limitations and realizing the full potential of these artificial materials. The ongoing exploration of phononic phenomena promises to yield transformative technologies with profound impacts across diverse sectors, from communications and computing to energy and environmental control.
