0. Natural Language to Code Generation with Large Language Models  

# 1. Introduction  

Natural Language to Code Generation (NL2Code) is a rapidly evolving field within artificial intelligence that aims to automate the creation of executable code directly from descriptions provided in natural language [5,16]. This technology is of paramount importance as it promises to significantly lower the barrier to programming, enhance production efficiency, and fundamentally transform the software development lifecycle [15,16].​  

Traditionally, programming is a knowledge-intensive activity that demands extensive domain expertise and coding experience [16], with manual coding often proving inefficient and error-prone [16]. AI-assisted programming emerged to address these issues by helping developers write code more efficiently, thereby improving productivity and quality [2]. Early methods in code generation typically relied on rule-based or template-based approaches, which required considerable manual design and intervention [16]. More recently, AI-assisted programming has evolved to include techniques such as code completion and the automatic generation or modification of code based on user input [2].  

The field is currently undergoing a significant paradigm shift, moving beyond mere “assisted programming” towards “full-stack generation” or even fully autonomous AI development teams [9,10]. This transformation is largely driven by breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) [9]. Predictions suggest a substantial impact on workflows and developer roles; for instance, Gartner's 2024 technology maturity curve indicates that AI code generation is entering a period of productivity explosion and is expected to cover $4 5 \%$ of enterprise-level development scenarios by 2026 [9], while some forecasts even predict that AI systems will have programming capabilities comparable to those of intermediate engineers in the near future [9].​  

Large Language Models have revolutionized the NL2Code field by enabling a new data-driven approach [16]. Unlike traditional methods, LLMs are trained on massive corpora that combine code with natural language, allowing them to master the complex mapping between programming languages and natural language, and to generate code based on descriptive inputs [16]. The emergence of powerful generative models for text and image synthesis has further highlighted the increasing applications of AI-generated content across various domains, including code [14]. LLMs exhibit remarkable performance on a variety of tasks, including code generation [1], leveraging their deep understanding of linguistic patterns and contextual semantics [2]. This has led numerous technology companies and research institutions to report encouraging results when applying LLMs to coding tasks [16].  

Despite these advancements and promising benchmark performances, a significant gap remains between these achievements and the practical applicability of LLMs in real-world programming scenarios. This gap is partly due to the reliance on pre-existing libraries and external knowledge [11,36]. Challenges in practical code generation include the cost of updating internal knowledge bases and the risk of generating erroneous or fabricated outputs (hallucinations) [36]. Furthermore, evaluating the capabilities of code LLMs presents challenges that require multi-dimensional assessments to ensure outputs are helpful, harmless, and truthful, particularly in complex enterprise scenarios or conversational products [8]. In addition, there are common limitations in current code generation benchmarks and assessment methods [8,23].  

Opportunities in this field include the exploration of retrieval-augmented generation techniques [36] and the integration of perspectives from both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Software Engineering (SE) [32,37].  

Given the rapid evolution of NL2Code facilitated by LLMs, the significant predicted impact on software development, and the existing research challenges and opportunities, a comprehensive survey is both timely and necessary [5,14,17,37]. This survey aims to provide a systematic review of the field, covering key aspects such as data management, recent model advancements, performance evaluation methodologies, and practical applications of LLMs in code generation [37]. By presenting a systematic literature review and highlighting both challenges and opportunities, this work intends to offer  

valuable references for researchers and bridge the gap between academic research and practical developments in this dynamic domain.  

# 2. Background on LLMs and Code Generation  

Large Language Models (LLMs) represent advanced Artificial Intelligence frameworks that utilize deep learning, particularly neural networks and self-attention mechanisms, to process and generate human-like text [17,28,38]. Trained on massive text datasets, these models exhibit remarkable capabilities across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, translation, and question answering [1,25,38]. Significantly, LLMs have demonstrated emergent abilities extending beyond core linguistic functions, notably including code generation [1,17,38,42].​  

The foundational architecture underlying many successful LLMs is the Transformer [17,22,28]. Departing from traditional recurrent or convolutional structures, the Transformer relies on the self-attention mechanism, enabling it to capture longrange dependencies within sequences [26,28,34]. This mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different tokens regardless of their distance, a crucial feature for understanding both natural language and the structured nature of code [28,34]. The architecture commonly adopts a sequence-to-sequence structure, comprising an encoder to process input (natural language) and a decoder to generate output (code), which is particularly significant for sequence-to-sequence tasks like code generation [2,26,33]. Positional encoding is integrated to preserve sequential information despite the parallel nature of self-attention [34].  

The capabilities of LLMs are largely a result of their extensive pre-training on vast datasets [17,28,30]. Pre-training objectives, such as masked language modeling (MLM) or causal language modeling (CLM), are designed to enable models to learn general language representations and patterns [26,28,34]. For tasks like code generation, pre-training often includes large code corpora alongside natural language data, allowing models to acquire specific knowledge about programming languages, syntax, and common coding patterns [12,22].  

![](images/838c5ef697a363999257be1bb0ac42e3fddd5834f1b4ed8499910eeadd2cb402.jpg)  

While pre-training builds broad capabilities, fine-tuning on task-specific datasets (e.g., natural language prompts paired with corresponding code) is typically employed to adapt the pre-trained models to the specific requirements of code generation, enhancing their performance on this downstream task [25,28,30,34].  

Code generation, in the context of AI-assisted programming, refers to the automatic completion, modification, or creation of code based on user input or descriptions [2,15]. While traditional methods for code generation existed, LLM-based approaches have become prominent due to their ability to understand complex natural language instructions and generate more nuanced and contextually relevant code [5]. This transformation relies fundamentally on NLP techniques, such as semantic parsing to interpret the meaning of natural language instructions and context understanding to relate instructions to existing code or documentation, enabling the translation of natural language into executable code [5,6]. LLMs, through their learned representations and attention mechanisms, are particularly well-suited to capturing the semantic and structural relationships necessary for this complex translation process.​  

# 2.1 Transformer Architecture  

The Transformer architecture constitutes the foundational framework for numerous Large Language Models (LLMs) employed in the domain of natural language to code generation [17,22,28]. This architecture is primarily characterized by its reliance on self-attention mechanisms, departing from traditional recurrent or convolutional structures [26,28].  

A common configuration of the Transformer is the sequence-to-sequence model, which comprises an encoder and a decoder [2,26,33]. The encoder processes the input sequence, such as a natural language description, transforming it into a contextualized continuous vector representation [26,33]. The decoder then utilizes this representation to generate the target sequence, which is the code, typically in an autoregressive manner, predicting the next token based on the encoder output and the previously generated tokens [22,26,33]. Both the encoder and decoder consist of a stack of identical layers [26]. For instance, the encoder typically contains $N$ layers (often $N = 6$ ), each comprising a multi-head self-attention sub-layer and a position-wise feed-forward neural network sub-layer [26]. Decoder layers similarly contain a masked multi-head selfattention sub-layer, an encoder-decoder attention sub-layer, and a feed-forward network sub-layer [26]. Each sub-layer is commonly followed by a residual connection and layer normalization to enhance training stability and convergence speed, calculated as​  

$$
\mathrm { o u t p u t } = \mathrm { L a y e r N o r m } { \big ( } x + \mathrm { S u b L a y e r } ( x ) { \big ) }
$$  

[26].  

The core mechanism enabling the Transformer's capabilities is the self-attention mechanism [28,34]. Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in the input sequence when processing each individual token, enabling it to consider global context rather than being limited by local dependencies [28]. This capability is particularly crucial for capturing long-range dependencies, which are prevalent in both natural language descriptions and complex code structures [34]. Multi-head self-attention extends this by running the attention mechanism multiple times in parallel with different learned linear projections, allowing the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions [2,26]. The fundamental attention calculation can be represented as:​  

$$
A t t e n t i o n ( Q , K , V ) = \sum _ { i } \alpha _ { i } K _ { i } V _ { i }
$$  

where $Q , K$ , and $V$ are the query, key, and value matrices derived from the input, and $\alpha _ { i }$ represents the attention weight assigned to the $\mathbf { \chi } _ { i }$ -th key-value pair [2]. Following the attention mechanism, feed-forward neural networks are applied independently to each position, performing non-linear transformations on the attended information through layers such as:  

$$
F ( x ) = h { \Big ( } W _ { 2 } h { \big ( } W _ { 1 } x + b _ { 1 } { \big ) } + b _ { 2 } { \Big ) }
$$  

where $h$ is a non-linear activation function, and $W _ { 1 }$ ​ , $W _ { 2 }$ ​ , $b _ { 1 }$ , and $b _ { 2 }$ ​ are learned weights and biases [2].  

Since the self-attention mechanism processes tokens in parallel without inherent regard for their sequential order, positional encoding is incorporated into the input embeddings to inject information about the absolute or relative position of tokens in the sequence [34]. This preserves the sequential information necessary for understanding the structure of both natural language instructions and the generated code [34].  

The design of the Transformer, particularly the self-attention mechanism, facilitates significant parallel processing, as computations for different parts of the sequence can be performed simultaneously [26]. This characteristic, combined with its scalability in model size and data handling, makes the Transformer architecture well-suited for training on large datasets and generating complex code structures, which are typical requirements in modern natural language to code generation tasks [26]. For instance, CodeGeeX, a multilingual code generation model, is built upon the Transformer architecture, featuring 40 transformer layers and 13 billion parameters, demonstrating the scalability of this design for handling extensive code generation tasks [22]. CodeGeeX utilizes a left-to-right autoregressive decoder specifically designed for predicting code tokens based on natural language input and preceding code tokens [22].​  

# 2.2 Pre-training and Fine-tuning Strategies  

The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Natural Language to Code (NL2Code) generation is fundamentally influenced by their pre-training objectives and subsequent fine-tuning strategies. Pre-training typically involves training models on vast datasets to acquire foundational language understanding and the emergence of complex reasoning abilities such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Plan of Thought (PoT), which are affected by the characteristics of the pre-training data [17]. General language models like GPT are pre-trained on extensive text datasets to capture overarching language structure and semantics [34]. Multilingual pre-trained models, such as M-BERT, employ objectives like the masked language model (MLM) task on corpora from numerous languages to learn universal representations necessary for cross-language transfer [26].​  

For code generation, pre-training specifically on code corpora is crucial for models to understand code syntax, semantics, and context. Models like CodeGeeX demonstrate this by being pre-trained on large code datasets covering multiple programming languages, incorporating language-specific prefixes to aid in language distinction [22]. This domain-specific pre-training allows the model to internalize programming language structures and patterns. Furthermore, specialized pretraining objectives, such as experimenting with separating embedding spaces between modalities through modalityrelative training, can be explored during further pre-training phases specifically for text-to-code generation tasks [12].  

While effective pre-training equips models with broad capabilities and knowledge [30], fine-tuning is essential to adapt these pre-trained LLMs to the specific requirements of downstream tasks like code generation [28,34]. Fine-tuning involves updating the model's parameters using gradient descent on task-specific datasets with relevant labels, contrasting with tuning-free or training-free paradigms like in-context learning [30]. This process specializes the model's knowledge and improves its performance on the target task.  

Different strategies exist for adapting models. While instruction tuning is a recognized approach, the use of domain-specific data is prominent in both pre-training and fine-tuning phases for tasks like code generation. Pre-training on a combination of domain-specific data (e.g., financial text for BloombergGPT [5] or code for CodeGeeX [22]) and generic data allows models to acquire both general capabilities and domain expertise. Fine-tuning LLMs with datasets comprising natural language prompts paired with corresponding code significantly enhances their ability to perform NL2Code tasks [28]. This domainspecific adaptation through fine-tuning on code datasets enables the models to better understand the nuances of generating syntactically correct and semantically appropriate code from natural language descriptions. The provided materials do not detail the application of reinforcement learning to optimize code generation metrics such as correctness, efficiency, or readability.​  

# 3. LLM Architectures and Models for Code Generation  

Large Language Models employed in natural language to code generation (NL2Code) utilize various transformer-based architectures, broadly categorized into Encoder, Decoder, Encoder-Decoder, and UniLM structures [32]. These architectural choices significantly influence their suitability and performance for different code generation tasks.  

Encoder-decoder models, common in neural machine translation (NMT) tasks, are capable of processing input sequences and generating output sequences by first encoding the source information and then decoding the target [20,26]. While historically used for sequence-to-sequence problems which can model code generation, the field has seen a strong inclination towards decoder-only models for generative tasks, including NL2Code. Decoder-only models operate in a left-toright autoregressive manner, predicting the next token based on the preceding sequence. This architecture is particularly effective for generating free-form code from a natural language prompt and excels at tasks like code completion and synthesis [22]. Their strength lies in their ability to model large-scale language distributions, essential for producing fluent and syntactically correct code.​  

Prominent examples of decoder-only models widely used in or adapted for code generation include the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) series, such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and the anticipated GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 [3,10,17,25,40]. These models are notable for their extensive pre-training on vast text corpora, which, when combined with fine-tuning or adaptation on code data, enables robust code generation capabilities [21]. For instance, GPT models have demonstrated significant achievements in various natural language processing tasks [34] and show promising, albeit sometimes limited, success on code-related benchmarks like ML-Bench and HumanEval [3,11]. The GPT architecture, specifically, has served as the foundation for models like OpenAI Codex, which powers prominent AI coding assistants [15]. Other significant decoderonly models include the LLaMA family, such as Llama 4 which incorporates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture and supports large context windows [17,40], and Claude models like Claude Instant and Claude 3, which have been utilized for tasks such as code completion despite encountering challenges like latency or sensitivity to prompt variations [10,19].

training objectives tailored to code, such as predicting masked tokens in code or understanding code structure, which contributes to improved code generation quality and accuracy compared to models without code-specific pre-training. Domain-specific models, like BloombergGPT optimized for financial tasks, illustrate the potential benefits of tailoring pretraining data and objectives for particular domains, a concept applicable to code generation in specialized areas [5].

Large Language Models serve as the foundational technology powering a wide array of AI code generation tools and platforms that aim to assist developers and improve productivity [4,29,39]. Tools like GitHub Copilot (leveraging GPT/Codex) [15,21], Amazon CodeWhisperer [39], Tabnine [39], JetBrains AI Assistant [29], and Cursor [29], among others including Cody (using Claude Instant) [19], employ these sophisticated models to generate code snippets, suggest completions, and even provide full functions or classes based on natural language prompts or surrounding code context. Their effectiveness stems from the LLMs' capacity to understand the user's intent expressed in natural language, comprehend the structural and contextual nuances of the existing codebase, and generate syntactically correct and contextually relevant code [39]. These tools demonstrate a spectrum of capabilities, ranging from basic code completion (L1) to advanced functions like autonomous code generation and full workflow automation (L5), showcasing the evolving role of LLMs in transforming software development practices [10]. Evaluations highlight that while models like GPT-4 achieve notable success rates on benchmarks, there remains significant room for improvement in handling complex coding tasks and adapting to diverse coding styles and requirements [11].​  

# 4. Techniques and Strategies for NL2Code  

![](images/ed2c93028951a47cd0bfbeac23b87dd91fe0b2aa7e85ac121f03bfc2fda1a6c1.jpg)  

Effective natural language to code (NL2Code) generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) relies on a suite of sophisticated techniques and strategies applied across the entire generation pipeline. This section provides an overview of the primary methods employed to enhance the accuracy, quality, diversity, and efficiency of code generated by LLMs, encompassing input preparation, output generation, and post-processing refinement.​  

A foundational aspect of controlling LLM behavior for code generation is Prompt Engineering. This involves carefully crafting input instructions and context to steer the model towards desired outputs [18,25]. Key strategies include In-context Learning, which leverages information within the prompt itself [30]. This encompasses techniques like Zero-shot Learning, relying on the model's pre-training without examples [8,18], and Few-shot Learning, which incorporates a small number of input-output examples to tailor the generation [8,18,22,30]. More advanced strategies such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Plan of Thought (PoT) aim to guide the model's reasoning process for complex tasks [8,17]. The design principles for effective prompts emphasize specificity, context definition, consistent language, and an appropriate balance of length and detail [10,16,25]. Incorporating contextual information from the surrounding code environment, such as coding comments or editor state, is also crucial for generating contextually relevant code [6,19]. Techniques like structured tags or constraints, as facilitated by languages like LMQL, further refine prompt-driven generation [1].​  

Following the model's internal processing, Decoding Strategies are employed to convert the predicted probability distributions over tokens into a concrete code sequence [33]. This sequential process involves trade-offs between code quality, diversity, and computational efficiency [34]. Common methods include Greedy Search, which selects the highest probability token at each step for computational efficiency but risks local optima [1,34]. Beam Search explores multiple probable sequences simultaneously, potentially yielding higher quality but at increased computational cost proportional to the beam size [1,34]. Random Sampling introduces stochasticity by sampling from the probability distribution, promoting diversity, with the temperature parameter controlling the level of randomness and its impact on accuracy versus creativity [1,3,34].​  

The fundamental step of representing both natural language and code for LLM processing involves converting raw text into tokens and then into vector Embeddings [28,33,34]. Various tokenization methods exist, including sub-word techniques lik BPE, which manage vocabulary size effectively [22,28,33]. Embeddings capture semantic and syntactic information, with methods ranging from traditional word embeddings to contextual embeddings, enabling efficient processing [28,33,34]. Beyond token embeddings, incorporating explicit syntactic structure (e.g., parse trees via Tree-sitter) and deep semantic relationships (e.g., cross-lingual code semantic graphs or leveraging code comments) is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of code [19,36]. Furthermore, Modality-relative Pre-training explores separating embedding spaces for natural language and programming language tokens to better capture their distinct semantics, particularly for programming keywords [12].​  

Ensuring the correctness and quality of generated code necessitates Code Refinement strategies. These include applying standard software engineering practices like static analysis to detect errors without execution, formal verification using mathematical methods to prove correctness, and dynamic testing by executing the code with varied inputs [3]. Techniques like type-aware mutation and the use of program contracts (e.g., assertions) are employed to generate robust test inputs and clarify requirements, improving the effectiveness of testing in evaluating code generation quality [3].​  

To overcome limitations in the LLM's parametric knowledge, Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation integrates external information retrieval systems [11,17,36]. This involves retrieving relevant code snippets, documentation, or contextual information to augment the input provided to the LLM, thereby enhancing accuracy and context-awareness [11]. Approaches range from retrieving localized editor context using similarity search [19] to constructing and encoding crosslingual code semantic graphs to leverage transferred programming knowledge across languages [36]. The retrieved information is then incorporated into the generation process, either by combining encoded representations or providing it directly as conditioning input to the LLM [11,19,36].​  

Collectively, these techniques—ranging from input manipulation via prompt engineering, output generation control through decoding strategies, sophisticated code representation methods, post-generation refinement, external knowledge integration, to modality-specific pre-training considerations—form the technical foundation for advancing NL2Code generation capabilities with LLMs. Ongoing research focuses on optimizing the interplay between these strategies and addressing challenges related to semantic accuracy, handling complex requirements, generating efficient and secure code, and developing robust evaluation methodologies.  

# 4.1 Prompt Engineering  

Prompt engineering serves as a critical technique for steering the behavior of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of natural language to code generation [18]. It involves designing inputs to elicit desired outputs from the model without requiring explicit fine-tuning of its parameters [30].  

Different prompting strategies offer varying levels of effectiveness and data requirements.  

![](images/6c7ad083efecddd189b26787d5e50c4afc9d3eee224cc8df12447c9867abb7fb.jpg)  

In-context learning is a foundational concept where models leverage contextual information provided in the prompt, such as instructions or examples, to improve performance [30]. This encompasses techniques like zero-shot and few-shot learning. Zero-shot learning relies solely on the model's pre-training knowledge and the task description within the prompt, requiring no specific examples. Few-shot learning, conversely, incorporates a small number of input-output examples directly into the prompt. This approach allows models like CodeGeeX to customize their output, imitating the provided examples for tasks such as generating code in specific styles, explaining code snippets, or summarizing functions [22]. While zero-shot learning is data-efficient in terms of prompt construction, few-shot learning demonstrates enhanced effectiveness for tailoring generation to specific requirements or learning particular patterns from the examples provided in the prompt [22]. More advanced prompting strategies, such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Plan of Thought (PoT), further guide the model's internal reasoning process, which can be beneficial for complex code generation tasks, and their emergence is influenced by pre-training data [17].​  

The design of the prompt significantly impacts the quality and correctness of the generated code [16]. General principles for effective prompt design emphasize specificity, defining the relevant context, using consistent language and terminology aligning with the desired output, and carefully balancing prompt length with the level of detail required [10,25]. Generic or underspecified prompts, such as merely asking for "a sorting algorithm", yield less precise results compared to detailed prompts specifying the programming language, algorithm type, constraints, and optimization goals, like "use Java to implement a non-recursive quick sort, requiring optimization of memory usage for $1 0 ^ { \land } 6$ data volume" [4].  

Beyond explicit instructions, incorporating contextual information from the surrounding code environment enhances generation quality. For instance, GitHub Copilot utilizes coding comments to understand developer intent, leading to more accurate and context-aware code suggestions [6]. Specific prompt engineering techniques can further refine output. Techniques used with models like Claude Instant include employing structured tags (e.g., XML tags) for code segments, managing whitespace strategically, and providing information about the code afterthe cursor to support "Fill in the Middle" scenarios [19]. Structuring prompts to include problem definitions and demonstration inputs can also enable tasks like generating high-quality test inputs for code evaluation by leveraging the model's understanding of formats and functionalities [3]. Automating multi-part prompting and applying constraints during the generation process, as explored in systems like LMQL, can improve accuracy and enable more robust, unsupervised application across different inputs [1]. These examples collectively illustrate that meticulous prompt design, incorporating detailed requirements, contextual cues, and structural elements, is paramount for achieving high-quality and correct code generation using LLMs.  

# 4.2 Decoding Strategies  

Decoding is a critical step in large language models for natural language to code generation, converting the model's output probabilities into a concrete sequence of tokens that form the final code [33]. This process is inherently sequential, with each generated token influencing the probability distribution of the subsequent tokens [33]. Various decoding strategies exist, offering distinct trade-offs between the quality, diversity, and computational efficiency of the generated code.​  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Strategy</td><td>Description</td><td>Key Characteristic</td><td>Trade-offs</td></tr><tr><td>Greedy Search</td><td>Selects the highest probability token at each step</td><td>Computationally Efficient</td><td>Risks local optima, Low diversity, Low accuracy potential</td></tr><tr><td>Beam Search</td><td>Explores k most probable sequences simultaneously</td><td>Explores multiple paths</td><td>Higher computation (depends on k), Higher quality potential</td></tr><tr><td>Random Sampling</td><td>Samples tokens from probability distribution</td><td>Promotes Diversity</td><td>Controlled by Temperature (Accuracy vs Diversity)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

efficient as it explores only a single path through the output sequence probabilities. However, it is susceptible to getting trapped in local optima, potentially missing globally optimal or higher-quality sequences later in the generation process [34].​  

Beam search extends greedy search by maintaining a set of $k$ most probable partial sequences (beams) at each step, where $k$ is the beam size [1,34]. By exploring multiple paths simultaneously, beam search has the potential to find sequences with a higher overall probability compared to greedy search, often leading to higher quality text or code [34]. The beam size parameter $( k )$ significantly impacts performance: a larger beam size increases the search space, potentially improving accuracy but also substantially increasing computational cost. Conversely, a smaller beam size is more efficient but limits the exploration depth.​  

Random sampling introduces stochasticity into the decoding process. Instead of selecting the single most probable token, tokens are sampled from the predicted probability distribution [1]. This strategy inherently promotes diversity in the generated outputs. The temperature parameter $( T )$ is commonly used with random sampling to control the level of randomness. A higher temperature ( $T > 1$ ) flattens the probability distribution, making less probable tokens more likely to be sampled, thereby increasing diversity and potentially creativity, but also raising the risk of generating incorrect or nonsensical code. A lower temperature ( $0 < T < 1$ ) sharpens the distribution, making higher probability tokens even more likely, which reduces diversity but can improve accuracy [3]. Research evaluating code generation models often assesses the performance of random sampling across different temperature settings, such as 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8, reporting metrics like pass@k to demonstrate the impact of temperature on code correctness [3].​  

The choice of decoding strategy involves navigating inherent trade-offs between code accuracy, diversity, and computational efficiency [34]. Greedy search offers the highest efficiency but may compromise accuracy and diversity. Beam search can enhance accuracy over greedy search and provide some diversity through multiple beams, but at increased computational expense proportional to the beam size. Random sampling excels at producing diverse outputs, with temperature providing fine-grained control over the diversity-accuracy balance, as evidenced by varying pass@k scores at different temperatures [3]. Researchers must select a strategy and tune its parameters based on the specific requirements of the code generation task, balancing the need for correct and diverse solutions against available computational resources.  

# 4.3 Code Representation and Refinement  

Effective code generation from natural language necessitates robust methods for both representing source code and refining the generated output to ensure correctness and quality. The initial step in processing code, similar to natural language, involves converting raw text into discrete units called tokens [28,33]. These tokens are typically words, characters, or sub-word units [28]. Tokenization standardizes input and is crucial for building a vocabulary [28,33]. Various tokenization methods exist, including space-based, rule-based, and sub-word techniques such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece [28]. Sub-word tokenization methods like BPE are particularly effective in compressing vocabulary size, which is beneficial for model efficiency and handling out-of-vocabulary words [33]. For example, CodeGeeX employs the same tokenizer as GPT2, which processes whitespaces as distinct tokens, resulting in a vocabulary size of 50,400 tokens [22]. In contrast to tokencentric approaches, some methodologies like LMQL allow users to interact with models using higher-level linguistic units such as words, sentences, or entities in prompts, leveraging built-in functions for validation based on these units [1].​  

Following tokenization, tokens or other linguistic units are converted into fixed-length vector representations known as embeddings [28,33,34]. Embeddings are fundamental for capturing the semantic and syntactic information of code elements and enabling efficient processing by machine learning models [28]. These vectors are designed such that semantically similar tokens or units are located closer to each other in the vector space [28]. Common types of embeddings include word embeddings, character embeddings, and contextual embeddings like those used in BERT [28]. The conversion from tokens to embeddings is typically performed via an embedding matrix, whose dimensions are determined by the vocabulary size and the chosen embedding dimension [33]. For instance, a vocabulary size of 32,000 with a 512-dimensional embedding would utilize a 32000x512 embedding matrix [33]. Embedding models are often trained through pre-training on large corpora (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) followed by fine-tuning on specific datasets [28].  

Beyond basic token and embedding representations, incorporating explicit syntactic and semantic information is vital for understanding code structure and meaning. Syntactic information, such as the hierarchical structure of code, can be captured by parsing the code into concrete syntax trees. Tools like Tree-sitter are utilized to obtain these trees for code files, providing a structured representation of the code's grammar [19]. Semantic information pertains to the meaning and  

relationships within the code. This can involve capturing deep semantics across different programming languages by constructing unified cross-lingual code semantic graphs [36]. Furthermore, external information embedded within the codebase, such as comments (inline, block, docstrings, TODOs, API documentation), can be leveraged to inform code generation models about the intended functionality, variable naming, algorithm selection, and overall implementation logic, effectively incorporating contextual semantic details [6].  

Ensuring the quality and correctness of generated code is paramount, necessitating methods for code correction and refinement. Standard software engineering practices offer several approaches, including static analysis, dynamic testing, and formal verification. Static analysis involves analyzing code without execution to identify potential errors or vulnerabilities. Formal verification employs mathematical methods to prove the correctness of algorithms and implementations. Dynamic testing involves executing the code with various inputs to check its behavior and correctness. Within the context of evaluating large language models for code generation, testing plays a significant role [3]. Methods have been developed to enhance the effectiveness of testing, such as employing type-aware mutation to generate new test inputs that are structurally similar yet varied from seed inputs, thereby increasing the diversity and coverage of the test suite used for evaluation [3].  

# 4.4 Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation  

Retrieval-augmented generation enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external information retrieval systems to improve the accuracy and quality of generated code [17,36]. This approach allows LLMs to leverage up-to-date or specific knowledge that may not be fully encoded in their parametric weights, addressing limitations such as hallucination or lack of context-specific awareness.  

![](images/9dbabea86b43441546d7cd12feaf7fd05cea7a3a3de942dff8aa33c745dc8bc8.jpg)  

The core idea involves retrieving relevant code snippets, documentation, or contextual information and providing this as supplementary input to the LLM during the code generation process [11]. Systems employing this paradigm, such as MLAgent, demonstrate its effectiveness in generating executable code by navigating codebases and retrieving pertinent details [11].​  

Different methodologies exist for the retrieval component. One approach focuses on utilizing immediate editor context and user activity [19]. For instance, Cody employs a two-step process involving planning and retrieval to determine the most  

relevant context for code completion [19]. Its primary retrieval mechanism examines editor state, including open tabs and recently viewed files, using a sliding window Jaccard similarity search to find relevant code snippets [19]. This method prioritizes highly localized and recent context pertinent to the developer's current task.​  

Another distinct method addresses the limitations of code generation systems restricted to single-language codebases [36]. CodeRCSG proposes constructing a multilingual codebase and creating a unified cross-lingual code semantic graph to capture deeper semantic relationships across various programming languages [36]. Unlike surface-level text matching, this method aims to leverage transferred cross-lingual programming knowledge by encoding the retrieved code semantic graph using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [36].  

The incorporation of retrieved information into the LLM's generation process varies depending on the retrieval method and the LLM architecture. In the semantic graph approach, the encoded retrieved code semantic graph is combined with the input text embeddings, allowing the code language model to effectively utilize the cross-lingual knowledge captured in the graph [36]. In systems like ML-Agent, the retrieved documentation and code snippets are directly utilized to guide the generation of executable code [11]. For context-based retrieval systems such as Cody, the retrieved code snippets and editor context serve as conditioning information provided to the LLM, enabling it to produce more accurate and contextually relevant code completions [19]. These diverse integration strategies highlight the flexibility of retrieval-augmented generation in leveraging external information, whether through explicit embedding combination, direct use as input context, or structural graph incorporation, to enhance the LLM's understanding and generation capabilities.​  

# 4.5 Modality-relative Pre-training  

Modality-relative pre-training represents a technique aimed at enhancing the performance of Natural Language to Code (NL2Code) models by strategically separating the embedding spaces used for natural language and programming language tokens [12]. This separation is motivated by the observation that tokens, even if syntactically identical, often carry vastly different semantic meanings depending on whether they appear in natural language or code [12]. For instance, a word like "while" possesses a specific, reserved meaning as a control flow structure in programming languages that is distinct from its general usage in natural language [12].  

The core concept of modality-relative pre-training is to allow the model to differentiate and represent these tokens distinctly based on their originating modality during the pre-training phase [12]. By adapting how sequence tokens are represented according to their modality, the model can better capture these discrete semantics, thereby benefiting the downstream text-to-code generation task [12]. A key potential benefit highlighted by this approach is the improved handling of programming language keywords, ensuring that the model interprets them with their precise technical meaning rather than a potentially ambiguous natural language interpretation [12]. While the technique focuses on enabling better discrimination between modal semantics for performance improvement in text-to-code generation, the provided digest does not detail specific experimental results demonstrating quantitative performance gains [12].

Evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language to code generation requires a multifaceted approach, employing both automated and human-centric methods to assess diverse aspects of code quality and correctness [7,13]. Automated metrics offer scalable and reproducible assessments, primarily focusing on functional correctness and code similarity. In contrast, human evaluation provides nuanced judgments on subjective qualities such as readability, maintainability, and overall utility in real-world scenarios [7,8].  

Automatic metrics can be broadly categorized into similarity-based and execution-based approaches. Similarity metrics compare the generated code string or its syntactic/semantic structure to a reference solution. Metrics like BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy), originally from machine translation, quantify n-gram overlap between the generated code and a reference, indicating textual similarity [26]. While simple and efficient, BLEU does not guarantee functional correctness or capture the specific semantic and syntactic structure inherent in code [8,26]. Code-specific metrics such as CodeBLEU and BluERT incorporate syntactic and semantic information to provide a more relevant measure of code resemblance [8]. These metrics help assess how closely the generated code aligns structurally with correct examples [8,13], but still do not ensure executable or functionally correct code.  

Execution-based metrics assess the functional correctness of the generated code by running it against a set of test cases. Execution accuracy measures the proportion of problems for which the generated code passes all provided tests [11,31]. A widely adopted metric for code generation is pass $@ \boldsymbol { \mathsf { k } } .$ , particularly prevalent in benchmarks like HumanEval [8,12,22,23,31]. Pass@k evaluates the probability that at least one of the top k generated code samples for a problem successfully passes all unit tests [23]. The mathematical formula for pass $@ \boldsymbol { \mathsf { k } }$ is given by:​  

$$
1 - \frac { \binom { n - c } { k } } { \binom { n } { k } }
$$  

where n is the total number of generated samples, c is the number of correct samples among n, and k is the number of samples considered [23]. This metric reflects a model's capacity to solve a problem given multiple attempts, aligning with interactive coding practices [23]. While execution-based metrics are crucial for functional correctness, their reliability is contingent on the coverage and quality of the test suites, and they do not evaluate non-functional properties. Combining functional correctness with syntactic similarity metrics can offer a more balanced assessment [13].​  

Human evaluation complements automatic metrics by providing subjective judgments on aspects like code readability, comprehensiveness, maintainability, and overall utility [7,8]. These factors are vital for the practical adoption of generated code within larger software development workflows. Research indicates that traditional functional correctness metrics alone may not fully capture the productivity gains perceived by human programmers, who might value code that reduces overall effort even if it requires minor modifications to pass all tests [13]. Subjective evaluation, while resource-intensive, captures these critical nuances [8]. Approaches leveraging LLM judges have also been explored as a means to scale humanlike evaluation [7].​  

Standardized benchmarks are essential for consistent evaluation and comparison of code generation models [7,31]. Popular benchmarks include HumanEval and MBPP (Mostly Basic Python Problems), which primarily assess functional correctness based on docstring descriptions and unit tests [23,31,37]. HumanEval consists of 164 Python problems with associated tests [23]. To support multilingual evaluation, HumanEval has been extended to HumanEval-X, featuring problems across five programming languages [8,22,31]. Other benchmarks cover diverse tasks and languages, such as CodeXGLUE and CodeFuseEval [8,31,32,35]. Specialized benchmarks like ML-Bench challenge models on machine learning tasks, requiring the use of open-source libraries and understanding of complex, context-rich code structures [11,31].​  

Despite their utility, existing benchmarks face significant limitations. A primary concern is the insufficiency of test cases in many datasets, such as the original HumanEval. This can lead to an overestimation of model performance, as models might pass the limited provided tests but fail on broader inputs or edge cases. Inaccurate problem descriptions can also contribute to misleading evaluations. Furthermore, benchmarks often have limited domain or language coverage and can be susceptible to model overfitting, where models perform exceptionally well on known benchmarks but lack generalization [8,22,23]. The simplicity of some benchmarks may not adequately reflect the complexity of real-world coding challenges that involve intricate context, dependencies, and longer code structures [11,23].​  

To address these limitations and provide a stricter assessment, advanced evaluation frameworks and enhanced benchmarks have been introduced. EvalPlus is a notable framework designed to generate more comprehensive and challenging test suites for benchmarks like HumanEval, resulting in HumanEval+. EvalPlus employs methods like LLM-based and mutation-based test generation to increase test coverage significantly, revealing subtle errors and providing a more accurate measure of robustness. Efforts within EvalPlus also include correcting errors in ground truth implementations and optimizing test suite size. The development of benchmarks like SWE-bench and DebugBench indicates a move towards evaluating models on more realistic tasks such as fixing real GitHub issues and debugging [31]. Ultimately, a comprehensive evaluation of NL2Code models necessitates the use of a diverse suite of metrics and benchmarks that encompass not only functional correctness but also code quality and performance in realistic, complex coding scenarios.​  

# 5.1 Evaluation Metrics  

Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) for code generation necessitates a combination of automated and human-centric metrics to assess both functional correctness and code quality. Automated metrics offer efficiency and reproducibility, while human evaluations provide nuanced judgments on aspects less amenable to algorithmic assessment.  

Automatic metrics typically quantify code similarity or functional correctness. Similarity-based metrics compare the generated code string or its representation to a reference [26]. For instance, BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy), originally developed for machine translation, calculates n-gram overlap between the generated code and a reference [26]. While simple, BLEU's limitation lies in its inability to capture semantic or syntactic correctness inherent in code [8,26]. To address this, metrics specifically designed for code, such as CodeBLEU and BluERT, incorporate syntactic structure and semantic meaning [8]. These metrics offer an indication of how closely the generated code resembles known correct examples syntactically and structurally, complementing plain text similarity [8,13]. However, these similarity metrics do not guarantee that the generated code is functionally correct or executable.​  

Functional correctness is predominantly evaluated using execution-based metrics. The most common approach involves assessing whether the generated code passes a set of predefined test cases [11,31]. A fundamental metric is execution accuracy, which measures the proportion of problems for which the generated code produces the correct output on provided tests [11,31]. A widely adopted metric in code generation benchmarks like HumanEval is pass $@ \boldsymbol { \mathsf { k } }$ [3,8,12,22,23,31]. Pass@k evaluates the probability that at least one of the top $k$ generated code samples for a given problem passes all the provided unit tests [3,23]. This metric is considered more meaningful than strict accuracy (equivalent to pass $@ 1$ ) for assessing a model's capability to solve a programming challenge, as it accounts for the common practice of generating multiple code suggestions [23]. It measures the model's ability to produce anyworking solution within a limited number of attempts, reflecting its potential problem-solving capacity rather than the reliability of a single generation [23]. While robust for functional correctness, execution-based metrics rely heavily on the quality and coverage of the test cases and do not assess aspects like code style, efficiency, or maintainability.​  

Complementary to automatic methods, human evaluation provides a comprehensive assessment [8]. Human evaluators can judge aspects such as code correctness, readability, comprehensiveness, and maintainability [7]. Readability pertains to how easy the code is for humans to understand, while maintainability relates to the ease with which it can be modified or extended. These factors are crucial for integrating generated code into larger software projects but are challenging to measure automatically. Empirical evidence suggests that functional correctness alone does not fully capture the potential productivity gains offered by code generation models, highlighting the importance of these human-centric qualities [13]. Subjective evaluation methods, though resource-intensive and potentially prone to variability, capture these nuanced aspects [8]. Some approaches utilize LLM judges as a proxy for human evaluation to streamline this process [7].  

The trade-offs between different correctness metrics like pass $@ \boldsymbol { \mathsf { k } }$ and strict accuracy are significant [23]. Strict accuracy $( \mathsf { p a s s } @ 1 )$ provides a stringent measure of the model's ability to generate a correct solution on the first attempt, reflecting its reliability for single-suggestion scenarios. In contrast, pass $@ \boldsymbol { \mathsf { k } }$ with $k > 1$ offers a more forgiving evaluation that assesses the model's underlying capability to solve the problem given multiple chances, which aligns with interactive coding scenarios where users might explore several suggestions [23]. While pass $@ \boldsymbol { \mathsf { k } }$ provides a higher score and might better indicate a model's potential, strict accuracy is a better indicator of its performance in contexts requiring high reliability on the initial output. Combining functional correctness (measured by pass $@ \boldsymbol { \mathsf { k } }$ or execution accuracy) with other metrics like syntactic similarity can offer a more balanced view [13]. Ultimately, a thorough evaluation requires employing a suite of metrics, encompassing both automated checks for functional correctness and similarity, and human assessment for code quality and usability.​

Evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) for natural language to code generation relies heavily on standardized benchmarks [7,31]. Several prominent datasets have emerged for this purpose, each with distinct characteristics and objectives [31].  

HumanEval is a widely adopted benchmark consisting of 164 Python programming problems, each accompanied by a docstring describing the task and a set of unit tests for functional verification [23]. It is commonly used alongside other benchmarks like MBPP (Mostly Basic Python Problems) for assessing LLMs' code generation capabilities [8,37]. Recognizing the need for multilingual evaluation, HumanEval has been extended to HumanEval-X, which comprises 820 problems covering Python, $\mathsf { C } { + } { + }$ , Java, JavaScript, and Go, with each sample including a declaration, docstring, and solution [8,22]. Other benchmarks frequently referenced include DS1000 and CodeXGLUE, further expanding the scope and diversity of evaluation tasks [8,35]. CodeFuseEval is another benchmark designed to include multiple tasks and support several languages such as Java, $\mathsf { C } { + } { + }$ , JavaScript, and Python [8].  

Beyond standard function-level generation, benchmarks like ML-Bench specifically challenge LLMs on machine learning tasks, requiring a deeper understanding of complex code structures and library usage [11]. ML-Bench features 10044 samples and 130 tasks sourced from 14 notable machine learning GitHub repositories [11]. The problems in ML-Bench necessitate understanding long, interleaved language-code documents and intricate cross-file code structures, pushing the boundaries of LLM comprehension beyond isolated function generation [11]. These tasks implicitly test the model's ability to handle dependencies and context related to specific libraries and larger codebases, aspects crucial for real-world software development.​  

Despite their utility, existing benchmarks possess limitations that can affect the comprehensive evaluation of LLMs. A significant concern is the limited size of the test suites in many datasets. For instance, the original HumanEval, while popular, is relatively small. To address this, HumanEval+ was introduced, featuring a significantly expanded test suite with 80 times more unique test cases and corrected ground truth implementations compared to the original, thus providing a more rigorous assessment of correctness [3]. Furthermore, benchmarks often suffer from limitations in domain coverage, focusing on specific types of problems or languages, which may not reflect the full spectrum of programming tasks encountered in practice [8]. Potential biases within the datasets, stemming from their creation process or the limited scope of problems, can also influence evaluation outcomes [8]. These limitations highlight the ongoing need for the development of more diverse, comprehensive, and challenging benchmarks that better reflect the complexity and variety of real-world coding scenarios.  

# 5.3 Advanced Evaluation Frameworks and Limitations  

Existing benchmarks for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation often exhibit significant limitations that hinder their ability to accurately reflect real-world programming scenarios and can lead to an overestimation of LLM capabilities [3,23]. Benchmarks such as HumanEval are noted for their relative simplicity, potentially failing to represent the complexity and nuance of practical coding challenges [23]. This gap is further highlighted by studies focusing on real-world tasks that require LLMs to interact with existing open-source libraries, demonstrating a disparity between performance on simplified benchmarks and applicability in complex environments [11]. Furthermore, many benchmarks primarily emphasize functional correctness based on a limited set of unit tests [3,13], potentially underestimating the value of code that, while not perfectly passing all tests, significantly reduces developer effort [13]. Concerns also exist regarding the limited scope of some benchmarks, often focusing solely on languages like Python and relying on metrics that may not fully capture performance across diverse programming paradigms or languages [22]. The potential for models to overfit on publicly available benchmark datasets poses another challenge, potentially leading to inflated performance metrics specific to those datasets rather than generalized capability [23]. The need for more comprehensive and realistic evaluation scenarios that account for variations in prompts, model parameters, and tokenization strategies is evident [8].  

These limitations, particularly the reliance on insufficient test suites, can lead to an overestimation of the true functional correctness and overall capabilities of LLMs in practical settings [3]. A model might appear highly proficient on a benchmark by passing all provided tests, yet fail when confronted with more diverse or challenging inputs encountered in real applications. The limited scope and simplicity of existing tests mean that many potential edge cases, off-nominal inputs, or complex interactions might not be covered, resulting in a misleadingly high reported success rate [3].  

To address these shortcomings, advanced evaluation frameworks have been developed to provide a more accurate and rigorous assessment of code generation models. EvalPlus is a notable example, designed to mitigate the limitations of benchmarks like HumanEval by generating more comprehensive and challenging test suites [3]. EvalPlus employs both LLMbased and mutation-based techniques to systematically generate additional test inputs beyond the original benchmark tests, thereby providing a deeper evaluation of functional correctness across a wider range of scenarios [3]. This methodology significantly increases the test coverage and helps reveal subtle errors or limitations that simpler test suites might miss, leading to a more precise assessment of a model's robustness and correctness. EvalPlus also incorporates test suite reduction techniques, such as in HumanEval+-Mini, to maintain evaluation efficiency while retaining testing efficacy, and includes efforts to identify and correct errors in the ground truth implementations of original benchmarks [3]. The development of benchmarks like HumanEval-X for multilingual evaluation [22], SWE-bench and DebugBench for real-world scenarios and debugging [31], and ML-Bench for tasks leveraging open-source libraries [11] further underscores the field's movement towards more representative and comprehensive evaluation paradigms that better reflect the demands of realworld software development. Efforts are also underway to explore broader evaluation metrics beyond simple functional correctness, considering factors like the value contributed even by imperfect code [13].​  

# 6. Applications and Impact on Software Development  

The advent of large language models (LLMs) has profoundly impacted software development, giving rise to various Natural Language to Code (NL2Code) applications and tools that enhance productivity, streamline processes, and enable new paradigms [15,37]. AI programming tools can be broadly categorized into two main approaches: AI-assisted programming and AI-independent programming [4,9]. AI-assisted programming involves AI acting as a collaborator or assistant to human developers, augmenting their capabilities, whereas AI-independent programming envisions AI autonomously handling significant portions or even the entirety of the development process from high-level specifications [9].  

AI-assisted coding tools represent a relatively mature category, leveraging LLMs to provide intelligent support throughout the coding process [8,9]. These tools exhibit diverse functionalities, including code completion, code generation, code explanation, debugging assistance, and automated code reviews [2,9,39]. Integration approaches vary, with many tools functioning as plugins within established Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), such as GitHub Copilot and  

CodeGPT [9]. Other tools, like Cursor, aim for deeper integration within the IDE itself to provide a more seamless user experience [9]. Prominent examples include GitHub Copilot, which is widely recognized for its intelligent code completion and generation capabilities, supporting numerous languages and integrating with popular editors [6,21,39]. It assists developers by suggesting code snippets, reducing the need to search for syntax or common patterns, and offering multiple suggestion options [6]. Tabnine utilizes deep learning for context-aware suggestions, excelling in speed and cross-editor compatibility, and offers the unique ability to train on private codebases [21]. Codeium is noted for its focus on privacy and open-source nature, suitable for exploring APIs [21]. CodeGeeX supports extensive languages and includes translation features [21,22]. Other tools like Visual Studio IntelliCode, Sourcery (Python/JavaScript specific), and Amazon CodeWhisperer offer specialized assistance, including refactoring, performance optimization, automated code reviews, and debugging suggestions [4,21,39]. While general-purpose models like ChatGPT can also generate code, specialized tools like Copilot are often preferred by experienced engineers for specific coding tasks, though ChatGPT can be effective for generating larger code blocks [4,25]. Despite their significant utility in accelerating coding and improving quality, AI coding assistants are considered "helpful but still maturing," indicating ongoing development is necessary to address limitations in suggestion quality and reliability in complex scenarios [25,29]. The need for robust AI validation frameworks is highlighted to ensure the dependable performance of these tools [7].​  

In contrast, AI-independent programming, or the "idea to code" paradigm, seeks to automate the creation of entire project structures from high-level user inputs like text-based requirements or visual designs [9]. Platforms in this category, such as Bolt.new, Lovable, Replit Agent, and Vercel's v0, aim to translate abstract concepts directly into functional code and application architecture [9]. However, current evaluations indicate that these platforms face significant limitations, typically achieving only approximately $3 0 \%$ of the functionality required for a complete application and primarily building basic prototype frameworks [9]. Generating complex user interactions, sophisticated application logic, and robust backend systems still requires substantial intervention and refinement by professional software engineers [9]. While these tools represent an ambitious shift towards greater automation, the complete automation of complex software development from conception remains a challenge. AI programming tools can be viewed on a spectrum from L1 (intelligent code completion) to L5 (collaborative AI development teams), illustrating the gradual increase in automation levels [10].  

![](images/500a5c11097c16ed6103cb8c9ceeebc34f685014c22a4c8cdbb9c5faaf33509f.jpg)  

The integration of AI is fundamentally transforming the software development lifecycle (SDLC), impacting every phase from requirements analysis to maintenance [4,10]. AI tools enhance efficiency, accelerate development, and improve code quality by automating routine tasks and assisting with complex ones [4,15,21,29]. Quantifiable benefits have been observed across the SDLC: requirements analysis can see document production accelerated by approximately $6 0 \%$ through user story derivation; code implementation benefits from up to an $8 0 \%$ reduction in initialization time via intelligent scaffolding; automated unit test generation can improve code coverage by up to $4 5 \%$ ; and operational tasks like grayscale publishing strategy selection and intelligent alarm attribution analysis from logs also see efficiency gains [4]. While these benefits are substantial, integrating AI introduces challenges related to code controllability, security boundaries, and ensuring the reliability of generated outputs [4,7].​  

NL2Code applications extend to specific domains and use cases. In finance, models like BloombergGPT can generate domain-specific languages such as Bloomberg Query Language (BQL) for data access and analysis, and assist with tasks like sentiment analysis and financial question answering [5,15,17]. Data science can benefit from tasks like text-to-SQL generation and automated machine learning assistance [32]. Furthermore, NL2Code serves as a valuable educational tool, assisting students in learning programming languages by automatically generating or completing code snippets [2]. Broader industry applications encompass automated software development, code search, program repair, automated testing (including black-box testing for mobile apps), vulnerability detection, particularly in complex domains like smart contracts [32,42,43], code refactoring/migration, code commenting/summarization, and type prediction [32]. These applications collectively demonstrate the transformative potential of NL2Code and LLMs across various facets of the software development landscape.  

# 6.1 AI-Assisted Coding Tools  

AI-assisted programming tools are increasingly integral to the software development lifecycle, significantly impacting tasks such as code completion, generation, explanation, and debugging [8,9]. These tools leverage large language models (LLMs) to offer developers intelligent assistance, aiming to enhance productivity and code quality [15,21].​  

Current AI coding assistants exhibit diverse functionalities and integration approaches. A common method involves integration into integrated development environments (IDEs) as plugins, exemplified by tools like GitHub Copilot and CodeGPT [9]. Alternatively, some tools pursue deeper integration within the IDE itself to provide a more seamless and natural user experience, as seen with Cursor [9].​  

A range of prominent tools has emerged, each with specific capabilities. GitHub Copilot, a representative L1 tool for intelligent code completion [10], is widely recognized for generating auto-suggested code, preventing errors, and supporting numerous programming languages [21,39]. It integrates smoothly with popular editors such as Visual Studio Code and JetBrains IDEs, offering features like autosuggestions and multiple suggestion options, with strong proficiency noted in languages including Python, JavaScript, Java, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C, and $\mathsf { C } { + } { + }$ [6]. Copilot is considered particularly helpful for debugging, prototyping, and learning new technologies [21]. Its ability to accurately recognize developer patterns is a key strength observed in practice [29]. While general-purpose models like ChatGPT can also generate code, providing efficient and readable outputs by analyzing patterns [15], Copilot is often recommended for experienced engineers due to its perceived higher quality of code suggestions compared to ChatGPT for certain tasks [25]. However, ChatGPT has shown utility for generating larger code blocks, such as function-level implementations, demonstrating a $4 0 \%$ reduction in Spring Boot interface development time in one case [4].  

Other tools offer distinct specializations. Tabnine provides intelligent, context-aware suggestions powered by deep learning, known for its speed and compatibility across various editors and languages [21]. It is particularly useful for handling complex logic or repetitive code patterns and uniquely allows training the AI model on private codebases [21]. Codeium focuses on improving productivity by automating generation and offering intelligent completions, suitable for exploring APIs and libraries, and stands out for its open-source nature and emphasis on privacy [21]. CodeGeeX supports over 30 languages and includes a translation mode, excelling in accurate and context-aware completions, especially valuable when starting new projects [21]. Its VS Code extension offers completion, explanation, and summarization [22]. Visual Studio IntelliCode integrates with Visual Studio, offering customization and context-aware suggestions, assisting with code refactoring and ensuring adherence to best practices [21]. Sourcery, a Python and JavaScript specific tool, automates repetitive tasks, improves quality, assists with performance optimization, and aids in legacy code refactoring [21]. Amazon CodeWhisperer is highlighted for automating code reviews, recommending fixes [39], and performing autonomous debugging, such as identifying and correcting Java null pointer exceptions [4]. Duet AI understands context and provides real-time assistance, aiming to boost productivity and creativity [15]. Cody, another code AI assistant utilizing LLMs for completion, emphasizes its capability to understand the entirecodebase for generating relevant suggestions and highlights the underlying AI engineering system, including pre- and post-processing steps, critical for effective LLM use [19]. Tencent Cloud's CODING platform integrates AI code self-checking features [4]. Beyond code generation, deep learning models are also applied in areas like API recommendation systems for Android programming and automated black-box Android app testing [43].​  

These tools collectively enhance developer productivity by accelerating coding speed through suggestions and automation, reducing time spent on repetitive tasks, and aiding in understanding code [15,21,29]. They contribute to improved code quality by suggesting code based on best practices, helping prevent errors, assisting with refactoring, and providing automated checks [4,15,21,39]. However, despite their significant utility, AI coding assistants are noted as being "helpful but still maturing" [29], suggesting ongoing development is required to fully realize their potential and address limitations in the quality or reliability of suggestions in complex or novel scenarios [25]. The increasing focus on robust AI validation  

frameworks, such as support for features like code suggestions and AI chat functionalities, underscores the importance of ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of these tools [7].  

# 6.2 AI-Independent Code Generation Platforms  

AI-independent programming, often referred to as "idea to code," represents an ambitious paradigm shift aiming to automate the entire software development process based solely on high-level user inputs [9]. This approach envisions a scenario where users, potentially without extensive programming expertise, can generate complete project structures by articulating their requirements through various modalities such as text-based Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) or visual inputs like images [9]. The core objective is to translate a conceptual idea directly into functional code and application architecture.​  

Despite the transformative potential, achieving a truly AI-independent, end-to-end code generation process remains a significant challenge [9]. Current platforms operating in this domain exhibit notable limitations. According to analysis, most contemporary products can typically realize only approximately $3 0 \%$ of the required functionality for a complete application, primarily focusing on the construction of basic prototype frameworks [9]. Generating complex user interactions, sophisticated application logic, and robust backend systems still necessitates substantial refinement and intervention from professional software engineers [9].​  

Several platforms are emerging that attempt to navigate this "idea to code" landscape. Examples of typical products cited in this category include Bolt.new, Lovable, Replit Agent, and Vercel's v0 [9]. Some of these tools, like v0 and Tempo Labs' Tempo, are specifically noted for assisting users in creating websites, often concentrating on particular layers of the software stack, such as front-end development [9,10]. While the available information provides a list of these platforms and their overarching goal, detailed comparative analysis concerning their unique technical capabilities, the specific types of applications they target beyond general websites, or their primary user demographics (beyond the broad category of users without programming knowledge) is limited in the current scope. Nevertheless, the shared characteristic among these platforms appears to be the pursuit of generating initial codebases or frameworks from abstract ideas, albeit with varying degrees of focus (e.g., front-end specific) and a universal challenge in fully automating the creation of complex, productionready applications [9,10]. The current state suggests that while AI can initiate the coding process from conceptual input, human expertise remains indispensable for realizing the full spectrum of application functionality.​  

# 6.3 Impact on Software Development Lifecycle  

Artificial intelligence is fundamentally transforming the software development lifecycle (SDLC), impacting every phase from initial requirements analysis through implementation, testing, and operations [10]. This integration offers significant benefits, primarily centered on improving efficiency, accelerating development, and enhancing code quality [4,15,21,29].  

AI tools demonstrate the potential to save developers considerable time and minimize errors [15], leading to a faster development pace, especially when users are adept at leveraging these tools [29]. They achieve this by providing real-time assistance, including suggesting code snippets, detecting errors, and offering solutions [21]. Furthermore, AI aids in maintaining coding standards and best practices across development teams, contributing to more efficient and higherquality code [21]. Beyond core coding, AI streamlines related tasks such as financial data querying and content creation, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency in domains like generating newsletter headlines [5]. The overarching vision is for AI to automate routine tasks, thereby enabling developers to dedicate more focus to higher-level, complex activities [10].​  

The impact of AI is quantifiable across specific SDLC stages [4]. In the requirements analysis phase, AI can accelerate document production by approximately $6 0 \%$ through the automatic derivation of user stories [4]. During the code implementation phase, intelligent scaffolding provided by AI can reduce initialization time by a substantial $8 0 \%$ [4]. Practical examples illustrate this efficiency gain, such as Tencent Cloud's reported $6 0 \%$ reduction in serverless application deployment time [4]. In the testing phase, AI-driven unit test generation can improve code coverage by up to $45 \%$ [4]. AI also extends its utility into operations, facilitating tasks like automatic selection of grayscale publishing strategies based on system load [4]. For instance, an e-commerce platform achieved a $3 5 \%$ reduction in resource waste by using AI to dynamically adjust Kubernetes cluster scaling during promotional periods [4]. Additionally, AI assists in troubleshooting by supporting intelligent alarm attribution analysis through the automatic extraction of core exception patterns from logs [4].  

Despite the significant benefits, integrating AI into the software development workflow introduces challenges and risks. Key concerns include code controllability and the establishment of clear security boundaries [4]. Ensuring the reliability and quality of AI-generated outputs remains crucial, necessitating validation frameworks to mitigate risks associated with generative AI [7]. Efforts are underway to develop centralized evaluation frameworks aimed at supporting future AI-powered features, further enhancing developer productivity, and building confidence in the reliability and value of AI processes across the SDLC [7].​

Achieving accurate and reliable code generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a series of significant technical challenges. These difficulties span the spectrum from understanding complex natural language requirements and intricate code structures to ensuring the correctness, reliability, and broad generalization capabilities of the generated code. Addressing these challenges is paramount for bridging the gap between benchmark performance and practical applicability, ultimately enabling LLMs to transition from coding assistants to more autonomous tools [9,11,37].  

A primary hurdle lies in ensuring the correctness and reliability of the code produced by LLMs. While these models can generate syntactically valid code, they are prone to introducing functional errors, logical inconsistencies, and even security vulnerabilities, a phenomenon often linked to "hallucinations" [16,40]. The models may struggle particularly with complex business logic [4] or nuanced problem domains, leading to unreliable outputs [39]. Furthermore, generated code might contain suboptimal patterns, introduce technical debt, or rely on outdated practices [39]. Evaluating the true correctness of LLM-generated code is also challenging, as standard benchmarks may not be sufficiently rigorous to uncover subtle errors [3]. More stringent evaluation frameworks reveal a notable performance drop compared to standard metrics, highlighting limitations in capturing true functional correctness [3,8]. Consequently, effective verification, rigorous testing, and debugging methods specifically designed for LLM-generated code are critically needed [3]. This also necessitates acknowledging the current need for human oversight and refinement of AI-generated suggestions [2,10,39].  

Another significant challenge is the difficulty in handling the inherent complexity and ambiguity involved in the code generation process. Translating complex natural language requirements and business logic into precise, executable code is non-trivial [9]. LLMs often face difficulties in comprehending intricate code structures, navigating large codebases, understanding detailed library documentation, and managing dependencies and versioning [11,29]. Simultaneously, natural language descriptions are frequently underspecified or ambiguous, leading to multiple possible interpretations of the desired functionality [3]. This ambiguity makes it difficult for LLMs to consistently produce correct outputs. Approaches like incorporating formal specifications, such as program contracts, are being explored to provide clearer guidance and mitigate the challenges posed by ambiguous inputs [3].​  

Ensuring the generalization ability of LLMs across different programming languages, coding styles, and application domains represents a further technical hurdle [37]. While some advanced models show capability across numerous languages [40], performance can vary significantly, suggesting difficulties in consistently generalizing reasoning abilities and handling the unique linguistic nuances of diverse programming paradigms [2,22]. Challenges persist particularly with low-resource languages or those with significant semantic and syntactic differences from common languages [26]. Research into techniques like cross-lingual semantic graphs aims to improve knowledge transfer and adaptability across languages [36]. Despite some capacity for general task generalization [17], achieving robust and consistent performance across the wide variety of programming contexts remains an active area of development.​  

Beyond these core issues, several other technical challenges impact the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation. These include the substantial computational resources required for training and deployment [1,18,26,27,28], potential biases present in training data that can be reflected in generated code [2,28,34], the "black box" nature of LLMs which limits interpretability and understanding of their decision-making processes [2,28,34], latency issues in generating code, especially for real-time applications like code completion [19,40], difficulties in updating model knowledge and preventing knowledge drift [18,36,40], and security vulnerabilities such as prompt injection attacks or sensitive data disclosure [40]. The cumulative effect of these technical challenges contributes to the "considerable divide" observed between performance on simplified benchmarks and the demands of real-world software development [11,37].  

# 7.1 Code Correctness and Reliability  

A significant challenge in the adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation lies in ensuring the correctness and reliability of the generated code [4,29]. While these tools offer substantial productivity gains, they are not infallible and can introduce errors ranging from functional bugs to security vulnerabilities [21].  

LLMs can generate incorrect or insecure code for several reasons. A primary factor is the models' inherent tendency to produce misleading or inaccurate information, often referred to as "hallucinations," which can translate directly into syntactically correct but functionally wrong code [40]. While newer models show reductions in hallucination rates [40], the potential for generating incorrect logic remains. Furthermore, LLMs may struggle particularly with complex business logic or intricate problem domains, leading to unreliable outputs when faced with such challenges [4,39]. They can also produce suboptimal code, such as duplicate code segments or suggestions relying on outdated libraries, which can introduce technical debt or compatibility issues [39].​  

The types of errors introduced by LLMs are diverse. Beyond simple functional errors, observed instances include failures on specific computational problems, such as those encountered by GitHub Copilot on mathematical tasks [29]. More critically, LLM-generated code may contain potential security threats, including vulnerabilities like SQL injections, which are particularly concerning when applied to sensitive areas such as smart contracts [25,42].​  

Evaluating the correctness of LLM-generated code also presents challenges. Existing benchmarks may not be sufficiently rigorous to expose subtle errors [3]. A more rigorous evaluation framework, like EvalPlus, has demonstrated that models show a significant performance drop ( $1 9 . 3 \substack { - 2 8 . 9 \% }$ decrease in pass $@ \boldsymbol { \mathsf { k } }$ ) when evaluated with more robust test cases, highlighting the limitations of standard metrics in capturing true functional correctness [3]. However, it is also important to acknowledge that focusing solely on strict functional correctness might sometimes underestimate the value of models that produce code requiring minor edits but significantly reduce overall development effort [13].​  

Given these limitations, there is a critical need for more effective methods for code verification, testing, and debugging specifically tailored for LLM-generated code. Developers must actively review and use their judgment regarding AI-provided suggestions, as these tools should be viewed as assistants rather than autonomous agents [21]. This necessitates the development of robust testing frameworks, static analysis tools, and debugging methodologies that can efficiently identify and help rectify the unique types of errors introduced by LLMs, thereby enhancing the overall reliability and security of software development workflows.​  

# 7.2 Handling Complexity and Ambiguity  

Translating complex natural language requirements into precise and executable code presents a significant challenge in the field of natural language to code generation with large language models (LLMs). This difficulty stems from two primary sources: the inherent complexity of code structures themselves and the ambiguity often present in natural language inputs.  

Handling complex code structures is a notable hurdle. LLMs face difficulties in understanding intricate codebases, especially when dealing with the detailed structures and extensive documentation found within large open-source libraries [11]. While AI coding tools demonstrate proficiency in generating boilerplate code and code exhibiting repeating, well-understood patterns, their performance declines when required to interact consistently with specific libraries and manage different library versions [29]. This indicates a gap in their ability to grasp the nuances of specific library APIs and maintain coherence across complex dependencies.​  

Furthermore, ambiguity in natural language descriptions significantly complicates the code generation process. Natural language is often underspecified, leaving room for multiple interpretations of the desired functionality, input formats, or edge cases. This lack of precision makes it difficult for LLMs to deterministically produce correct code. To mitigate this, research explores methods to provide clearer specifications. For instance, employing program contracts, which formally define the expected behavior and input/output formats of code components, has been shown to help clarify ambiguous natural language descriptions [3]. By offering more structured and explicit guidance, program contracts can direct LLMs towards generating more accurate and reliable code [3]. Addressing both the complexity of target code structures and the ambiguity of source natural language is crucial for improving the robustness and accuracy of NL2Code systems.  

# 7.3 Generalization and Adaptability  

A critical aspect of large language models (LLMs) for code generation is their ability to generalize across diverse tasks and adapt to varied contexts [17]. This generalization capability is particularly pertinent in the domain of programming, where models are expected to handle different programming languages, coding styles, and application domains beyond their specific training data.  

Generalization across programming languages presents a significant challenge and area of research. While some advanced models, such as GPT 4.5, have demonstrated exceptional performance across a considerable number of languages, reportedly covering 14 languages effectively [40], other models exhibit varying degrees of success. For instance, CodeGeeX, a multilingual code generation model, has shown that its ability to solve problems can vary significantly across different languages. This inconsistency indicates underlying challenges in generalizing reasoning abilities and linguistic nuances inherent to diverse programming paradigms [22].​  

Addressing this challenge, research explores methods to improve cross-lingual generalization. One approach involves leveraging cross-lingual semantic graphs to enable models to transfer knowledge effectively between different programming languages. This method aims to capture language-agnostic semantic structures, thereby enhancing the model's ability to generalize code generation capabilities to less-represented or entirely new languages [36]. Such techniques are crucial for developing models that are versatile tools for a global user base [40] and can mitigate the performance disparities observed across languages [22].  

In summary, while LLMs demonstrate a general capacity for task generalization [17], their adaptability in the specific context of code generation, particularly across diverse programming languages, is an ongoing area of development. Models show varying performance, with some achieving broad multilingual capabilities while others struggle with consistent generalization. Research into methods like cross-lingual semantic graphs aims to bridge these gaps and improve the models' capacity to transfer knowledge and adapt to the multilingual nature of programming [36].  

# 8. Ethical and Social Considerations  

![](images/a92d6a02898a36101af57460ae636fa11b282d853baf526e2822c1222026d0f0.jpg)  

The increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the software development workflow necessitates a thorough examination of the associated ethical and social considerations [21]. These concerns span several critical areas, including the transformation of traditional roles and skills, issues surrounding intellectual property and code ownership, the potential for generating biased or insecure code, and the need for model interpretability and responsible development guidelines [4,17,32,40,42].​  

A significant area of impact is the potential for job displacement and the fundamental transformation of engineering roles [4,16,39]. While AI coding assistants enhance productivity, they exert pressure on developers, particularly those focused on basic coding tasks, to adapt to new paradigms involving collaboration with and training of AI systems [4,21]. This shift requires deeper skills in areas like debugging, architectural design, and understanding complex system interactions [4]. A related concern is the potential erosion of traditional debugging skills and the risk of over-reliance on AI, which might impede foundational learning processes for new developers and mask underlying problems [4,21]. Concurrently, the rise of AI-generated code introduces complex legal and ethical questions regarding code ownership, intellectual property rights, and fair use, as the traditional concept of authorship is challenged when machines contribute significantly to or autonomously produce code [4,32,39].​  

Beyond role transformation and ownership, significant security and bias considerations arise from AI code generation [21,32]. AI-generated code may inherently contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited, posing security risks [21,32,42]. Furthermore, the tools could be misused to generate malicious software or scripts [21,28]. Specific risks to the models themselves, such as prompt injection attacks and accidental data leaks, also pose threats that can affect the security of the generated code [40]. Addressing these necessitates robust security analysis, continuous monitoring, and establishing clear security boundaries for AI-assisted development [4,21,32,40].  

The issue of bias is also critical, as LLMs trained on vast datasets may reflect and perpetuate existing biases found online or in code repositories [21,32]. This can lead to the generation of biased or harmful code that is unfair or inappropriate for certain contexts or user groups [32,40]. Mitigating bias involves curating diverse training data and employing advanced alignment techniques to reduce the generation of harmful content [21,40].  

Ensuring interpretability and explainability in NL2Code models is paramount for building trust and fostering effective human-AI collaboration [32,40]. The inherent "black-box" nature of many advanced LLMs makes it challenging to understand or trace the process by which code is generated, creating a cognitive gap between the AI's output and the developer's understanding [32]. This opacity hinders debugging and verification, limiting the adoption of these tools in critical or regulated domains where reliability and accountability are essential [32].​  

Collectively, these challenges highlight the necessity of developing responsible and ethical guidelines for the development, deployment, and usage of NL2Code systems [17]. Adherence to principles ensuring code is honest, harmless, and helpful is crucial for building reliable and trustworthy AI coding assistants [7]. Future work must focus on addressing these multifaceted ethical and social implications to ensure the beneficial and equitable integration of AI into the software development landscape.  

# 8.1 Code Ownership and Job Transformation  

The increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the software development lifecycle introduces complex challenges regarding code ownership and intellectual property rights [4]. A primary concern lies in establishing a clear definition of copyright for code generated by AI systems, as the traditional framework of authorship is complicated when a machine contributes significantly to or autonomously produces code [4]. This ambiguity extends to fair use considerations, which are a source of concern among developers utilizing AI assistants [39]. Determining the legal standing and rights associated with AI-generated code is crucial for future regulatory frameworks and industry practices.​  

Beyond legal and ethical considerations, the advent of AI in coding is fundamentally transforming engineering roles. There is notable pressure on engineers, particularly those primarily engaged in basic coding tasks, to adapt to this evolving landscape [4]. While AI tools can enhance productivity, they also raise concerns about potential job displacement for roles centered around repetitive or straightforward coding functions. Furthermore, reliance on AI-generated code introduces risks, such as developers potentially developing an over-reliance that diminishes their understanding of underlying principles [4]. An illustrative example involved an AI masking a Spring Bean circular dependency issue, subsequently doubling online troubleshooting time, highlighting the potential for AI to obscure fundamental problems rather than always solving them transparently [4]. This suggests a shift in the developer's role from primary code generators to collaborators with and trainers of AI systems, necessitating deeper skills in debugging, architectural design, and understanding complex system interactions that AI tools may not fully comprehend or generate correctly.​  

# 8.2 Security and Bias  

The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into code generation processes introduces significant considerations regarding security and potential biases in the generated output. A primary concern is the inherent security risks associated with AI-generated code. This includes the generation of code containing vulnerabilities that could be exploited, as well as the potential for misuse, where the tools are employed to create malicious software or scripts [21,42]. Specific security risks identified in the context of LLMs themselves, which can translate to code generation contexts, include prompt injection attacks designed to manipulate the model's output and data leaks that could expose sensitive information used during the generation process [40].​  

Beyond security, the issue of bias stemming from the training data is critical. LLMs are trained on vast datasets, which may reflect existing biases present in the internet and code repositories. These biases can manifest in the generated code, affecting its fairness, reliability, and appropriateness for different contexts or user groups [21,34]. Biased models may, for instance, generate code snippets that perpetuate stereotypes or are less robust for certain tasks or environments. The generation of harmful or biased content is a recognized challenge [40].​  

Mitigating these risks necessitates a multi-faceted approach. To address security vulnerabilities and misuse, incorporating robust security analysis techniques into the development and deployment pipeline of AI coding assistants is essential [21]. Furthermore, continuous monitoring is crucial for detecting unusual generation behavior or tracking the emergence of vulnerabilities in generated code [40]. Regarding bias, strategies include curating more diverse and representative training datasets to reduce the propagation of harmful patterns [21]. Advanced alignment techniques are also being developed and implemented in models to actively reduce the generation of harmful or biased content, demonstrating improved performance against adversarial attempts to elicit such outputs [40].  

# 8.3 Interpretability and Transparency  

Interpretability and explainability are crucial considerations in the development and deployment of natural language to code generation systems based on large language models (LLMs). Establishing trust in these automated systems and enabling effective human-AI collaboration necessitates a clear understanding of how the generated code is derived [40]. Without such transparency, developers and users may hesitate to rely on AI-generated code, particularly in sensitive or critical applications.  

A significant challenge in this domain stems from the inherently opaque nature of many advanced machine learning and text generation models. This "black-box" characteristic makes it difficult to trace or interpret the internal decision-making processes that lead to the generation of specific code outputs [34]. Consequently, understanding why a model produces a particular piece of code, or troubleshooting errors and unexpected behaviors, becomes a complex task.​  

This lack of interpretability limits the widespread adoption of LLM-based code generation tools in fields where reliability, verification, and accountability are paramount, such as the development of safety-critical systems or applications in regulated industries, mirroring challenges observed in other sensitive domains like law and medicine where model opacity hinders deployment [34].​  

# 9. Future Trends and Opportunities  

![](images/0ab0dec156126c9ddbe5b2a8619d57de4a68dbd0525fbbe66854026edcd92600.jpg)  

The field of Natural Language to Code generation (NL2Code) continues to evolve rapidly, presenting numerous promising future research directions and opportunities. A critical area for advancement lies in developing more robust and comprehensive evaluation metrics and techniques [3,8,13]. Current benchmarks often primarily focus on functional correctness, but future evaluations need to encompass a broader spectrum of technical capabilities and service performance, including skill, efficiency, robustness, and stability [8]. There is a recognized need to address the limitations of existing benchmarks by developing metrics that can accurately assess code quality, handle complex logic, edge cases, and ambiguous instructions, thereby enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of generated code [3]. Future metrics should consider factors beyond simple correctness, such as the effort required to integrate generated code into larger projects, and explore hybrid approaches combining automated assessments with human feedback to better align with real-world developer value judgments and gains [13]. Evaluating models based on quality, cost, and latency will also become increasingly important [7]. Innovation in evaluation techniques is anticipated to ensure reliability and repeatability of results [8].​  

Future research will also focus on developing more robust and reliable code generation models capable of handling increasingly complex natural language input [3,34]. Improving model accuracy and robustness is a continuous opportunity [1]. This includes enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand complex logic, edge cases, and ambiguous instructions [3]. Advancements are needed in helping models extract essential and common programming knowledge, enhancing reasoning ability across different languages, and exploring techniques like few-shot learning to inspire desired program generation [22,25]. Developing more effective agents capable of navigating codebases, locating documentation, and leveraging open-source libraries for tasks like machine learning remains a key area for advancement [11]. Multi-modal code generation is expected to become more widely used, and increasing the interpretability of models will be a significant trend [2].​  

The integration of NL2Code with program synthesis and formal verification techniques holds significant potential for improving code correctness and reliability [20]. Such integration could leverage the generative power of LLMs while benefiting from the formal guarantees and correctness checking offered by synthesis and verification methods, including advancements in areas like Automated Program Repair (APR) [20].​  

Emerging technologies and domains present exciting new avenues for NL2Code. The convergence of quantum computing and AI, particularly the development of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), offers opportunities to overcome classical computing limitations, with advancements in hardware and the integration of AI methodologies into QML highlighted as future directions [27]. AI's integration into domains like blockchain technology is also identified as a promising area for developing secure and decentralized applications [42]. Furthermore, there is a prediction for the emergence of more complex and powerful AI tools that could reshape the programming field, potentially allowing AI systems to replicate entire software development teams and collaborate on all aspects of software creation, achieving a high degree of automation [10]. These autonomous programming breakthroughs align with the concept of "digital employees" in coding [10,27].  

The field is witnessing a shift towards hybrid development models, where human developers and AI systems collaborate closely [2,4]. Human-computer collaboration is anticipated to become the mainstream paradigm [2]. Alongside this, the development of ethical and safety frameworks for AI coding is crucial, promoting responsible development and application in novel and increasingly complex environments [4,17]. Domain-specific models are expected to rise, focusing on optimizing performance and applications within particular fields like finance [5,40]. AI coding assistants are expected to continue improving, becoming more effective tools for developers and aiding in tasks like learning new programming languages by providing instant feedback [21,29].​  

Future research will also address challenges related to generalization and efficiency. While specific solutions like transfer learning and meta-learning for broad generalization challenges were not detailed in the digests, advancements in Transformer cross-language transfer technology, including optimization of attention mechanisms and pre-training methods, are noted for enhancing multilingual understanding and efficiency [26]. The increasing focus on application scenarios suggests a move towards making models more practical and efficient in real-world use [2]. Other architectural trends include edge AI, hybrid architectures, and the use of LLMs as core infrastructure, supported by million-token context windows [40].​  

Overall, future advancements promise more sophisticated code generation capabilities [15]. Opportunities exist in bridging the gap between academic research and practical developments in code generation using LLMs [37]. The field is poised for significant progress through improvements in model performance, evaluation rigor, integration with advanced programming techniques, exploration of emerging technologies, and the establishment of robust ethical and safety guidelines [34].  

# 10. Conclusion  

The landscape of Natural Language to Code (NL2Code) generation has been profoundly transformed by the advent and rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) [16,37]. These powerful models, leveraging extensive pre-training and sophisticated architectures, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding natural language intent and translating it into executable code across various programming languages [16,22,36]. As highlighted by numerous studies, LLM-powered code generation and auto-completion technologies are becoming a central paradigm in AI-assisted programming, significantly enhancing developer productivity and software development quality [2,15,21]. Specific domaintuned models, such as BloombergGPT for financial data querying, further illustrate the potential for LLMs to streamline specialized coding tasks [5]. This evolution is shifting AI assistance from basic code completion towards more comprehensive full-process management, promising a future where developers can concentrate on higher-level conceptual challenges [10].​  

Despite these significant strides, the field faces considerable challenges that necessitate continued research and development. A primary concern revolves around the accurate and comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance. Existing benchmarks have been shown to be often inadequate, lacking sufficient test cases or featuring flawed ground truth implementations, leading to an overestimation of model capabilities [3,8]. Furthermore, standard functional correctness metrics alone may not fully capture the practical value of generated code, as developers often prioritize factors like reduced overall effort, even if the code doesn't initially pass all tests [13]. This underscores the need for more sophisticated, hybrid evaluation metrics that better align with real-world developer needs and better frameworks like EvalPlus [3,13]. Another critical gap exists between performance on controlled benchmarks and real-world applicability, particularly when leveraging open-source libraries for complex tasks like machine learning [11]. While AI coding assistants are already proving helpful, they are still considered to be maturing, with developers anticipating further improvements [29]. Limitations persist in specific areas, such as the reliable detection of vulnerabilities in complex codebases like Solidity smart contracts [42].  

The importance of the NL2Code field cannot be overstated, given its immense potential to revolutionize software development, AI development, and potentially impact human cognitive processes through enhanced interaction with programming languages [2,10]. However, unlocking this potential requires addressing the identified challenges. Continued research is essential to improve model architectures, training data, and generation strategies [16], explore novel approaches like modality-relative pre-training [12], refine techniques for cross-lingual reasoning and few-shot learning [22], and develop more effective prompting paradigms like LMQL that integrate scripting and constraints [1].  

Crucially, the responsible development and deployment of AI coding assistants must be a priority [14,17,34]. This includes ensuring reliability, security, and safety through robust LLM observability and continuous monitoring [40]. Furthermore, developers should be cautioned against over-reliance, especially novice programmers, to foster a balanced approach [21]. The future of NL2Code lies in a synergy between human expertise and AI capabilities. Continued innovation in models, evaluation methodologies, and ethical considerations will be vital in realizing the full promise of this transformative technology.​
