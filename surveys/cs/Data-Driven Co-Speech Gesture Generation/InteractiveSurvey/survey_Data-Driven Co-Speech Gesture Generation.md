# 2 Introduction
The generation of co-speech gestures, which are non-verbal movements that accompany speech, is a critical component in the field of human-computer interaction and multimedia communication [1]. These gestures play a vital role in enhancing the naturalness and expressiveness of virtual agents, avatars, and robots, making interactions more engaging and intuitive [2]. Despite significant progress in recent years, the generation of high-quality, contextually appropriate, and temporally coherent co-speech gestures remains a challenging task [3]. This survey paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in data-driven co-speech gesture generation, with a particular focus on diffusion-based models and multimodal integration techniques [4].

This survey paper delves into the state-of-the-art methods for generating co-speech gestures, emphasizing the role of diffusion models and multimodal data integration [5]. Diffusion models, known for their ability to generate high-fidelity and diverse gestures, have shown remarkable potential in real-time applications [1]. These models leverage the iterative denoising process to synthesize gestures that are both semantically and rhythmically aligned with the input audio [2]. Additionally, the integration of multimodal inputs, such as audio, text, and visual data, has significantly enhanced the controllability and expressiveness of the generated gestures [1]. The paper also explores the challenges and solutions related to temporal consistency, smoothness, and the generation of emotionally expressive gestures.

The paper begins by examining the advancements in diffusion-based co-speech gesture generation, focusing on high-fidelity gesture synthesis and real-time performance [6]. Tailored diffusion models, which incorporate structured noise scheduling and latent space decomposition, have been pivotal in achieving these goals. These models not only generate high-quality gestures but also maintain temporal coherence and naturalness, making them suitable for real-time applications such as virtual avatars and robotic systems [7]. The integration of multimodal inputs, including audio, text, and motion, has further enhanced the controllability and expressiveness of the generated gestures, bridging the gap between high-quality generation and real-time performance [8].

Next, the paper discusses the importance of temporal consistency and smoothness in co-speech gesture generation [9]. Temporal attention mechanisms and motion stabilizers are crucial for ensuring that the generated gestures are temporally aligned and smooth [10]. These techniques help in capturing the temporal dynamics between speech and gestures, leading to more natural and contextually appropriate movements [11]. The paper also highlights the role of fast out-painting methods and diffusion gesture stabilizers in generating continuous and coherent gesture sequences, which are essential for real-time applications [12].

The paper then explores the integration of multimodal data and the alignment of gestures with emotional and rhythmic cues [13]. Audio-visual fusion techniques, emotion modulation, and semantic and rhythmic alignment are discussed in detail. These methods ensure that the generated gestures not only match the spoken content in terms of meaning but also synchronize with the rhythm and prosody of the speech [14]. The use of large language models (LLMs) and rule-based algorithms for semantic gesture labeling further enhances the naturalness and context-awareness of the generated gestures [2].

Finally, the paper reviews the evaluation methods and user studies that have been conducted to assess the performance of co-speech gesture generation models [9]. Real-time user interaction, standardized evaluation frameworks, and large-scale user studies are essential for validating the effectiveness of these models. The paper emphasizes the importance of both objective metrics and subjective assessments in evaluating the quality and naturalness of the generated gestures [15].

The contributions of this survey paper are multifaceted. It provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in diffusion-based co-speech gesture generation, highlighting the key techniques and methodologies that have driven the field forward [6]. The paper also identifies the challenges and open problems in the area, offering insights into potential future research directions. By synthesizing the current state of the art and providing a detailed analysis of the latest research, this survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of co-speech gesture generation [9].

# 3 Diffusion-Based Co-Speech Gesture Generation

## 3.1 High-Fidelity Gesture Synthesis

### 3.1.1 Tailored Diffusion Models for Real-Time Generation
Tailored diffusion models for real-time generation represent a significant advancement in the field of co-speech gesture synthesis, addressing the inherent challenges of generating temporally coherent and diverse gestures in real-time [4]. These models leverage the iterative denoising process characteristic of diffusion models to synthesize high-quality gestures that are both semantically and rhythmically aligned with the input audio [6]. Unlike traditional generative models, such as autoencoders and GANs, diffusion models can capture the complex and high-dimensional nature of human motion, providing a more nuanced and realistic representation of gestures [2]. The key innovation lies in the ability to control the generation process through the manipulation of noise levels and the use of conditional inputs, such as audio features and text prompts, which guide the denoising process to produce contextually appropriate gestures [16].

To achieve real-time performance, recent approaches have focused on optimizing the diffusion process to reduce computational overhead without compromising the quality of the generated gestures [12]. Techniques such as accelerated rolling diffusion and structured noise scheduling have been introduced to enable efficient sampling, allowing the models to generate gestures at a rate suitable for real-time applications [12]. For instance, the Accelerated Rolling Diffusion framework employs a ladder-based noise scheduling strategy, which denoises multiple frames simultaneously, significantly improving the sampling efficiency [12]. This approach not only accelerates the generation process but also maintains the temporal coherence and naturalness of the gestures, making it suitable for applications such as virtual avatars and robotic systems [11].

Moreover, the integration of multimodal inputs, such as audio, text, and motion, into the diffusion process has further enhanced the controllability and expressiveness of the generated gestures [17]. By leveraging the semantic and rhythmic information from these inputs, diffusion models can produce gestures that are more contextually relevant and aligned with the speaker's intent [18]. For example, the CLIP-guided prompt-conditioned co-speech gesture synthesis system uses a CLIP model to extract semantically consistent latent representations from multimodal prompts, which are then used to condition the diffusion process [19]. This results in more diverse and stylistically consistent gestures, demonstrating the potential of diffusion models to bridge the gap between high-quality gesture generation and real-time performance [4].

### 3.1.2 Structured Noise Scheduling for Efficiency
Structured noise scheduling in diffusion models for co-speech gesture generation aims to enhance both the efficiency and the quality of the generated gestures [6]. Traditional diffusion models typically involve a fixed noise schedule, where noise is added and removed in a uniform manner across all frames. However, this approach can be computationally expensive and may not optimally capture the temporal dynamics of human gestures [10]. To address these issues, recent research has focused on developing structured noise scheduling strategies that adapt the noise addition and removal processes to the specific characteristics of the gesture sequences.

One notable approach is the Rolling Diffusion Ladder Acceleration (RDLA) framework, which employs a structured ladder-based noise scheduling strategy. In RDLA, multiple frames are denoised simultaneously, allowing for a more efficient sampling process. This method leverages the temporal coherence of gesture sequences by grouping frames that share similar characteristics, thereby reducing the computational overhead associated with sequential denoising [6]. By doing so, RDLA not only accelerates the generation process but also maintains the temporal consistency of the generated gestures, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Another key innovation in structured noise scheduling is the use of adaptive noise schedules that dynamically adjust based on the content of the input audio and the current state of the gesture sequence. For example, the DiffSHEG framework introduces an annealed noise sampling strategy, where the noise level is gradually adjusted during the denoising process to ensure that the generated gestures remain synchronized with the audio. This adaptive approach helps to mitigate temporal inconsistencies that can arise from using a fixed noise schedule, leading to more natural and coherent gesture generation. Additionally, the use of structured noise scheduling in these frameworks allows for the generation of longer and smoother motion sequences, which is crucial for applications such as real-time avatar animation and robotic gesture control.

### 3.1.3 Latent Space Decomposition for Controllability
Latent space decomposition plays a pivotal role in achieving controllability in co-speech gesture generation, enabling the separation of distinct aspects of the generated gestures, such as style, content, and timing [18]. By decomposing the latent space, models can independently manipulate these factors, leading to more precise and nuanced control over the generated gestures [7]. This is particularly important in multi-modal settings where gestures need to be aligned with both speech and audio. Techniques such as contrastive learning and disentangled representation learning are employed to ensure that the latent space captures the essential relationships between different modalities while maintaining the separability of these components.

One effective approach to latent space decomposition is the use of contrastive learning, which has been successfully applied in models like CLIP. In the context of co-speech gesture generation, contrastive learning helps in constructing a shared latent space where different modalities (e.g., text, audio, and motion) are aligned [13]. This alignment ensures that the latent representations are semantically consistent across modalities, facilitating the generation of gestures that are both semantically and rhythmically aligned with the input speech and audio [8]. For instance, the GestureDiffuCLIP framework leverages the CLIP latent space to enable users to specify desired content and style through text prompts, thereby enhancing the controllability of the generated gestures.

Another key technique is the use of disentangled representation learning, which aims to separate the latent space into distinct subspaces, each responsible for a specific aspect of the gesture. This disentanglement is crucial for achieving fine-grained control over the generated gestures. For example, the MambaGesture framework employs a multi-modality feature fusion module (SEAD) and a Mamba-based attention block (MambaAttn) to disentangle the latent space, allowing for the independent manipulation of gesture style, content, and timing [1]. By integrating these techniques, the model can generate diverse and realistic gestures that are well-aligned with the input modalities, thereby addressing the limitations of previous methods that often suffer from poor diversity and inefficient generation processes [20].

## 3.2 Temporal Consistency and Smoothness

### 3.2.1 Temporal Attention Mechanisms for Coherence
Temporal attention mechanisms play a crucial role in ensuring the coherence of co-speech gestures by effectively capturing the temporal dynamics between speech and gestures [3]. These mechanisms allow models to focus on relevant time steps in the input sequence, thereby improving the alignment and synchronization of generated gestures with the spoken content [13]. By leveraging attention, models can dynamically weigh the importance of different temporal segments, which is particularly useful in handling the one-to-many mapping between speech and gestures, where multiple gesture variations can correspond to the same spoken content [4]. This dynamic weighting helps in generating more natural and contextually appropriate gestures.

In the context of co-speech gesture generation, temporal attention mechanisms are often combined with self-attention and cross-local attention to capture both global and local temporal dependencies [4]. Self-attention allows the model to understand the internal structure of the gesture sequence, ensuring smooth and continuous motion [21]. Cross-local attention, on the other hand, helps in aligning the local context of gestures with the corresponding speech segments, ensuring that the generated gestures are semantically and rhythmically aligned with the spoken words. This dual attention mechanism is essential for generating high-quality, diverse, and temporally coherent gestures that enhance the overall communication experience [22].

Furthermore, the integration of temporal attention mechanisms with diffusion models has shown promising results in generating realistic and diverse co-speech gestures [4]. Diffusion models, which iteratively refine the gesture sequence by adding and removing noise, benefit from the temporal attention by maintaining the temporal consistency of the generated gestures throughout the refinement process [2]. This combination not only improves the quality and diversity of the generated gestures but also accelerates the convergence of the learning process, making it more efficient and scalable for real-time applications [8].

### 3.2.2 Fast Out-Painting for Real-Time Synthesis
Fast Out-Painting for Real-Time Synthesis (FOPPAS) is a novel method designed to address the computational inefficiencies and discontinuities often encountered in real-time gesture generation. Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed-length gesture sequences and post-processing to ensure continuity, FOPPAS leverages a partial autoregressive sampling approach to generate smooth, continuous motion sequences in real-time [17]. This method is particularly advantageous for applications requiring high frame rates and low latency, such as interactive avatars and real-time animation.

FOPPAS operates by extending the concept of out-painting, typically used in image generation, to the domain of motion synthesis. In this context, out-painting involves generating new segments of motion that seamlessly connect with existing segments, ensuring that the overall motion remains coherent and natural. The method achieves this by conditioning the generation process on a small window of the current motion, rather than the entire context, which significantly reduces computational overhead. This partial conditioning allows FOPPAS to maintain high generation speeds, often exceeding 30 frames per second (FPS) on standard hardware, while still producing high-quality, temporally coherent gestures.

The effectiveness of FOPPAS is further enhanced by its integration with a Transformer-based Unidirectional Expression-Gesture (UniEG) generator, which ensures a natural alignment between speech and motion [17]. The UniEG generator models the uni-directional flow from facial expressions to gestures, capturing the intricate dynamics between these modalities. This combination not only improves the realism and expressiveness of the generated gestures but also allows for real-time adjustments based on the speaker's expressions and the audio input [1]. Additionally, FOPPAS's ability to generate arbitrary long sequences without the need for post-processing makes it a compelling solution for real-time applications, offering both efficiency and flexibility [17].

### 3.2.3 Motion Stabilizers for Continuous Sequences
Motion stabilizers play a crucial role in the generation of continuous sequences for co-speech gesture synthesis, addressing the inherent challenges of temporal consistency and coherence [6]. These stabilizers are designed to ensure that the generated gestures not only align with the input audio and text but also maintain a smooth and natural progression over time. One of the primary challenges in this domain is the temporal alignment of gestures with speech, which is essential for realistic and contextually appropriate motion [22]. Traditional methods often struggle with this alignment, leading to jerky or disjointed gestures that fail to convey the intended expressive content.

To overcome these limitations, recent advancements have introduced diffusion-based models that incorporate motion stabilizers to enhance the temporal coherence of generated sequences. These models leverage the denoising process to gradually refine the gesture sequence, ensuring that each frame is consistent with the previous and subsequent frames [23]. The Diffusion Gesture Stabilizer, for instance, is a module designed to gradually reduce the noise discrepancy in the temporal dimension during the denoising phase [6]. This approach not only improves the smoothness of the generated gestures but also ensures that the motion remains aligned with the input audio and text throughout the sequence [24].

Furthermore, the integration of attention mechanisms and transformer-based architectures has significantly enhanced the capability of motion stabilizers to handle complex multi-modal data. By explicitly modeling the temporal relationships between frames, these stabilizers can effectively capture the subtle nuances of human motion, such as the fluid transitions between different gestures and the synchronization of gestures with speech rhythms [10]. This results in more realistic and contextually appropriate gestures, which are essential for applications in virtual avatars, robotics, and interactive systems [2]. The use of implicit classifier-free guidance further enhances the robustness of these models, allowing them to generate high-quality gestures even in the presence of varying input conditions [23].

## 3.3 Multimodal Integration and Contextual Alignment

### 3.3.1 Audio-Visual Fusion for Enhanced Realism
Audio-visual fusion plays a pivotal role in enhancing the realism of co-speech gesture generation, particularly in the context of virtual avatars and interactive technologies [25]. The integration of audio and visual modalities not only ensures that the generated gestures are temporally synchronized with speech but also captures the nuanced emotional and stylistic elements that are crucial for natural human interaction [1]. Recent advancements in multimodal learning, particularly the use of diffusion models and transformer architectures, have significantly improved the quality and diversity of synthesized gestures [1]. These models leverage the rich temporal and spectral information contained in audio to guide the generation of gestures, ensuring that the resulting movements are both realistic and contextually appropriate [26].

One of the key challenges in audio-visual fusion is the disentanglement of audio features to extract meaningful components such as style and emotion. Techniques like the Style and Emotion Aware Disentangled (SEAD) feature fusion module have been developed to address this issue. By separating the audio signal into distinct components, these methods enable the generation of gestures that reflect the speaker's unique style and emotional state. This disentanglement is crucial for creating gestures that are not only synchronized with the speech but also convey the intended emotional nuances, thereby enhancing the overall realism of the generated content [22]. Moreover, the use of cross-attention mechanisms in transformer models further refines the multimodal alignment, ensuring that the generated gestures are coherent with both the audio and text inputs.

To achieve high-fidelity and temporally consistent gesture generation, several frameworks have been proposed that integrate advanced audio processing techniques with sophisticated motion synthesis models [27]. For instance, the Masked Diffusion Transformer (MDT-A2G) framework combines the strengths of mask modeling and diffusion models to ensure the quality and diversity of co-speech gestures [25]. Similarly, the DiffuseStyleGesture model extends diffusion models with temporal information and cross-local attention to capture the intricate dynamics between audio and gestures [1]. These approaches not only improve the realism of the generated gestures but also enable fine-grained control over the style and emotion, making them highly suitable for applications in virtual avatars and interactive systems [11]. Overall, the integration of audio-visual fusion techniques represents a significant step forward in the field of co-speech gesture generation, paving the way for more natural and engaging human-computer interactions [8].

### 3.3.2 Emotion Modulation for Expressive Gestures
Emotion modulation in expressive gesture generation is a critical aspect of creating realistic and engaging virtual avatars [11]. The integration of emotional cues into gesture synthesis not only enhances the naturalness of the generated movements but also deepens the emotional connection between the avatar and the audience [11]. Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the development of models that can effectively map emotional states to corresponding gestures [19]. These models often leverage multi-modal data, including audio, text, and visual features, to capture the nuanced relationships between emotional states and gesture dynamics [1]. For instance, some approaches incorporate emotion labels as additional inputs to guide the generation process, ensuring that the generated gestures align with the intended emotional expression [10]. This is particularly important in applications such as virtual assistants, where the ability to convey empathy and emotional intelligence is crucial for user engagement.

The technical challenge in emotion modulation lies in the accurate and consistent translation of emotional states into expressive gestures. One common approach is to use conditional generative models, such as conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) or conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs), which can learn to generate gestures conditioned on both the audio input and the desired emotional state [10]. These models are trained on datasets that include annotated emotional labels, allowing them to learn the mappings between emotional states and gesture patterns. However, the effectiveness of these models depends heavily on the quality and diversity of the training data. To address this, researchers have developed techniques to augment the training data with synthetic emotional variations, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen emotional contexts. Additionally, the use of attention mechanisms and cross-modal fusion techniques has been shown to enhance the model's capacity to capture the intricate interdependencies between speech and gesture, leading to more coherent and expressive outputs [1].

Another key aspect of emotion modulation is the ability to control the intensity and style of the generated gestures. This is particularly important for creating personalized avatars that can adapt their gestures to different emotional contexts and user preferences. Some recent works have introduced methods for fine-grained control over gesture generation, such as using style transfer techniques to modulate the intensity and style of gestures independently of the emotional content. These methods often involve disentangling the emotional and stylistic components of the input data, allowing for more flexible and controllable gesture synthesis. Furthermore, the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques has shown promise in optimizing the generated gestures for specific emotional goals, such as maximizing the perceived expressiveness or minimizing the cognitive load on the viewer. Overall, the ongoing research in emotion modulation for expressive gestures is paving the way for more natural and engaging virtual interactions [10].

### 3.3.3 Semantic and Rhythmic Alignment for Naturalness
Semantic and rhythmic alignment is a critical aspect of generating natural co-speech gestures [2]. The alignment ensures that the generated gestures not only match the spoken content in terms of meaning but also synchronize with the rhythm and prosody of the speech [13]. Beat gestures, which are rhythmic and often prosodically aligned, are relatively easier to model due to their consistent temporal patterns [28]. However, semantic gestures, which convey specific meanings and are more context-dependent, pose a greater challenge [18]. These gestures require a deeper understanding of the spoken content and the ability to generate appropriate, contextually relevant movements [4].

To address the challenge of semantic alignment, recent methods have integrated multimodal inputs, such as text and audio, to guide the generation of gestures [8]. For instance, multimodal masked autoregressive models (MMAG) and motion-text-audio-aligned variational autoencoders (MTA-VAE) have been proposed to capture the intricate relationships between speech, text, and gesture [13]. These models leverage pre-trained embeddings from audio and text to enhance the semantic coherence of the generated gestures [24]. By aligning these modalities, the models can better understand the context and generate more meaningful and contextually appropriate gestures. Additionally, the use of contrastive learning and reinforcement learning helps in refining the generated gestures, ensuring they are both semantically accurate and rhythmically synchronized [13].

Rhythmic alignment, on the other hand, involves ensuring that the gestures match the timing and prosody of the speech. This is achieved by extracting rhythm features from the audio, such as Mel spectrograms, which capture the temporal dynamics of the speech. These features are then integrated into the gesture generation process to ensure that the generated movements are synchronized with the speech rhythm [11]. Furthermore, the introduction of a Diffusion Gesture Stabilizer module helps in maintaining temporal consistency by gradually reducing noise discrepancies in the temporal dimension [6]. This approach not only enhances the naturalness of the gestures but also ensures that they are temporally coherent, leading to more realistic and engaging co-speech interactions [1].

# 4 LLM-Enhanced Co-Speech Gesture Generation

## 4.1 Multimodal Data Integration

### 4.1.1 Graph-Based Models for Real-Time Head Pose Generation
Graph-based models for real-time head pose generation represent a significant advancement in the field of non-verbal behavior generation, particularly in the context of listener responses during dyadic interactions [29]. These models leverage the structural relationships between different nodes (e.g., facial landmarks, head orientation) to predict continuous head motion sequences. Unlike traditional rule-based or hand-crafted methods, graph-based models can capture the complex dynamics of head movements in a data-driven manner, making them highly adaptable to various speakers and contexts [29]. The key advantage of these models lies in their ability to run in real-time, which is crucial for applications such as virtual agents, avatars, and interactive systems where immediate feedback is essential.

The proposed graph-based end-to-end model for head pose generation typically employs an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder processes the input speech signal to extract relevant features, and the decoder generates the corresponding head pose angles (roll, pitch, yaw) for the listener [29]. This approach eliminates the need for manual annotations, making it more scalable and practical for real-world applications. The model's efficiency is further enhanced by its ability to generalize across different speakers, thereby reducing the dependency on speaker-specific training data. The average absolute error of 4.5 degrees in head pose prediction demonstrates the model's accuracy and robustness, making it suitable for high-fidelity applications.

To achieve real-time performance, the model utilizes graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to efficiently propagate information across the graph structure, ensuring that the generated head poses are smooth and natural. The use of GCNs allows the model to capture both local and global dependencies in the head motion, leading to more realistic and contextually appropriate responses. Additionally, the model's ability to generate head pose sequences at a rate of 86 frames per second (fps) ensures that the generated motion is fluid and responsive, enhancing the overall user experience in interactive systems. This real-time capability, combined with the model's generalization and accuracy, positions graph-based models as a promising solution for real-time head pose generation in various multimedia applications.

### 4.1.2 Synthetic Datasets for Situated Gestures
Synthetic datasets for situated gestures are essential for advancing the field of co-speech gesture generation, particularly in scenarios where spatial context plays a crucial role [16]. These datasets are designed to augment existing co-speech datasets with multimodal referring expressions, thereby enabling the generation of gestures that are not only synchronized with speech but also contextually appropriate within a given environment [16]. The creation of such datasets involves the integration of speech, motion, and scene information, which is a significant step forward from traditional datasets that primarily focus on speech and motion modalities. By incorporating scene information, these synthetic datasets provide a richer and more comprehensive training ground for generative models, facilitating the development of more sophisticated and context-aware gesture generation systems [16].

One of the key challenges in generating situated gestures is the need to accurately model the relationship between speech, gesture, and environmental context [22]. Traditional datasets often lack the necessary spatial information, making it difficult to train models that can produce gestures that are both semantically meaningful and spatially relevant [30]. To address this, synthetic datasets are constructed by simulating various environments and scenarios, and then annotating the data with detailed spatial and contextual information. This process often involves the use of advanced simulation tools and virtual reality (VR) platforms, which allow for the creation of highly realistic and diverse training samples. These synthetic datasets are then used to train deep learning models, such as neural networks and transformers, which can learn to generate gestures that are not only synchronized with speech but also appropriately situated within the environment.

The development of synthetic datasets for situated gestures has opened up new research directions and applications [31]. For instance, these datasets can be used to train virtual agents and robots to perform more natural and engaging interactions in augmented reality (AR) and VR environments. Additionally, they can be leveraged to improve the realism of characters in video games and animated films, where the ability to generate contextually appropriate gestures is crucial for enhancing the viewer's immersion [32]. Despite these advancements, there remain several challenges, such as the need for more diverse and large-scale datasets, the development of more efficient and scalable training methods, and the refinement of evaluation metrics that can accurately assess the quality and appropriateness of generated gestures in situated contexts [33]. Future research in this area is likely to focus on addressing these challenges and further advancing the state of the art in co-speech gesture generation [9].

### 4.1.3 Rule-Based Algorithms for Semantic Gesture Labeling
Rule-based algorithms for semantic gesture labeling are foundational in the field of co-speech gesture generation, providing a structured and interpretable approach to mapping linguistic content to appropriate gestures [28]. These algorithms typically rely on a set of predefined rules that capture the relationship between specific words or phrases and corresponding gestures [3]. For example, certain nouns or verbs might be mapped to iconic gestures that visually represent the object or action being described [18]. Similarly, deictic gestures, which point to objects or locations, can be generated based on the presence of demonstrative pronouns or spatial references in the text [18]. The advantage of rule-based methods lies in their ability to produce gestures that are semantically aligned with the speech content, ensuring that the generated gestures are meaningful and contextually appropriate [4].

However, rule-based algorithms face several limitations. The primary challenge is the manual effort required to define and refine the rules, which can be time-consuming and requires domain expertise. Additionally, the rules are often static and may not capture the dynamic and context-dependent nature of natural gestures. For instance, the same word might be associated with different gestures depending on the broader context of the conversation [34]. To address these limitations, hybrid approaches that combine rule-based algorithms with data-driven methods have been proposed. In these hybrid systems, rule-based algorithms can be used to generate a baseline set of gestures, while data-driven models can refine and adapt these gestures based on the specific context and speaker characteristics [32]. This combination leverages the interpretability and semantic accuracy of rule-based methods with the flexibility and generalizability of data-driven models.

Furthermore, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for enhancing rule-based gesture labeling [28]. LLMs can be used to extract semantic and contextual information from text, which can then be used to inform the rule-based generation of gestures [2]. For example, LLMs can identify the parts of speech that are most likely to be gestured, as well as the type of gesture that would be most appropriate [19]. This integration of LLMs with rule-based algorithms can lead to more nuanced and contextually rich gesture generation, bridging the gap between the structured nature of rule-based systems and the dynamic complexity of natural human communication [28].

## 4.2 Sequence-to-Sequence Translation

### 4.2.1 LLMs for Text and Audio to Gesture Translation
In recent advancements, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into gesture animation models has opened new avenues for generating natural and contextually appropriate gestures [28]. Specifically, the use of Llama2 features has been shown to significantly enhance the quality of gesture animations, particularly when combined with audio features [14]. This combination is processed through a Transformer-XL architecture, which facilitates the effective integration of linguistic and acoustic information. The resulting system, termed Llanimation, generates gestures that not only capture the rhythmic aspects of speech (beat gestures) but also convey semantic content (semantic gestures) [11]. The effectiveness of LLM features is further demonstrated through objective and perceptual evaluations, which indicate that LLM features alone contribute more to the perceived quality of gestures than audio features [14].

The integration of LLMs into gesture generation models addresses a critical gap in the field, particularly in the context of multi-person conversational interactions [35]. Traditional models often focus on single-speaker scenarios, which limits their applicability to real-world conversations. Llanimation, by leveraging LLMs, can generate gestures that reflect the semantic content of both the main speaker and the interlocutor, thereby enhancing the naturalness and coherence of the generated gestures [14]. This is particularly challenging due to the need to synchronize the gestures with the speech of multiple speakers while maintaining the semantic integrity of the conversation [35]. The results from our evaluations show that LLMs are capable of capturing the nuanced interactions and context-switching that occur in multi-person dialogues, leading to more realistic and engaging gesture animations.

Moreover, the use of LLMs in gesture generation offers a scalable and adaptable solution that can be applied across various domains, including virtual humans, digital avatars, and interactive agents [36]. The ability of LLMs to understand and generate gestures based on the linguistic structure of utterances, as well as their capacity to predict gesture types, makes them a powerful tool for creating more human-like interactions [36]. Additionally, the proposed inference-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach allows for the local integration of semantic gestures into the generated motion, providing a fine-grained control over the gesture generation process [37]. This approach not only enhances the quality of the generated gestures but also enables the system to adapt to specific contexts and user preferences, thereby improving the overall user experience [7].

### 4.2.2 Two-Stage Training for Unified Modalities
In the realm of co-speech gesture generation, the integration of multiple modalities, such as audio and text, has been a focal point for enhancing the semantic and prosodic richness of generated gestures [4]. A two-stage training framework has emerged as a promising approach to unify these modalities effectively. The first stage involves pre-training a large language model (LLM) to align various modalities, including compositional body motion, audio, and text. This pre-training step is crucial as it enables the model to learn the intricate relationships between different modalities, thereby improving its ability to generate gestures that are both contextually appropriate and semantically rich.

Following the pre-training phase, the second stage of the training pipeline focuses on fine-tuning the model to perform specific downstream tasks [26]. This is achieved by compiling the tasks into detailed instructions and training the model to follow these instructions accurately [26]. The fine-tuning process is designed to leverage the semantic understanding and multimodal alignment capabilities developed during the pre-training phase, allowing the model to generate gestures that are not only natural and rhythmic but also highly contextually relevant. This two-stage approach ensures that the model can handle a wide range of input modalities and generate diverse, high-quality gestures that align well with the input speech and text [37].

The effectiveness of this two-stage training framework has been validated through extensive experiments and user studies. The results demonstrate that the model, when trained using this approach, outperforms previous methods in terms of gesture naturalness, rhythmicity, and contextual appropriateness [38]. Moreover, the ability to control gesture generation through text prompts opens up new possibilities for applications in virtual humans, digital avatars, and interactive systems, where the generation of contextually rich and semantically accurate gestures is crucial [11]. This framework represents a significant step forward in the field of co-speech gesture generation, bridging the gap between semantic understanding and multimodal gesture synthesis [9].

### 4.2.3 Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Contextual Richness
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful technique to enhance the contextual richness of generated gestures by integrating external knowledge into the generation process [37]. Unlike traditional generative models that rely solely on the internal parameters learned from training data, RAG leverages a retrieval mechanism to fetch contextually relevant examples from a large database. This approach ensures that the generated gestures are not only natural and semantically consistent but also grounded in real-world examples, thereby improving the overall quality and diversity of the output [7].

In the context of gesture generation, RAG-GESTURE is a notable framework that employs a diffusion model to synthesize gestures [2]. The key innovation lies in the retrieval step, where the model identifies and injects context-appropriate exemplars into the generation process. These exemplars are selected based on their semantic similarity to the input text or audio, ensuring that the generated gestures align well with the intended meaning and context. The use of a diffusion model further enhances the diversity and naturalness of the gestures by allowing for stochastic sampling, which can produce a range of plausible motions for the same input [25].

The effectiveness of RAG-GESTURE is supported by empirical evaluations, which demonstrate that the retrieval of contextually relevant exemplars significantly improves the semantic accuracy and naturalness of the generated gestures [37]. This is particularly important in applications such as virtual agents and robotics, where the ability to generate contextually rich and semantically accurate gestures can greatly enhance the user experience [2]. Moreover, the modular design of RAG-GESTURE allows for easy integration with existing gesture generation pipelines, making it a versatile tool for researchers and practitioners in the field.

## 4.3 User Studies and Evaluation

### 4.3.1 Real-Time User Interaction for Perceptual Assessment
Real-time user interaction plays a pivotal role in the perceptual assessment of co-speech gesture generation, particularly in evaluating the appropriateness and naturalness of synthesized gestures [9]. Traditional offline evaluation methods often fail to capture the dynamic and interactive nature of human communication, which is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of gesture generation models [15]. To address this, several studies have developed interactive testbeds that allow users to engage with virtual agents or robots in real-time, providing immediate feedback on the generated gestures [39]. These testbeds typically involve a combination of speech-driven gesture generation models and real-time rendering systems, enabling users to observe and rate the gestures as they are produced [23].

One of the key challenges in real-time user interaction for perceptual assessment is ensuring that the generated gestures are both semantically meaningful and temporally aligned with the speech [7]. This alignment is critical for maintaining the natural flow of conversation and enhancing user engagement. Recent advancements in multimodal deep learning, particularly the integration of large language models (LLMs) with gesture generation frameworks, have shown promise in addressing this challenge [14]. For instance, LLMs can provide rich semantic context that helps in generating more contextually appropriate gestures. Additionally, the use of diffusion models and transformers has enabled the generation of diverse and high-quality gestures in real-time, further improving the user experience [1].

To validate the effectiveness of these real-time systems, extensive user studies have been conducted, often involving large-scale evaluations with diverse participant groups. These studies typically employ a combination of objective metrics, such as motion quality and synchronization accuracy, and subjective assessments, such as user ratings of gesture appropriateness and naturalness. The results from these studies have provided valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of current gesture generation models, highlighting areas for future improvement [38]. Moreover, the development of standardized evaluation protocols and the sharing of benchmark datasets have facilitated reproducibility and comparability across different research efforts, driving the field forward.

### 4.3.2 Standardized Evaluation Frameworks for Fair Comparison
Standardized evaluation frameworks are crucial for the fair and reproducible comparison of gesture generation models [38]. These frameworks typically encompass both objective and subjective evaluation methods, ensuring that the performance of different models can be assessed consistently. Objective metrics, such as joint position and velocity errors, provide quantitative measures of how closely the generated gestures match the ground truth. However, these metrics alone are insufficient to capture the human perception of gesture quality. Therefore, subjective evaluations, often conducted through user studies, are essential to assess the perceived naturalness, appropriateness, and human-likeness of the generated gestures [15]. These studies typically involve participants rating the quality of gestures or comparing different models in a controlled setting [7].

To ensure the reliability and validity of these evaluations, standardized datasets and evaluation protocols are employed. For instance, the GENEA Challenge 2022 provides a common dataset and a standardized 3D model for all participants, facilitating direct comparisons. The challenge also includes a detailed evaluation pipeline that combines objective metrics with subjective assessments [33]. This pipeline helps in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of different models, thereby guiding future research and development. Additionally, the challenge encourages participants to document their methods and results, promoting transparency and reproducibility in the field.

The integration of multiple evaluation metrics and methods is critical for a comprehensive assessment of gesture generation models [15]. For example, the combination of joint velocity and position errors with user studies can provide a more holistic view of a model's performance. Furthermore, the use of large-scale user studies, involving diverse participants, ensures that the evaluations are representative and generalize well across different contexts and user groups. By adopting such a multi-faceted approach, standardized evaluation frameworks not only facilitate fair comparisons but also drive the advancement of gesture generation technology towards more natural and context-appropriate interactions [15].

### 4.3.3 Large-Scale User Studies for System Performance
Large-scale user studies are essential for evaluating the performance and effectiveness of gesture generation systems, particularly when integrating advanced models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) [2]. These studies provide valuable insights into the perceived quality and naturalness of generated gestures, which are crucial for the development of realistic and engaging virtual agents [2]. In our research, we conducted four large-scale user studies to assess the performance of our gesture generation model, which integrates LLM features with audio features [14]. The studies were designed to evaluate the system on a common dataset using a standardized 3D model and rendering method, ensuring that all other sources of variation were controlled for, thus allowing for a fair and comprehensive comparison of different models.

The first user study focused on the subjective assessment of gesture appropriateness for speech, a critical aspect of co-speech gesture generation [10]. We developed a novel method to control for the human-likeness of the motion, which is a common confounding factor in such evaluations. Participants were asked to rate the appropriateness of gestures generated by our model in response to various speech inputs [7]. The results indicated that LLM features significantly contributed to the perceived quality of the gestures, outperforming models that relied solely on audio features [14]. This finding underscores the importance of semantic understanding in generating contextually appropriate gestures [18].

In the second study, we compared gestures generated directly in 3D with those generated in 2D and then lifted to 3D [30]. This comparison was crucial for understanding the impact of the generation method on the perceived quality of the gestures [15]. Participants were asked to choose between the two types of gestures, and the results showed a clear preference for gestures generated directly in 3D [30]. This preference was attributed to the higher fidelity and naturalness of the 3D-generated gestures, which better synchronized with the speech dynamics and conveyed more accurate semantic information [9]. These findings highlight the importance of developing models that can generate high-quality gestures directly in 3D, which is essential for creating immersive and realistic virtual interactions [9].

# 5 Self-Supervised and Multimodal Co-Speech Gesture Generation

## 5.1 Unified Datasets and Representations

### 5.1.1 Standardized Co-Speech Gesture Datasets
Standardized co-speech gesture datasets play a crucial role in advancing the field of co-speech gesture generation [7]. These datasets provide the necessary foundation for training and evaluating models that aim to synthesize realistic and contextually appropriate gestures [27]. One of the primary challenges in this domain is the heterogeneity and variability of existing datasets, which often differ in terms of data representation, annotation standards, and the scope of captured gestures [30]. For instance, some datasets focus on upper-body movements, while others include full-body representations, leading to inconsistencies that hinder direct comparison and integration of research findings.

To address these issues, several efforts have been made to standardize co-speech gesture datasets [3]. The BEAT dataset, for example, is one of the most comprehensive resources available, offering a rich collection of mocap data with diverse modalities. However, the data in BEAT is not uniformly formatted, making it difficult to use across different research projects. This has led to the need for a standardized benchmark that can serve as a common reference point for the community. Such a benchmark would include standardized data formats, consistent annotation protocols, and a unified set of evaluation metrics, ensuring that research contributions are comparable and reproducible.

The development of a standardized benchmark for co-speech gesture datasets is essential for advancing the state-of-the-art in gesture generation [7]. It would facilitate the integration of various sub-areas, such as audio-to-body, audio-to-face, and body-to-hands, by providing a common framework for data representation and evaluation. This standardization would also enable researchers to focus on developing more sophisticated models and algorithms, rather than spending time on data preprocessing and format conversion. Ultimately, a well-standardized dataset would accelerate the pace of innovation and help overcome the current limitations in generating diverse, natural, and contextually relevant co-speech gestures [3].

### 5.1.2 Multi-Head Self-Attention for Robust Generation
Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) has emerged as a powerful mechanism for enhancing the robustness and quality of co-speech gesture generation. Unlike traditional single-head attention mechanisms, MHSA allows the model to focus on multiple aspects of the input simultaneously, thereby capturing a richer and more nuanced representation of the data. In the context of co-speech gesture generation, MHSA enables the model to attend to different parts of the speech signal and the corresponding visual cues, ensuring that the generated gestures are not only synchronized with the speech but also expressive and contextually appropriate [1]. This is particularly important for generating natural and realistic gestures, as it allows the model to consider various temporal and spatial dependencies that are crucial for conveying the intended meaning and emotional content [1].

The proposed MHSA-based encoder in our model is designed to handle the multimodal nature of co-speech gesture generation, where inputs include both audio and text modalities [39]. By employing multiple heads, each head can specialize in attending to specific features or patterns within the input, such as the prosodic elements of speech, the semantic content of the text, or the temporal dynamics of the gesture sequence. This specialization leads to a more fine-grained and context-aware representation, which is essential for generating high-quality gestures that are both coherent and diverse [25]. Moreover, the use of MHSA helps mitigate the issue of noisy or missing input modalities, as the model can dynamically adjust its attention to focus on the most reliable and informative parts of the input.

To further enhance the robustness of the MHSA-based encoder, we introduce a self-supervised pre-training method that leverages large amounts of unannotated data to learn meaningful representations of the input modalities. This pre-training step is crucial for improving the generalization capabilities of the model, especially in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. During the pre-training phase, the model learns to align the latent representations of the audio and text modalities, ensuring that they are semantically consistent and complementary. Once the model is fine-tuned on a smaller labeled dataset, it demonstrates superior performance in generating co-speech gestures that are not only synchronized with the speech but also exhibit a high degree of naturalness and expressiveness [3].

### 5.1.3 Pretrained Encoders for Joint Embedding Spaces
Pretrained encoders play a crucial role in creating joint embedding spaces for co-speech gesture generation, enabling the seamless integration of multiple modalities such as speech, text, and pose [39]. These encoders are typically trained using large-scale datasets and self-supervised learning strategies to capture the intricate relationships between different modalities. By leveraging pretrained encoders, models can effectively learn robust and generalizable representations that facilitate the generation of high-quality co-speech gestures [26]. For instance, the Multimodal Pretrained Encoder for Gesture generation (MPE4G) utilizes a BERT-style self-supervised learning approach to train a multimodal encoder that can handle text, speech, and pose data [39]. This encoder is designed to create a joint embedding space where the features from different modalities are aligned, allowing for coherent and contextually appropriate gesture generation.

The use of pretrained encoders in joint embedding spaces also addresses the challenge of limited annotated data by leveraging large, unlabeled datasets. This is particularly important in the context of co-speech gesture generation, where fully supervised datasets are often expensive and labor-intensive to create [26]. By pretraining on large amounts of unannotated data, these encoders can learn rich, hierarchical representations that capture the underlying structure of the data. For example, the VariationCompensation Style Encoder (VCSE) module in the VarGes framework employs a transformer-based encoder with an additive self-attention pooling layer to robustly encode style clips into deep learning representations [30]. This allows the model to augment gesture diversity and expressiveness by capturing stylistic variations from style-reference videos, thereby enhancing the naturalness and variability of the generated gestures [30].

Furthermore, pretrained encoders in joint embedding spaces enable the model to handle the temporal dynamics of co-speech gestures more effectively [13]. By incorporating temporal self-attention mechanisms, these encoders can model the temporal dependencies and smooth transitions between gestures, which are essential for generating realistic and fluid movements. For instance, the EMAGE framework uses a spatial and temporal transformer-based architecture to aggregate spatial features from masked body joints and reconstruct the latent space of pretrained gestures [27]. This design ensures that the generated gestures are not only contextually aligned with the input audio but also temporally coherent, leading to more natural and expressive co-speech gesture videos [40]. Overall, the use of pretrained encoders in joint embedding spaces represents a significant advancement in co-speech gesture generation, offering a powerful solution to the challenges of data scarcity and temporal modeling [39].

## 5.2 Stylistic and Emotional Gesture Generation

### 5.2.1 Emotion-Beat Mining for Vivid Gestures
In the realm of co-speech gesture generation, the alignment of gestures with emotional cues and audio beats is crucial for producing natural and engaging interactions [21]. The Emotion-Beat Mining (EBM) module is designed to address this challenge by extracting and leveraging both emotional and rhythmic information from the input audio. This module first processes the audio signal to identify key emotional features, such as pitch, intensity, and timbre, which are indicative of the speaker's emotional state. These features are then combined with audio beat detection to ensure that the generated gestures are not only emotionally congruent but also temporally aligned with the speech rhythm [1].

To enhance the temporal coherency and smoothness of the generated gestures, the EBM module is complemented by a Spatial-Temporal Prompter (STP). The STP generates a pose prompt that guides the gesture generation process, ensuring that the movements are fluid and natural. This is achieved by modeling the temporal dependencies between consecutive frames, which helps in maintaining the continuity of the gestures over time [12]. The STP also incorporates spatial constraints to ensure that the gestures are anatomically plausible and visually coherent. By integrating these spatial and temporal cues, the STP significantly reduces the pose jittering issues often observed in existing methods, leading to more realistic and vivid gesture sequences.

Finally, to introduce diversity and variability in the generated gestures, an emotion-conditioned Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is employed [21]. This VAE samples from a distribution of emotion-clustered features, allowing the generation of multiple gesture variations for the same input audio [21]. This approach not only enriches the emotional expressiveness of the gestures but also ensures that the generated movements are not confined to a single, repetitive pattern [23]. The combination of the EBM module, the STP, and the emotion-conditioned VAE forms a robust framework for generating vivid and diverse co-speech gestures, significantly advancing the state of the art in this domain.

### 5.2.2 Variation-Enhanced Feature Extraction for Diversity
Variation-Enhanced Feature Extraction (VEFE) is a critical component in the VarGes framework, designed to enrich the feature representation of speech by integrating stylistic cues from style-reference videos [30]. This module leverages StyleCLIPS, which are short video clips extracted from style-reference videos, to capture the unique gestural styles of different speakers. The VEFE module processes these StyleCLIPS by extracting 3D human keypoints and encoding them into deep learning representations. By doing so, it not only enhances the diversity of the generated gestures but also ensures that the gestures are contextually relevant and expressive, aligning closely with the speaker's style and the content of the speech [1].

The VEFE module employs a multi-step process to achieve this enhancement. Initially, it uses a pose estimation algorithm to extract 3D keypoints from the StyleCLIPS. These keypoints are then fed into a feature extraction network, which learns to encode the stylistic variations present in the gestures [30]. The encoded style features are subsequently merged with the speech-derived features using a cross-attention mechanism. This mechanism ensures that the style features are aligned with the temporal dynamics of the speech, leading to more coherent and natural-looking gestures [4]. The integration of style and speech features is crucial for generating gestures that are not only diverse but also contextually appropriate and expressive [22].

To further enhance the diversity and naturalness of the generated gestures, the VEFE module incorporates a variation-compensation mechanism. This mechanism addresses the issue of overfitting to specific styles by introducing a form of regularization that encourages the model to explore a broader range of gestural variations. By doing so, the VEFE module ensures that the generated gestures are not only diverse but also robust to variations in input speech and style-reference videos. This approach is particularly beneficial when working with "in-the-wild" datasets, which are characterized by their heterogeneity and uncontrolled environments. The VEFE module thus plays a pivotal role in VarGes, enabling the generation of high-quality, diverse, and contextually rich co-speech gestures.

### 5.2.3 Spatial-Temporal Prompting for Smooth Transitions
Spatial-Temporal Prompting (STP) is a novel approach designed to enhance the smoothness and naturalness of co-speech gesture generation in video sequences [41]. Unlike traditional methods that often rely on padding or simple extrapolation of initial poses, STP leverages advanced prompt learning strategies to ensure a seamless transition between initial and future poses [21]. The core of STP lies in its ability to dynamically adjust and refine the motion trajectory based on both spatial and temporal information, thereby addressing the common issues of abrupt movements and unnatural transitions observed in earlier models.

The spatial-interpolation prompt learning strategy within STP plays a crucial role in maintaining spatial consistency across frames. By interpolating the embeddings of initial postures, this strategy guides the generation of each subsequent frame in a manner that ensures smooth spatial transitions. This is achieved through a learnable interpolation mechanism that updates the pose representations iteratively, aligning them with the initial pose while also considering the evolving motion dynamics. While effective in ensuring short-term spatial coherence, this strategy alone may not capture the long-term temporal dependencies necessary for natural gesture sequences [21].

To address this limitation, STP incorporates a temporal-reinforcement prompt learning strategy that complements the spatial-interpolation approach [21]. This strategy focuses on aggregating historical temporal changes to reinforce the temporal correlation between consecutive frames. By maintaining a running history of motion patterns, the temporal-reinforcement component helps to preserve the continuity and flow of gestures over longer sequences. Together, these two strategies enable STP to generate co-speech gestures that are not only spatially coherent but also temporally consistent, resulting in more natural and realistic video outputs [1].

## 5.3 Self-Supervised Learning Strategies

### 5.3.1 Deviation in Latent Representation for Fine-Grained Details
In the context of co-speech gesture generation, the deviation in latent representation plays a crucial role in capturing fine-grained details that contribute to the naturalness and expressiveness of the generated videos [41]. The deviation module, which is a core component of the proposed framework, is designed to generate latent representations for both the foreground (e.g., gestures) and background (e.g., environment) elements of the video [41]. This module consists of a latent deviation extractor, a warping calculator, and a latent deviation decoder. The latent deviation extractor is responsible for identifying and isolating the deviations in the input data, such as subtle changes in gesture dynamics or background movements, which are often overlooked in traditional models.

The warping calculator then computes the spatial and temporal transformations required to align these deviations with the input speech or text, ensuring that the generated gestures are synchronized with the spoken words. This alignment is critical for maintaining the coherence between the verbal and non-verbal components of the video. The latent deviation decoder subsequently reconstructs the fine-grained details from the extracted deviations, enhancing the realism of the generated gestures [1]. By integrating these components, the deviation module effectively captures the nuanced aspects of human motion, which are essential for high-quality video generation.

To further enhance the performance of the deviation module, a self-supervised learning strategy is employed. This strategy leverages the inherent structure of the data to train the model without the need for extensive labeled motion annotations, which are often costly and time-consuming to obtain. The self-supervised approach involves training the model to predict the deviations in the latent space, using the reconstructed gestures as a form of self-supervision [19]. This not only reduces the dependency on annotated data but also improves the model's ability to generalize to new and unseen data. Through this comprehensive approach, the proposed framework achieves superior results in generating co-speech gesture videos, demonstrating high-quality and natural-looking outputs that outperform existing state-of-the-art models [40].

### 5.3.2 2D to 3D Pose Lifting for Naturalness
In the realm of co-speech gesture generation, the transition from 2D to 3D pose lifting plays a crucial role in enhancing the naturalness and realism of synthesized gestures [9]. Traditional methods often rely on 2D pose estimation techniques, such as OpenPose, to extract skeletal keypoints from video frames. However, these 2D keypoints lack depth information, which is essential for generating realistic 3D gestures. To bridge this gap, researchers have developed various 2D to 3D pose lifting models, such as VideoPose3D, which can infer 3D joint positions from 2D keypoints. These models leverage deep learning architectures to learn the mapping between 2D and 3D poses, thereby enabling the generation of more natural and fluid 3D gestures [19].

One of the primary challenges in 2D to 3D pose lifting is the presence of noise and inaccuracies in the 2D keypoints, which can lead to jittering and discontinuities in the 3D pose sequences. To mitigate these issues, recent approaches have incorporated temporal consistency constraints and smoothing techniques. For instance, some methods use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to model the temporal dependencies in the pose sequences, ensuring smoother transitions between consecutive frames. Additionally, self-supervised learning strategies have been employed to refine the 3D pose estimates without requiring extensive labeled 3D data. These strategies often involve training the model to predict the 3D poses from 2D keypoints and then using the predicted 3D poses to reconstruct the original 2D keypoints, forming a closed-loop system that enhances the robustness of the pose lifting process.

Furthermore, the integration of audio and visual cues has emerged as a promising direction for improving the naturalness of 3D gesture generation [30]. By leveraging the temporal and semantic information contained in speech signals, these multimodal approaches can better synchronize the generated gestures with the spoken content, leading to more coherent and expressive animations [8]. For example, the proposed VarGes framework combines speech features with stylistic cues extracted from style-reference videos to generate diverse and lifelike 3D gestures [30]. This approach not only enhances the naturalness of the gestures but also allows for greater flexibility in adapting the generated motions to different contexts and styles, making it particularly suitable for applications in virtual agents and social robots [2].

### 5.3.3 Learning Algorithms for Efficient Motion Representation
Learning algorithms for efficient motion representation have become a focal point in the development of co-speech gesture generation systems, addressing the computational and supervisory challenges inherent in traditional approaches [16]. These algorithms aim to reduce the reliance on computationally intensive full supervision and large datasets by leveraging self-supervised and semi-supervised learning strategies. For instance, the deviation module, which includes a latent deviation extractor, a warping calculator, and a latent deviation decoder, is designed to generate latent representations of both foreground and background elements in a video. This modular approach not only enhances the efficiency of motion representation but also allows for the generation of more realistic and detailed co-speech gestures by capturing the subtle nuances of human movement [25].

To further improve the quality and efficiency of motion representation, recent methods have explored the use of advanced neural network architectures, such as multi-head self-attention-based encoders. These encoders are particularly adept at handling the temporal dependencies and spatial correlations in motion data, which are crucial for generating fluid and natural-looking gestures. Additionally, the introduction of self-supervised pre-training methods has significantly reduced the need for extensive labeled data, making it feasible to train models on large, unannotated datasets [19]. This shift towards self-supervised learning has not only lowered the labor costs associated with data annotation but also improved the robustness and generalizability of the generated gestures [19].

Moreover, the representation of motion in 3D has emerged as a key area of focus, as it provides a more expressive and detailed representation of human gestures compared to 2D representations [30]. The use of 3D joint rotation-based models has been particularly effective in capturing the full range of human movement, including the subtle dynamics of the center of gravity and the synchronization of local and global motions [39]. This approach has been further enhanced by the integration of style-reference videos, which allow for the extraction of stylistic cues and the generation of diverse and lifelike gestures [30]. By combining these advanced learning algorithms and 3D motion representation techniques, recent frameworks have achieved significant improvements in the realism and naturalness of co-speech gesture generation, paving the way for more sophisticated and engaging digital human animations [25].

# 6 Future Directions


Despite significant advancements in co-speech gesture generation, several limitations and gaps remain. Current models often struggle with generating gestures that are both semantically and emotionally aligned with the spoken content, particularly in complex and dynamic conversational contexts. The integration of multimodal data, while promising, still faces challenges in terms of temporal consistency and the naturalness of the generated gestures. Additionally, the generation of diverse and contextually appropriate gestures for different speakers and environments remains a significant challenge. Existing datasets are often limited in size and diversity, which hampers the development of more robust and generalizable models. Furthermore, the evaluation of co-speech gesture generation models is still largely subjective, and there is a need for more standardized and objective evaluation metrics.

To address these limitations, several directions for future research are proposed. First, the development of more sophisticated multimodal integration techniques is essential. This includes the exploration of advanced neural architectures, such as transformers and multimodal attention mechanisms, to better capture the intricate relationships between speech, text, and visual data. Additionally, the integration of emotional and stylistic cues into the generation process can enhance the expressiveness and naturalness of the generated gestures. For example, incorporating emotion recognition models and style transfer techniques could enable the generation of gestures that are not only contextually appropriate but also emotionally congruent with the speaker's intent.

Second, the creation of larger and more diverse datasets is crucial for training models that can generalize well across different contexts and speakers. This involves collecting and annotating data from a wide range of environments and speakers, including those with diverse cultural backgrounds and communication styles. The use of synthetic data generation techniques, such as data augmentation and simulation, can also help in expanding the available training data. Furthermore, the development of semi-supervised and self-supervised learning methods can reduce the dependency on large annotated datasets, making the training process more efficient and scalable.

Third, the improvement of temporal consistency and smoothness in gesture generation is another important area for future research. Techniques such as temporal attention mechanisms, motion stabilizers, and fast out-painting methods can be further refined to ensure that the generated gestures are temporally coherent and smooth. The use of reinforcement learning to optimize the generation process for specific criteria, such as naturalness and expressiveness, can also be explored. Additionally, the integration of physics-based models and biomechanical constraints can help in generating more realistic and anatomically plausible gestures.

The potential impact of the proposed future work is substantial. Enhancing the multimodal integration and emotional alignment of co-speech gestures can lead to more natural and engaging interactions in virtual agents, avatars, and robots. This can significantly improve user experiences in applications such as virtual assistants, educational tools, and entertainment systems. The development of larger and more diverse datasets will enable the creation of more robust and generalizable models, which can be deployed in a variety of real-world scenarios. Finally, improving the temporal consistency and smoothness of generated gestures will enhance the realism and credibility of virtual characters, making them more relatable and effective in human-computer interactions. Overall, these advancements will contribute to the broader goal of creating more human-like and contextually aware virtual agents, thereby transforming the landscape of human-computer interaction.
