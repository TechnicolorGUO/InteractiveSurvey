# Comprehensive Survey on Data-Driven Co-Speech Gesture Generation

## 1 Foundations and Theoretical Background

### 1.1 Definition and Importance of Co-Speech Gestures

Co-speech gestures, defined as non-verbal hand and arm movements that accompany spoken language, play a pivotal role in human communication. These gestures provide additional information that complements verbal messages, enhancing both understanding and interaction quality. As outlined in "A Comprehensive Review of Data-Driven Co-Speech Gesture Generation" [1], co-speech gestures encompass various communicative functions, such as iconic gestures (representing concrete objects or actions), metaphoric gestures (conveying abstract ideas), deictic gestures (pointing to specific entities), and beat gestures (synchronizing with speech rhythm). This diversity highlights their importance in embodied human communication, enabling individuals to express emotions, emphasize points, clarify ideas, and maintain engagement during conversations.

The significance of co-speech gestures in communication cannot be overstated. They serve as a natural extension of speech, allowing speakers to leverage multiple modalities simultaneously for more effective communication. Studies have demonstrated that the use of appropriate gestures while speaking improves listener comprehension and retention compared to purely verbal interactions [2] [1]. This multimodal synergy facilitates clearer expression and reception of ideas. Furthermore, co-speech gestures contribute to building rapport and trust between interlocutors; speakers who use expressive gestures are often perceived as more confident, engaging, and trustworthy than those relying solely on verbal communication [3] [1].

Beyond enhancing clarity and fostering rapport, co-speech gestures also enrich emotional expressivity. Emotional cues embedded within gestures amplify the tone of a message, whether it conveys excitement, frustration, or empathy. As discussed in "Understanding Gesture and Speech Multimodal Interactions for Manipulation Tasks in Augmented Reality Using Unconstrained Elicitation" [1], the timing alignment between speech and gestures reveals much about the speaker's emotional state and intent. For example, gestures preceding speech may indicate anticipation, while simultaneous gestures might reflect immediacy or urgency. Such nuances make interpersonal interactions feel more authentic and dynamic.

Additionally, co-speech gestures bridge gaps in linguistic proficiency, particularly in cross-cultural or multilingual settings. When vocabulary or grammar differences hinder effective communication, gestures act as universal tools for conveying meaning. Iconic gestures can mimic actions to demonstrate processes, and deictic gestures can clarify spatial relationships without elaborate verbal explanations [4] [1].

From an application perspective, the importance of co-speech gestures extends into specialized domains like education, healthcare, and entertainment. Virtual avatars and social robots with realistic co-speech gesture generation capabilities enhance user experiences by becoming more relatable and believable. In educational contexts, virtual instructors capable of demonstrating concepts through gestures could improve learning outcomes. Similarly, in therapeutic settings, socially assistive robots utilizing co-speech gestures could encourage active patient engagement during rehabilitation sessions [5] [1].

Despite their evident importance, generating realistic co-speech gestures remains challenging due to their complexity and variability. Unlike periodic motions such as walking, co-speech gestures are idiosyncratic and influenced by individual styles, cultural norms, and contextual factors. Moreover, there is a many-to-one relationship between spoken words and possible accompanying gestures, complicating deterministic modeling efforts [6] [1].

To tackle these challenges, researchers increasingly employ data-driven approaches using deep learning techniques. By leveraging large datasets of human demonstrations, these methods aim to learn latent mappings between speech and corresponding gestures. Modern architectures, such as transformers, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and diffusion models, have shown promise in synthesizing diverse and contextually relevant co-speech gestures [7] [1]. However, ensuring temporal synchronization, preserving semantic coherence, and accommodating personalized styles remain significant hurdles.

Ultimately, studying co-speech gestures illuminates how humans communicate and informs the development of advanced technologies replicating this ability artificially. Their critical role in augmenting verbal expression underscores the need for further exploration of the mechanisms underlying gesture production and perception. Through interdisciplinary collaboration involving linguistics, psychology, computer science, and robotics, future innovations promise to create more naturalistic and engaging interactions between humans and machines. Thus, understanding and reproducing co-speech gestures remains a vital step toward achieving truly intelligent and interactive artificial agents.

### 1.2 Theoretical Foundations of Co-Speech Gestures

Co-speech gestures, a crucial component of human communication, serve as nonverbal expressions that complement and enrich verbal information. To develop systems capable of synthesizing realistic and contextually appropriate co-speech gestures, it is essential to understand their theoretical underpinnings. These gestures are classified into four primary categories: iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and beat gestures, each playing a unique role in enhancing communication and aligning with speech in distinct ways.

Iconic gestures depict concrete objects or actions by mimicking them through bodily movements. For instance, when describing the size of an object, one might use their hands to illustrate its dimensions [5]. Iconic gestures are closely tied to the semantic content of speech, making them vital for conveying specific ideas and clarifying ambiguous statements or emphasizing certain aspects of the spoken message.

Metaphoric gestures extend beyond literal representations, symbolizing abstract concepts through symbolic motions. These gestures often accompany discussions about intangible topics such as emotions, ideas, or relationships [8]. By employing metaphoric gestures, speakers can convey complex thoughts more effectively, bridging the gap between tangible experiences and conceptual understandings. Their interpretation depends heavily on cultural contexts and shared knowledge between interlocutors.

Deictic gestures involve pointing at physical entities within the immediate environment or referencing spatial locations relative to the speaker or listener [9]. These gestures establish connections between linguistic references and external realities, facilitating grounding processes during dialogues. They direct attention towards particular items or areas, ensuring mutual understanding regarding what is being discussed and aiding in establishing spatial awareness.

Beat gestures constitute rhythmic hand movements synchronized with prosodic features of speech such as stress, pauses, and intonation patterns [10]. Unlike other types of gestures, beats do not carry explicit meanings but instead enhance rhythmical coherence between verbal utterances and accompanying motor behaviors. They contribute significantly to maintaining conversational flow, signaling important points within discourse, and expressing enthusiasm or emphasis.

The relationship between co-speech gestures and speech itself forms another critical aspect of their theoretical foundation. Gestures and speech interact dynamically throughout communication exchanges, influencing each other reciprocally. Research indicates that generating meaningful co-speech gestures requires capturing both temporal alignments—ensuring synchronization between specific moments in speech streams—and semantic correspondences—mapping relevant portions of verbal content onto corresponding gestural forms [11]. Effective integration of multimodal inputs ensures that synthesized gestures remain aligned not only temporally but also semantically with respect to associated audio signals or textual descriptions.

Furthermore, individual differences among speakers concerning personal styles, emotional states, and contextual factors affecting gesticulatory preferences highlight the complexity of this interaction [12]. Such variations necessitate flexible approaches capable of adapting across diverse populations and scenarios while preserving authenticity and naturalness in generated outputs. Personalization efforts must consider variables like age, gender, cultural background, personality traits, and situational demands when designing adaptive algorithms aimed at producing convincing co-speech gestures tailored specifically for target users.

Additionally, theoretical frameworks emphasize the importance of considering higher-level cognitive processes involved in planning and executing co-speech gestures alongside spoken productions. These include intentionality—the deliberate choice made by speakers regarding whether or not to employ gestures; modality selection—deciding which combination of sensory modalities best serves communicative goals; and sequencing strategies—organizing elements into coherent sequences that maximize clarity and impact [13].

In summary, the theoretical foundations of co-speech gestures encompass categorization schemes identifying distinct classes based on functionality, intricate interactions linking gestures with concurrent speech elements, and broader cognitive mechanisms governing overall behavior patterns. Advances in computational techniques enable increasingly sophisticated modeling efforts striving toward replicating authentic human-like performances under varied conditions [14]. Future research directions may explore novel methodologies incorporating advances from fields such as neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, and artificial intelligence to further refine our understanding of these phenomena and enhance synthetic capabilities accordingly.

### 1.3 Rule-Based Approaches to Gesture Synthesis

Rule-based approaches to gesture synthesis were among the earliest methods developed for generating co-speech gestures. These systems rely on predefined rules that map linguistic elements, such as words, phrases, or prosodic features, to specific gestures. The fundamental idea is that gestures are systematically linked to speech through well-defined relationships, which can be captured by manually crafted rules. While these approaches may lack the flexibility and expressiveness of modern data-driven methods, they provide valuable insights into the structure and semantics of co-speech gestures and serve as a foundation for understanding more advanced systems.

### Linguistic Mapping in Rule-Based Systems

The core mechanism of rule-based approaches involves mapping between linguistic elements and corresponding gestures. Iconic and metaphoric gestures, for instance, are closely tied to the semantic content of speech, as described in "Robots Learn Social Skills: End-to-End Learning of Co-Speech Gesture Generation for Humanoid Robots" [5]. These gestures are generated based on explicit mappings between the meaning conveyed by the spoken word and appropriate motion patterns. Deictic gestures, which point to objects or locations, are often directly associated with demonstrative pronouns or spatial references in the speech signal.

To implement this mapping, rule-based systems analyze the input text or audio to identify key components influencing gesture selection. Techniques such as part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and keyword extraction break down the linguistic input into smaller units. Predefined templates are then applied to generate gestures that align semantically with the accompanying speech. For example, encountering the phrase "look up" might trigger a rule specifying an upward hand movement.

### Structural Frameworks for Rule-Based Gesture Synthesis

Rule-based systems typically adopt a modular framework to facilitate effective implementation. A common approach separates the system into two main modules: a linguistic analysis module and a gesture generation module. The linguistic analysis module processes the input speech, extracting relevant features such as stress patterns, pauses, and semantic information. These features are passed to the gesture generation module, which applies predefined rules to produce corresponding gestures.

In "Augmented Co-Speech Gesture Generation: Including Form and Meaning Features to Guide Learning-Based Gesture Synthesis" [6], researchers enhance this framework by incorporating both form and meaning features. This allows the system to account not only for the literal interpretation of the speech but also for its contextual implications, leading to more contextually appropriate gestures.

### Advantages and Limitations of Rule-Based Approaches

A key advantage of rule-based approaches is their interpretability. Since the rules are explicitly defined, it is relatively straightforward to understand and debug the behavior of the system. Additionally, these systems perform well in scenarios where the relationship between speech and gestures is deterministic or highly predictable. Beat gestures, for example, can be reliably generated using simple timing rules that align gestures with syllabic stress [1].

However, rule-based approaches face significant challenges when dealing with the ambiguity and variability inherent in human communication. The same sentence or phrase can evoke different gestures depending on context, speaker, or emotional state. Traditional rule-based systems struggle to capture this complexity due to their reliance on fixed mappings rather than learning from examples. As noted in "A Comprehensive Review of Data-Driven Co-Speech Gesture Generation" [14], the diversity and idiosyncratic nature of human co-speech gestures make it difficult for rule-based methods to generalize effectively across a wide range of inputs.

Creating comprehensive and accurate rule sets also demands extensive domain expertise and manual effort. Developers must carefully analyze large datasets to identify consistent patterns and encode them into the system. Even after designing an elaborate rule set, there remains a risk of oversimplification, resulting in unnatural or overly repetitive gestures.

### Extensions and Enhancements to Rule-Based Systems

Recent studies have proposed enhancements to traditional rule-based approaches to address their limitations. In "Learning Hierarchical Cross-Modal Association for Co-Speech Gesture Generation" [15], a hierarchical framework is introduced to capture multi-granular relationships between speech and gestures. By organizing rules into multiple levels of abstraction, this approach allows for finer control over the generation process while maintaining computational efficiency.

Another notable extension integrates probabilistic reasoning into rule-based systems. Instead of strictly adhering to deterministic mappings, these enhanced systems assign probabilities to different gesture candidates. This probabilistic framework enables the system to handle uncertainty and ambiguity more gracefully, producing a broader range of plausible outputs.

Furthermore, rule-based approaches can benefit from integration with external knowledge sources, such as dictionaries, ontologies, or pre-trained language models. For example, "GesGPT: Speech Gesture Synthesis With Text Parsing from GPT" [16] demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) like GPT can be leveraged to extract rich semantic information from textual input. This extracted information guides the selection of appropriate gestures, improving the contextual relevance and expressiveness of the synthesized output.

### Transitioning Towards Data-Driven Methods

Despite their strengths, rule-based approaches ultimately face limitations in scalability and adaptability. As datasets of human gestures grow larger and more diverse, the need for flexible, data-driven solutions becomes increasingly apparent. Modern deep learning techniques, such as transformers and diffusion models, excel at capturing the intricate relationships between speech and gestures without requiring explicit rule definitions. Nevertheless, the principles underlying rule-based systems continue to inform the design of contemporary gesture synthesis architectures.

For example, the concept of modular processing pipelines, first introduced in rule-based systems, has been adapted to deep learning frameworks. Many state-of-the-art models now employ multi-stage architectures that separately handle linguistic analysis, gesture prediction, and post-processing refinement. This decomposition mirrors the functional division observed in early rule-based systems, demonstrating the lasting influence of these foundational methods.

### Conclusion

Rule-based approaches to gesture synthesis offer a clear and structured methodology for linking linguistic elements to physical movements. Although limited in scope compared to modern data-driven techniques, these systems provide valuable insights into the structural and semantic aspects of co-speech gestures. Their reliance on explicit rules ensures transparency and ease of implementation, making them suitable for applications where interpretability and precision are paramount. As research continues to evolve, the lessons learned from rule-based approaches will undoubtedly contribute to the development of even more sophisticated and adaptable gesture synthesis systems.

### 1.4 Classical Statistical Approaches to Gesture Synthesis

Classical statistical approaches to gesture synthesis represent an important bridge between rule-based systems and modern data-driven techniques. Among these methods, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) have been particularly influential due to their ability to model temporal sequences and probabilistic relationships effectively.

HMMs excel at capturing the dynamics of gestures over time by representing them as sequences of hidden states that emit observable outputs. For instance, the paper "Moving Toward High Precision Dynamical Modelling in Hidden Markov Models" emphasizes the importance of finely-tuned HMM topologies for precise temporal modeling [17]. While classical left-to-right HMMs have been prevalent, more complex structures can better capture intricate time dependencies, enhancing performance in both speech recognition and gesture synthesis. Similarly, "Fast Gesture Recognition with Multiple Stream Discrete HMMs on 3D Skeletons" demonstrates the robustness of discrete HMMs in recognizing gestures using 3D skeleton joint data through a double-stage classification approach [18]. Although this work focuses on recognition, its principles highlight the potential of HMMs in generating natural and fluid motions.

GMMs, on the other hand, are adept at modeling continuous probability distributions and are often combined with HMMs to represent emission probabilities. A notable example is found in "Variational Learning in Mixed-State Dynamic Graphical Models," where a hybrid model combines an HMM with a linear dynamic system driven by GMMs [19]. This combination enables the modeling of both discrete and continuous causes of trajectories, such as human gestures, while variational inference techniques address computational challenges. Additionally, "Detection of bimanual gestures everywhere - why it matters, what we need and what is missing" showcases the effectiveness of GMMs alongside Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) for unconstrained gesture detection, achieving high accuracy in classifying daily activities [20].

Despite their strengths, classical statistical approaches face significant limitations compared to modern data-driven methods. One key challenge is their inability to handle the one-to-many mapping problem inherent in gesture synthesis, where multiple plausible gestures may correspond to a single utterance [21]. Unlike deterministic models, modern generative models such as diffusion models can learn complex multimodal distributions and generate diverse outputs given the same input [22]. Furthermore, classical methods rely heavily on manually engineered features, increasing implementation complexity and reducing adaptability to new domains or variations in input data. In contrast, deep learning models automatically learn hierarchical representations from raw data, improving scalability and performance.

Another limitation lies in the difficulty of scaling classical approaches to large datasets. As noted in "The Impact of Quantity of Training Data on Recognition of Eating Gestures," the complexity of HMMs grows with the size of the training data, necessitating more sophisticated structures to maintain performance [23]. Moreover, the lack of end-to-end training capabilities in HMMs and GMMs results in suboptimal overall performance, as each component must be optimized separately.

While newer methods dominate cutting-edge applications, classical statistical techniques remain valuable as benchmarks and integral components within larger systems. For example, "Scalable Hybrid HMM with Gaussian Process Emission for Sequential Time-series Data Clustering" proposes a scalable HMM-Gaussian Process (GP) hybrid model capable of handling long sequences and large volumes of data efficiently [24]. Such innovations demonstrate the ongoing relevance of classical methods when enhanced with contemporary techniques.

In summary, classical statistical approaches like HMMs and GMMs laid critical groundwork for gesture synthesis research. Their interpretability, simplicity, and robustness continue to make them useful tools. However, they also exhibit limitations in addressing ambiguities, adapting to diverse inputs, and scaling effectively. These constraints drive the adoption of modern data-driven methods while underscoring the enduring value of understanding classical techniques in the broader context of gesture synthesis evolution.

## 2 Techniques and Architectures for Co-Speech Gesture Generation

### 2.1 Deep Learning Architectures for Co-Speech Gesture Generation

Deep learning architectures have become central to the advancement of co-speech gesture generation, with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and diffusion models emerging as key tools. Each architecture brings unique capabilities but also faces specific challenges that researchers continue to address.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were among the first deep learning models applied to this domain, excelling at capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data. This makes them well-suited for modeling the dynamics between speech and gestures over time. However, traditional RNNs struggle with vanishing gradients when handling long sequences [25]. Innovations like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) mitigated this issue by enabling retention of information across longer time steps. Despite these improvements, RNN-based models often require extensive tuning and lack parallelization efficiency compared to newer architectures such as transformers.

Transformers have significantly enhanced co-speech gesture generation through their self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on important parts of the input sequence. This capability is critical for aligning gestures with the semantic content of speech, as demonstrated by transformer-based models that generate semantically coherent gestures by emphasizing specific words or phrases [8]. Enhanced techniques, such as cross-local attention mechanisms, further improve synchronization between speech rhythms and gestures [26]. While highly effective, transformers demand substantial computational resources, particularly for large-scale datasets, and may underperform without adequate pretraining.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) introduce an adversarial training process involving a generator and discriminator, encouraging the creation of high-quality, realistic gestures. For example, AQ-GT employs this approach to produce expressive and synchronized gestures [27]. However, GANs are notoriously difficult to train stably, necessitating careful hyperparameter tuning and advanced techniques like Wasserstein distance or spectral normalization to ensure convergence.

Diffusion models represent a promising new class of generative models in co-speech gesture generation. By iteratively denoising corrupted signals, they reconstruct target gesture sequences while effectively handling complex multimodal interactions. This flexibility enables the generation of diverse and personalized gestures. Studies highlight their ability to incorporate speaker identity and emotional nuances, as seen in ConvoFusion's use of diffusion models for controllable gesture synthesis [7] and another study leveraging WavLM for high-fidelity gesture generation conditioned on raw speech audio [12]. Nevertheless, diffusion models are computationally intensive, requiring efficient sampling strategies to achieve real-time performance.

The integration of multimodal inputs enhances expressiveness and contextual relevance, as models leveraging both acoustic and semantic features provide richer representations than those relying solely on text or audio. For instance, Gesticulator combines these features to produce beat and semantic gestures simultaneously [8], while LivelySpeaker decouples gesture generation into script-based semantics and audio-guided rhythm refinement [28].

Despite advancements, challenges persist in ensuring stable training, maintaining temporal coherence, and achieving high diversity in generated gestures. Techniques such as latent diffusion modeling, style transfer, and reinforcement learning aim to address these issues. Examples include C2G2's two-stage temporal dependency enhancement strategy for flexible editing [29] and Mix-StAGE's adversarial training schemes for preserving individual characteristics across speakers [30].

In summary, deep learning architectures—RNNs, transformers, GANs, and diffusion models—have profoundly influenced co-speech gesture generation. While each architecture offers distinct advantages, overcoming their respective limitations remains crucial for developing more robust and versatile systems. Future work may emphasize improving computational efficiency, enhancing intermodal alignment, and expanding applicability across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

### 2.2 Input Modalities and Their Influence

The design of co-speech gesture generation systems heavily relies on the choice of input modalities, which can include audio, text, non-linguistic inputs, or combinations thereof. Each modality brings its own advantages and challenges, influencing how effectively gestures can be generated and synchronized with speech.

Audio-based systems typically use raw speech signals as input to generate co-speech gestures. These approaches focus on extracting rhythmic and prosodic information from the audio, which is crucial for generating beat gestures that align with speech rhythms. For example, "Rhythmic Gesticulator" introduces a rhythm-aware segmentation pipeline to ensure temporal coherence between vocalizations and gestures, emphasizing the importance of audio in capturing rhythmic cues [10]. Similarly, "Speech Drives Templates" employs lip-sync error as a proxy metric to tune and evaluate the synchronization ability of their model, demonstrating the effectiveness of audio-driven methods in achieving fine-grained alignment [31].

Text-based systems, in contrast, leverage linguistic information extracted from transcriptions of speech. This enables them to focus on semantic content, allowing for the generation of more contextually relevant gestures such as iconic, metaphoric, and deictic gestures. For instance, "LivelySpeaker" decouples the task into two stages: script-based gesture generation and audio-guided rhythm refinement. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP text embeddings, it ensures high semantic alignment while maintaining rhythmic synchronization through an audio-conditioned diffusion model [28]. Another example is "Gesticulator," which combines both acoustic and semantic representations of speech to produce arbitrary beat and semantic gestures, highlighting the synergy between audio and text inputs [8].

Non-linguistic inputs extend beyond traditional audio and text to include factors like speaker identity, emotion, and contextual information. These additional dimensions enrich the gestural output by enabling personalization and adaptability. For example, "Speech Gesture Generation from the Trimodal Context of Text, Audio, and Speaker Identity" incorporates speaker identity as part of the multimodal context, enabling the generation of different gesture styles for the same speech content based on specified speaker characteristics [25]. Similarly, "EMoG  Synthesizing Emotive Co-speech 3D Gesture with Diffusion Model" integrates emotion clues to guide the generation process, addressing the one-to-many mapping challenge inherent in co-speech gesture synthesis [32].

Multimodal fusion techniques combine multiple input modalities to enhance the quality and diversity of generated gestures. Such techniques often involve concatenation, attention mechanisms, or cross-modal transformers to integrate information across modalities effectively. "ConvoFusion" proposes a diffusion-based approach for multi-modal gesture synthesis, introducing guidance objectives that allow users to modulate the impact of different conditioning modalities (e.g., audio vs. text) and emphasize specific words during gesturing [7]. Another notable work is "MPE4G," which uses a multimodal pre-trained encoder trained with self-supervised learning to handle missing or noisy input modalities robustly [33].

Comparing the effectiveness of these input types reveals distinct trade-offs. Audio-based systems excel at rhythmic alignment but may struggle with semantic coherence unless augmented with additional linguistic features. Text-based systems prioritize semantic relevance but might lack precise temporal alignment without complementary audio processing. Non-linguistic inputs add richness and personalization but require careful integration to avoid overcomplicating the model architecture. Multimodal fusion addresses many of these limitations by leveraging strengths across modalities, though this comes at the cost of increased complexity and computational demands.

In conclusion, the selection of input modalities significantly influences the capabilities and performance of co-speech gesture generation systems. While each modality offers unique advantages, combining them through advanced multimodal fusion techniques holds great promise for producing realistic, contextually appropriate, and personalized gestures. Future research should continue exploring innovative ways to integrate diverse input sources, ensuring that co-speech gesture generation remains adaptable to a wide range of applications and user needs.

### 2.3 Multimodal Fusion Techniques

Multimodal fusion techniques are instrumental in advancing co-speech gesture generation by effectively integrating multiple modalities, such as audio, text, and visual data. These techniques enhance the synchronization and contextual relevance of generated gestures, addressing the limitations associated with single-modality approaches. By employing strategies such as concatenation, attention mechanisms, and cross-modal transformers, multimodal fusion enables models to produce more realistic and meaningful gestures.

Concatenation serves as a straightforward yet effective method for fusing modalities. It involves combining features from different modalities into a single vector, which is then used as input for gesture generation. For example, the "Gesticulator: A framework for semantically-aware speech-driven gesture generation" paper [8] concatenates acoustic and semantic representations of speech to generate both beat and semantic gestures simultaneously. This approach ensures that all relevant information from the input modalities is preserved, enhancing the overall quality of synthesized gestures.

Attention mechanisms play a critical role in capturing complex interactions between modalities, improving both temporal coherence and semantic alignment. In "Rhythmic Gesticulator: Rhythm-Aware Co-Speech Gesture Synthesis with Hierarchical Neural Embeddings" [10], the authors introduce a mechanism that uses attention to align hierarchical embeddings of speech and motion, ensuring rhythm- and semantics-aware gesture synthesis. Similarly, the "Learning Hierarchical Cross-Modal Association for Co-Speech Gesture Generation" [15] employs contrastive learning based on audio-text alignment to refine the quality of generated gestures. Through attention mechanisms, models can focus on the most relevant parts of the input, thereby enhancing alignment between gestures and speech.

Cross-modal transformers represent an advanced approach to multimodal fusion, leveraging self-attention and cross-attention to capture intricate relationships across modalities. These transformers allow models to jointly learn representations from multiple modalities, improving gesture generation performance. The "UnifiedGesture: A Unified Gesture Synthesis Model for Multiple Skeletons" [34] demonstrates this through the use of cross-local attention and self-attention in a diffusion model architecture, enabling the generation of realistic and speech-matched gestures. Another example is the "Diffusion-Based Co-Speech Gesture Generation Using Joint Text and Audio Representation" [35], where a contrastive speech and motion pretraining (CSMP) module learns joint embeddings for speech and gesture, facilitating semantically-aware co-speech gesture generation.

In addition to improving synchronization and alignment, multimodal fusion enhances the contextual relevance of gestures by incorporating factors such as speaker identity, emotion, and interlocutor dynamics. For instance, "Speech Gesture Generation from the Trimodal Context of Text, Audio, and Speaker Identity" [25] integrates multimodal context to reliably generate human-like gestures that match speech content and rhythm while adapting to specific speakers. Similarly, "EmotionGesture: Audio-Driven Diverse Emotional Co-Speech 3D Gesture Generation" [36] proposes an Emotion-Beat Mining module to extract emotion and audio beat features, enabling the synthesis of vivid and diverse emotional gestures.

The effectiveness of multimodal fusion is further exemplified in practical applications. "ConvoFusion: Multi-Modal Conversational Diffusion for Co-Speech Gesture Synthesis" [7] introduces a diffusion-based approach that not only generates gestures based on multi-modal inputs but also provides controllability over the impact of different conditioning modalities. This makes it adaptable for both monologue and conversational settings. Additionally, "MPE4G: Multimodal Pretrained Encoder for Co-Speech Gesture Generation" [33] leverages a multimodal pre-trained encoder trained with self-supervised learning to handle noisy or incomplete input modalities robustly, ensuring realistic co-speech gestures even under challenging conditions.

In summary, multimodal fusion techniques significantly advance co-speech gesture generation by improving synchronization, contextual relevance, and expressiveness. Strategies such as concatenation, attention mechanisms, and cross-modal transformers enable models to integrate information from multiple modalities effectively, resulting in more natural and meaningful gestures. As research progresses, these techniques will continue to address existing challenges and drive future innovations in the field.

### 2.4 Dataset Characteristics and Contributions

The development of co-speech gesture generation heavily relies on the quality and characteristics of datasets, which serve as the foundation for training models, evaluating performance, and uncovering the intricacies of human gestures in communication. Key attributes such as size, diversity, motion quality, and collection methods significantly influence model robustness and generalizability.

Dataset size is a critical factor; larger datasets enable models to learn more complex patterns, reducing overfitting and enhancing generalization capabilities. For example, the BEAT dataset spans 76 hours of high-quality multimodal data from 30 speakers across four languages and eight emotions [1]. This extensive collection supports comprehensive analysis of how conversational gestures interact with facial expressions, audio, and text. Similarly, UnifiedGesture leverages multiple datasets with varying skeletons, addressing issues of limited data and improving generalizability through a retargeting network [34].

Diversity within datasets ensures that models can handle a broad spectrum of scenarios and variations in human behavior. Datasets capturing gestures from multiple speakers, languages, and contexts enhance adaptability. The BEAT dataset exemplifies this by including speakers with diverse linguistic and emotional backgrounds, enabling studies on cross-cultural differences in gesticulation [1]. Furthermore, the Chain of Generation paper highlights the importance of multimodal priors derived from speech emotions and rhythm cues in generating realistic gestures [37].

Motion quality refers to the precision and detail captured in gestures, directly impacting the realism of synthesized outputs. High-quality datasets ensure smooth transitions and naturalistic movements. In Diverse 3D Hand Gesture Prediction from Body Dynamics by Bilateral Hand Disentanglement, the authors emphasize fine-grained motion capture using spatial-residual memory and temporal-motion memory modules, aiming to produce both natural and diverse gestures [38].

Collection methods vary among datasets, influencing their scope and applicability. Some datasets rely on controlled laboratory settings, ensuring consistency but limiting ecological validity. Others employ naturalistic settings to capture authentic behaviors. MambaTalk, for instance, uses multimodal integration under varied conditions to enhance gesture diversity and rhythm, bridging the gap between artificial lab environments and real-world applications [39].

The choice of sensors and equipment during data collection also defines dataset characteristics. Motion capture systems, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and wearable devices contribute unique features. The Activity Detection from Wearable Electromyogram Sensors using Hidden Markov Model demonstrates the utility of sEMG signals for activity detection, offering an alternative to optical-based systems [40].

Rich annotations further enrich datasets, enabling deeper exploration of relationships between speech and gestures. The BEAT dataset includes frame-level emotion and semantic relevance annotations, facilitating nuanced analyses [1]. Standard evaluation metrics, such as Fréchet Gesture Distance, help assess fidelity and originality in generated gestures [41].

Despite progress, challenges persist regarding annotation accuracy and consistency. Misaligned labels or incomplete annotations may hinder learning outcomes, necessitating preprocessing and curation efforts. Leveraging Speech for Gesture Detection in Multimodal Communication discusses strategies like extended speech time windows and Transformer encoders to address temporal misalignments [9].

Ethical considerations are equally vital when constructing datasets. Ensuring privacy protection, obtaining informed consent, and maintaining inclusivity are essential practices. The Learning Individual Styles of Conversational Gesture project releases a large video dataset of person-specific gestures while adhering to ethical standards [3].

In summary, dataset characteristics—size, diversity, motion quality, and collection methods—are instrumental in advancing co-speech gesture generation research. Ongoing improvements in these areas will continue to drive innovation toward creating realistic, context-aware, and personalized synthetic gestures, aligning well with advancements in multimodal fusion and transformer-based models discussed in previous and following sections.

### 2.5 Transformer-Based Models for Gesture Synthesis

Transformer-based models have emerged as a cornerstone in co-speech gesture synthesis, excelling at capturing the intricate temporal dependencies and semantic alignments between speech and gestures. These models employ self-attention and cross-local attention mechanisms to model complex relationships across modalities, producing outputs that are more natural and temporally synchronized [34]. This subsection explores the design principles, advantages, limitations, and recent advancements of transformer-based architectures in co-speech gesture generation.

Self-attention is central to transformers, allowing them to weigh the importance of different parts of an input sequence relative to one another. In co-speech gesture synthesis, this capability is essential for capturing both immediate and long-term dependencies within speech and gesture sequences. For example, when generating beat gestures corresponding to emphasized words, transformers can consider not just the local audio segment but also its broader context within the utterance [8]. This holistic approach contrasts with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which process information sequentially and may struggle with longer contexts.

Cross-local attention mechanisms further enhance the precision of alignment between speech and gesture features. By focusing on local regions of the input while retaining global awareness, these mechanisms ensure that subtle nuances in speech translate into appropriate gestural expressions. For instance, cross-local attention enables iconic gestures to align closely with specific keywords or phrases [35], fostering coherence and contextual relevance in synthesized outputs.

Recent studies highlight the effectiveness of transformers in addressing key challenges of co-speech gesture synthesis. The Joint Correlation-aware transFormer (JCFormer) proposed in EMoG exemplifies how specialized modules within transformer architectures can model joint correlations and temporal dynamics, resulting in more realistic and expressive gestures [32]. Additionally, integrating emotional cues into transformers enhances their ability to produce diverse and nuanced gestures that reflect the speaker's affective state [32]. For example, an excited tone might yield exaggerated gestures, whereas a calm tone would lead to subtler motions.

Transformers have also been successfully combined with other advanced techniques, such as diffusion models, to improve gesture quality and diversity. A notable example is the Diffusion Audio-Gesture Transformer, which leverages the strengths of both paradigms to better attend to multimodal information and model long-term temporal dependencies [42]. This integration underscores the versatility of transformers in enhancing generative capabilities.

Despite their successes, transformer-based models face challenges, particularly regarding computational efficiency. Training and deploying transformers often demand significant resources, especially for long sequences. Researchers have addressed this limitation through strategies like pruning unnecessary connections and adopting lightweight alternatives to standard attention mechanisms [43]. Moreover, handling the one-to-many mapping problem remains a challenge, though latent variable modeling and conditional generation approaches show promise [43].

In summary, transformer-based models offer transformative capabilities in co-speech gesture synthesis by effectively capturing temporal dependencies and semantic alignments. Their design innovations, combined with complementary techniques, continue to push the boundaries of realistic and expressive gesture generation. Future research will focus on mitigating existing limitations and expanding their applicability for even more sophisticated systems. This progression aligns seamlessly with advances in datasets and generative frameworks discussed in preceding and following sections.

### 2.6 GANs and Diffusion Models in Gesture Generation

GANs and diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools in the generation of realistic and diverse co-speech gestures, addressing key challenges such as one-to-many mappings and enhancing expressivity. By modeling complex distributions over data, these advanced generative models provide nuanced control over synthesized outputs that surpass traditional methods.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) excel at producing high-quality, realistic motions by leveraging their adversarial training mechanism [33]. In co-speech gesture synthesis, GANs generate gestures conditioned on speech features, ensuring precise alignment with input signals. AQ-GT exemplifies this approach by combining GANs with quantization techniques to learn latent space representations rather than direct input-output mappings [27], thereby improving gesture quality and mitigating artifacts common in simpler models.

Diffusion models, another class of state-of-the-art generative algorithms, demonstrate exceptional performance in generating detailed and varied co-speech gestures. Unlike GANs, which rely on adversarial training, diffusion models progressively add noise to data and reverse this process during inference [7]. This probabilistic framework makes diffusion models particularly suited for handling one-to-many mappings—a critical challenge where multiple valid gestures may correspond to a single speech segment. ConvoFusion, for instance, employs a diffusion-based framework to produce semantically aligned gestures while allowing users to modulate guidance from different modalities such as audio or text, thus increasing controllability [7].

Both GANs and diffusion models significantly enhance gesture expressivity, contributing to the perceived naturalness of virtual agents or robots. Expressivity encompasses the richness and variability of gestures, which can be tailored using multimodal contexts like speaker identity or acoustic properties of speech. For example, Speech Gesture Generation from the Trimodal Context of Text, Audio, and Speaker Identity integrates these factors into its architecture, resulting in human-like and expressive outputs adapted to individual speakers [25]. Similarly, diffmotion-v2 leverages WavLM pre-trained models and adaptive layer normalization within transformer layers to capture intricate relationships between speech and gestures [12], enabling the synthesis of full-body, stylistically rich gestures.

Addressing one-to-many mappings remains crucial for achieving realistic results in co-speech gesture generation. Traditional deterministic methods often fail to represent the range of plausible outputs for ambiguous inputs. Probabilistic frameworks, such as those employed in diffusion models, offer effective solutions by modeling the underlying distribution of possible gestures given specific conditions. Unified speech and gesture synthesis using flow matching demonstrates how optimal transport theory can be applied through conditional flow matching to jointly synthesize speech acoustics and skeleton-based 3D gesture motions [44], ensuring consistency between verbal and non-verbal communication modes.

Recent advancements emphasize the integration of multiple modalities for enhanced realism. Integrated Speech and Gesture Synthesis showcases the superiority of unified models compared to separate pipelines [45]. Rhythmic Gesticulator highlights the importance of rhythm-aware mechanisms embedded within neural embeddings for improving temporal coherence between vocalizations and corresponding gestures [10]. These innovations underscore the growing sophistication of machine learning techniques designed specifically for co-speech gesture applications.

Ongoing research continues to refine existing methodologies, exploring innovative approaches like leveraging large language models (LLMs) for improved semantic parsing [16] or emphasizing semantic awareness alongside rhythmic refinement capabilities [28]. Each contribution enhances our understanding of effective strategies for overcoming persistent obstacles in co-speech gesture generation tasks.

In summary, GANs and diffusion models are pivotal in modern efforts to create lifelike co-speech gestures across various domains, including entertainment and human-robot interaction. Their unique strengths make them indispensable tools for tackling challenges related to ambiguity resolution, diversity promotion, synchronization maintenance, and overall enhancement of expressive qualities in synthesized outputs. This aligns well with the focus on temporal dynamics and synchronization explored in subsequent sections.

### 2.7 Temporal Dynamics and Synchronization

Modeling temporal dynamics and ensuring synchronization between speech and gestures are fundamental challenges in co-speech gesture generation. This section examines approaches such as autoregressive models, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), and time-aware techniques that address these complexities.

Autoregressive models excel at capturing temporal dependencies by predicting future states conditioned on past observations [7]. They process sequential data incrementally, making them well-suited for generating synchronized gestures frame-by-frame. By maintaining consistent motion flow, these models ensure smooth transitions in generated outputs. However, their sequential nature imposes computational demands, potentially limiting real-time applicability.

DDPMs introduce a novel paradigm for modeling temporal dynamics in co-speech gestures [7]. These models progressively add noise to the data and learn to reverse this process iteratively. In co-speech gesture synthesis, DDPMs capture long-term dependencies between speech and gestures, producing naturalistic motions aligned with input signals. For instance, ConvoFusion integrates guidance objectives into its diffusion framework, enabling users to modulate the influence of conditioning modalities (e.g., audio vs. text) and emphasize specific words during gesturing.

Misalignments between speech and gestures due to variations in sampling rates across modalities pose additional challenges [9]. Researchers have mitigated this issue using Transformer encoders with cross-modal and early fusion strategies. These methods effectively align and integrate auditory and visual information, improving gesture detection accuracy. Expanding the speech buffer beyond visual time segments enriches contextual information, while leveraging low-level speech frequency features enhances synchronization.

Time-aware techniques further enhance temporal dynamics and synchronization through innovative architectures. Hierarchical designs preserve long-range dependencies within and across modalities [46], addressing limitations of recurrent networks. Delta-attention mechanisms focus on local differences per modality, capturing individual idiosyncrasies more effectively. Cross-attention fusion techniques combine locally nuanced details with broader contextual insights, augmenting global views of expressed emotions.

Studies confirm that multimodal integration using cross-modal and early fusion strategies outperforms unimodal or late fusion approaches [9]. The correlation between models' gesture prediction confidence levels and underlying speech feature properties highlights the importance of fine-grained temporal alignment.

Emerging methodologies, such as state space models (SSMs), offer alternative solutions for enhancing gesture synthesis quality through multimodal integration [39]. SSMs enable two-stage modeling involving discrete motion priors, boosting diversity and rhythm in generated sequences. Despite being computationally efficient compared to transformers and diffusion models, SSM-based approaches achieve competitive results.

In summary, ensuring proper temporal dynamics and synchronization in co-speech gesture generation requires integrating advanced modeling techniques. Autoregressive models provide robust mechanisms for sequential data processing, while DDPMs flexibly model complex interactions between speech and gestures. Time-aware techniques refine these processes by addressing misalignment issues and promoting deeper understanding of cross-modal relationships. Continued advancements in architecture design and optimization will drive the development of increasingly sophisticated systems capable of producing realistic, contextually appropriate gestures.

### 2.8 Controllable and Personalized Gesture Generation

Controllable and personalized gesture generation is a vital aspect of advancing co-speech gesture synthesis. Tailoring gestures to fit specific speakers or contexts enhances the realism and naturalness of synthesized motions, bridging the gap between model-generated outputs and human-like interactions. Recent studies have focused on integrating techniques such as style conditioning, speaker identity encoding, reinforcement learning-based refinements, and user-guided gesture editing to achieve this level of customization [34; 26].

Style conditioning has become a pivotal technique in aligning generated gestures with a desired aesthetic. By introducing latent variables or conditioning factors into generative models, researchers enable control over stylistic attributes, leading to diverse and expressive outputs. In "DiffuseStyleGesture," classifier-free guidance within diffusion models allows for interpolation or extrapolation of gesture styles [26]. This approach not only increases diversity but also refines expressivity and aesthetic qualities of the generated motions, utilizing initial gestures and noise levels to further enrich output variability.

Speaker identity encoding ensures that generated gestures reflect the unique characteristics of individual speakers. For applications such as virtual avatars or social robots, maintaining consistency with a speaker's mannerisms is crucial. The study "Speech Gesture Generation from the Trimodal Context of Text, Audio, and Speaker Identity" demonstrates this by incorporating adversarial training schemes alongside text, audio, and speaker information [25]. This multimodal context-aware model generates distinct gesture styles while preserving speaker individuality across various scenarios.

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers additional enhancements in controllability by refining gesture sequences iteratively according to specific criteria. In "UnifiedGesture," RL optimizes discrete gesture units using a learned reward function [34], addressing challenges like temporal alignment and improving overall motion quality. These methods allow fine-tuning based on user preferences or contextual requirements without requiring extensive retraining of the underlying models.

User-guided gesture editing empowers end-users with greater control over gesture production. Techniques leveraging invertible properties of certain generative models, such as those in "A Unified Editing Method for Co-Speech Gesture Generation via Diffusion Inversion," enable reconstruction of intermediate states during denoising stages [47]. Subsequent optimizations applied to these reconstructed representations allow adjustments at both high-level aspects (e.g., style preservation) and low-level details (e.g., joint rotations or velocities), offering interactive refinement capabilities.

Cross-modal transformer architectures enhance interaction management among multiple input modalities through tailored attention mechanisms. These designs capture spatial relationships within single frames and temporal dynamics throughout sequences. As seen in "ConvoFusion Multi-Modal Conversational Diffusion for Co-Speech Gesture Synthesis," multi-modal inputs including audio and text guide the generation process toward coherent, semantically aligned results [7].

In summary, progress in controllable and personalized gesture generation continues to expand the capabilities of conversational agents and interactive systems. Innovations in style conditioning, speaker identity encoding, reinforcement learning-based refinements, and user-guided editing pave the way for increasingly sophisticated digital interactions. Future research may explore integrating additional sources of information, such as emotional cues from raw audio streams, further broadening the applicability of these technologies.

### 2.9 Real-Time and Long-Sequence Gesture Generation

Real-time and long-sequence gesture generation introduces distinct challenges in co-speech gesture synthesis. While significant progress has been made in generating short sequences, maintaining high-quality gestures over extended durations while ensuring real-time performance remains an open research area. The primary challenges involve preserving temporal coherence, optimizing computational efficiency, and sustaining synchronization with speech.

A key obstacle in real-time gesture generation is managing uni-directional information flow effectively. Traditional autoregressive models process inputs sequentially, leading to delays that compromise real-time capabilities. Non-autoregressive approaches have emerged as a solution by enabling parallel sequence generation, thereby reducing latency [42]. For example, diffusion models adapted for real-time applications optimize sampling strategies—such as employing fewer denoising steps or leveraging classifier-free guidance—to strike a balance between quality and speed [42].

Another effective strategy involves outpainting-based sampling, which generates gesture sequences incrementally while maintaining consistency with previously generated frames. This incremental approach focuses computational resources on shorter time windows, improving efficiency without sacrificing global coherence [7]. By integrating multi-modal inputs like text and audio, these methods enhance semantic alignment and enrich the expressiveness of the generated gestures.

Efficient computation is critical for real-time gesture generation. Although diffusion models excel at producing high-quality outputs, their iterative denoising processes demand substantial computational resources. To address this, recent innovations explore architectural improvements and algorithmic refinements. Lightweight architectures with reduced parameters are introduced to preserve performance while minimizing overhead [10]. Additionally, annealed noise sampling strategies stabilize training and accelerate inference [42].

Multimodal fusion techniques also play a pivotal role in enhancing real-time capabilities. Combining linguistic and acoustic features offers richer context for gesture synthesis, ensuring better alignment with speech rhythms and semantics. Cross-local attention mechanisms within transformer architectures exemplify this approach, fostering fine-grained interactions between modalities [26]. Such mechanisms help maintain synchronization between speech and gestures even during lengthy sequences.

The characteristics of datasets significantly impact the feasibility of real-time and long-sequence gesture generation. Diverse, high-quality motion data enable models to generalize effectively across various contexts and styles. Notable contributions from datasets like Trinity, ZEGGS, and BEAT have advanced the state of the art in gesture synthesis [12]. However, ensuring dataset diversity and quality continues to be a challenge when scaling models for complex interactions or multiple speakers.

Advancements in generative models further contribute to overcoming limitations in real-time gesture generation. Pre-training on large-scale audio representations, such as those provided by WavLM, enhances the model's sensitivity to speech nuances, improving gesture mapping accuracy [12]. Reinforcement learning integrated into diffusion pipelines allows fine-tuning of gesture dynamics based on criteria like style or emotion [34].

Despite these strides, persistent challenges include drift and desynchronization. Drift occurs when small errors accumulate over time, causing gestures to deviate from intended trajectories. Desynchronization happens when the timing between speech and gestures becomes misaligned, affecting naturalness. Recurrent constraints or explicit rhythm modeling offer solutions to mitigate these issues [10].

Personalization adds another layer of complexity. Adapting gestures to individual preferences or cultural norms requires flexible frameworks capable of incorporating dynamic user feedback. Approaches involving prompt engineering or curated gesture libraries present promising avenues for achieving personalized outputs [16].

Lastly, ethical considerations must inform the deployment of real-time gesture generation systems. Ensuring fairness, inclusivity, and privacy protection grows increasingly vital as these technologies expand into social robotics, virtual avatars, and multimedia systems. Future work should emphasize robust evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets to objectively measure progress and guide innovation.

In summary, real-time and long-sequence gesture generation remain exciting frontiers in co-speech gesture synthesis. Continued advancements in diffusive architectures, multimodal fusion, and dataset design extend the boundaries of what is achievable. Overcoming existing challenges will necessitate interdisciplinary collaboration and sustained effort, ultimately fostering more sophisticated and engaging human-machine interactions.

## 3 Challenges in Generating Realistic and Contextualized Gestures

### 3.1 Data Quality and Annotation Limitations

The challenge of generating realistic and contextualized co-speech gestures is deeply intertwined with the quality and characteristics of the datasets used for training. One critical factor in dataset design is its size, which directly influences a model's ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Insufficiently large datasets can lead to overfitting, where models learn specific patterns in the data rather than underlying principles that apply broadly [48]. Such limitations hinder the robustness of generated gestures, making them less adaptable to novel contexts.

Moreover, dataset diversity plays a pivotal role in shaping model performance. Co-speech gestures encompass a wide variety of forms, including iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and beat gestures, each serving distinct communicative functions [14]. For instance, beat gestures provide rhythmic emphasis, while iconic gestures depict concrete objects or actions. A dataset lacking sufficient diversity risks producing gestures that fail to capture the richness and nuance inherent in human communication. Furthermore, cultural variations in gesturing add another layer of complexity, necessitating datasets that span multiple linguistic and cultural backgrounds [7].

Annotation accuracy also poses a significant hurdle. High-quality annotations are crucial for guiding models to correctly associate speech elements with appropriate gestures. However, the annotation process is often fraught with challenges. Human annotators may introduce inconsistencies due to subjective interpretations of ambiguous cases, potentially leading to noisy labels. Additionally, the alignment between speech and gestures must be meticulously annotated to ensure temporal coherence, as misaligned annotations could result in gestures that appear out of sync with spoken content [3]. This level of detail requires substantial effort and expertise, contributing to the high cost and time investment associated with creating well-annotated datasets.

Another aspect affecting data quality is the motion capture technology employed during dataset collection. Differences in hardware precision and calibration standards can introduce variations in the recorded motion data, impacting the fidelity of gestures learned by models [31]. Moreover, limitations in capturing fine-grained details such as finger movements or subtle hand postures might restrict the expressiveness of synthesized gestures. Consequently, advancements in motion capture techniques are essential to improving the overall quality of gesture datasets.

To address these challenges, researchers have adopted various strategies. For example, leveraging crowd-sourcing platforms has enabled the collection of larger and more diverse datasets at reduced costs compared to traditional methods involving professional actors or experts [5]. Still, this approach introduces its own set of issues related to participant variability and potential lack of consistency in execution style. Another promising avenue involves augmenting existing datasets through synthetic data generation, using techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or diffusion models [29]. By expanding dataset coverage artificially, models trained on augmented datasets may achieve improved generalization capabilities.

Despite these efforts, fundamental challenges persist. Ensuring fair representation across genders, age groups, and ethnicities remains an ongoing concern, as biases present in datasets could perpetuate inequitable treatment by AI systems [30]. Similarly, balancing computational efficiency with the need for high-resolution data continues to demand innovative solutions. As research progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that overcoming data-related obstacles will require interdisciplinary collaboration, integrating insights from linguistics, psychology, computer science, and beyond.

Ultimately, the interplay between dataset characteristics and model outcomes underscores the necessity for continuous improvement in data collection practices. By addressing current limitations in dataset size, quality, diversity, and annotation accuracy, researchers pave the way for more effective co-speech gesture generation systems capable of delivering natural, engaging interactions in real-world applications [49]. These improvements will not only enhance the realism of generated gestures but also better equip models to handle the one-to-many mapping challenge discussed in subsequent sections.

### 3.2 One-to-Many Mappings in Gesture Generation

The one-to-many mapping challenge represents a fundamental hurdle in co-speech gesture generation, directly impacting the ability to produce realistic and contextually appropriate gestures. Unlike modalities such as text or audio, which often have deterministic mappings to their counterparts, gestures exhibit significant variability even for identical spoken content. For example, the phrase "the ball is on the table" could evoke a pointing gesture, an iconic depiction of a ball, or a metaphorical motion signifying placement [5]. This inherent ambiguity complicates model training, leading to overly smoothed outputs that fail to capture the expressiveness and diversity of human gesticulation.

To mitigate this issue, researchers have developed several strategies aimed at encoding and leveraging the rich variability of gestures. One widely adopted approach involves the use of latent variables within generative models. By introducing stochastic components into the architecture, these models can sample multiple plausible gestures for the same input speech. The work "Co-Speech Gesture Synthesis using Discrete Gesture Token Learning" exemplifies this by proposing a two-stage model where residual codes sampled from a discrete codebook enable diverse gesture sequences conditioned on the same speech input. Similarly, "C2G2 Controllable Co-speech Gesture Generation with Latent Diffusion Model" employs a repainting strategy to flexibly edit and generate gestures through manipulation of latent representations [29].

Conditioning the generation process on auxiliary factors beyond raw speech data has also proven effective in disambiguating gesture options. Emotion serves as a powerful modality for guiding the synthesis of expressive and contextually relevant gestures. By embedding emotional cues extracted from speech or provided explicitly, systems can generate outputs that align with intended moods. The paper "EmotionGesture Audio-Driven Diverse Emotional Co-Speech 3D Gesture Generation" demonstrates this by employing an emotion-conditioned VAE to sample features and produce diverse emotional results [36]. Likewise, "EMoG Synthesizing Emotive Co-speech 3D Gesture with Diffusion Model" integrates emotion clues to address the one-to-many problem, enhancing focus and controllability [32].

Speaker identity offers another avenue for resolving ambiguities in gesture generation. Individual gestural styles are shaped by personality traits, cultural background, and communication preferences. Modeling speaker-specific characteristics enhances the realism and personalization of synthesized gestures. The work "Speech Gesture Generation from the Trimodal Context of Text, Audio, and Speaker Identity" underscores the importance of incorporating speaker identity embeddings, showing improvements in both quantitative metrics and subjective evaluations [25].

Contextual information derived from conversational dynamics or environmental cues further enriches gesture generation. Multi-participant conversations require modeling of interlocutor interactions, turn-taking patterns, and shared situational knowledge. The paper "Conversational Co-Speech Gesture Generation via Modeling Dialog Intention, Emotion, and Context with Diffusion Models" introduces CoDiffuseGesture, a diffusion model-based approach that captures dialog intention, emotion, and semantic context to produce interactive, high-quality gestures [13].

Despite these advancements, challenges persist in fully addressing the one-to-many mapping problem. Limited dataset diversity and size restrict the learning of comprehensive mappings across varied scenarios. Additionally, accurately modeling nuances such as rhythm, timing, and semantic alignment demands sophisticated architectures capable of effective multimodal fusion. Innovations in transformer-based models and diffusion probabilistic frameworks present promising solutions for capturing long-term dependencies, preserving temporal coherence, and promoting diversity in outputs.

In summary, overcoming the one-to-many mapping challenge requires integrating latent variables, conditioning on auxiliary factors like emotion and speaker identity, and leveraging advanced generative techniques. Future research should prioritize expanding dataset diversity, refining multimodal integration mechanisms, and enhancing interpretability of generated gestures. Addressing these issues will pave the way for more natural, engaging, and context-aware interactions, bridging the gap between realistic co-speech gestures and their synthetic counterparts. These efforts naturally transition into discussions on emotional expressivity and style control, where the richness of gestures continues to be explored and enhanced.

### 3.3 Emotional Expressivity and Style Control

Emotional expressivity and style control are critical aspects of generating realistic co-speech gestures, building upon the foundational challenge of one-to-many mapping discussed earlier. Beyond simply aligning gestures with speech rhythms and semantics, it is essential to convey intended emotions and stylistic nuances effectively [10]. As non-verbal cues, gestures play a pivotal role in enriching human communication by conveying subtle emotional undertones and personalizing interactions.

One significant difficulty lies in integrating emotional cues into the generation process. Emotional cues in speech can be extracted from acoustic features such as pitch, intonation, and energy levels [12]. However, translating these acoustic signals into corresponding gestures while preserving their emotional essence is complex. For instance, a higher pitch might indicate excitement or anxiety, but the same pitch variation could result in entirely different gestures depending on the context. Contextual information alongside acoustic features becomes crucial for ensuring that generated gestures align with the desired emotional tone [7].

Stylistic diversity poses another challenge in gesture generation. Human gestures vary widely across individuals due to factors like personality, cultural background, and age. Capturing this diversity requires sophisticated models capable of encoding individual styles. Conditioning the gesture generation model on speaker identity or specific style embeddings allows for personalized synthesis tailored to each speaker's unique characteristics [25]. By leveraging multimodal inputs, including text, audio, and speaker identity, these models enhance the realism and appropriateness of the generated gestures.

Cross-lingual considerations further complicate the task. Different languages have distinct prosodic patterns and pragmatic rules influencing how speakers use gestures during communication. A gesture considered appropriate in one language may appear unnatural or even offensive in another. To address this, some studies incorporate language-specific features or employ multilingual datasets for training [16], aiming to produce gestures that harmonize seamlessly with spoken content regardless of the language used.

To overcome these challenges, researchers have proposed various innovative solutions. Some works utilize large pre-trained models like WavLM or CLIP to extract richer representations of speech and text, thereby improving the expressiveness of the generated gestures [12; 50]. Others enhance controllability by introducing mechanisms such as classifier-free guidance or adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN), allowing users to manipulate attributes like gesture amplitude, speed, or overall style [26].

Reinforcement learning has also been explored to refine gesture sequences iteratively, ensuring they remain consistent with input speech both temporally and semantically [34]. Through interaction with environments modeled after real-world constraints, RL agents learn optimal policies for producing naturalistic gestures under varying conditions. Adversarial training schemes encourage diversity within outputs by competing against discriminators tasked with distinguishing between genuine and synthetic samples [5].

Despite these advancements, limitations persist. Existing datasets often lack sufficient representation across demographic dimensions, leading to biases in learned models. Evaluating emotional expressivity and style fidelity remains challenging due to the subjectivity inherent in human perception [51]. Objective metrics fail to fully capture nuanced aspects of quality, necessitating reliance on subjective assessments through user studies. Addressing these issues will require collecting more inclusive datasets, developing robust evaluation frameworks, and refining current methodologies.

In summary, generating emotionally expressive and stylistically diverse co-speech gestures presents formidable challenges requiring multidisciplinary approaches. Successful integration of emotional cues, personalization, and cross-lingual considerations holds immense potential for advancing applications ranging from virtual avatars to social robotics [21]. Future research should focus on addressing existing gaps while exploring novel paradigms capable of unlocking unprecedented levels of realism and interactivity in artificial systems. This section naturally transitions into the subsequent discussion on synchronization with speech signals, where temporal and semantic alignment further complements the richness of generated gestures.

### 3.4 Synchronization with Speech Signals

Synchronization with speech signals is a cornerstone challenge in co-speech gesture generation, bridging the gap between emotional expressivity and contextual grounding. Achieving effective synchronization ensures that gestures align both temporally and semantically with spoken words, thereby enhancing the naturalness and intelligibility of communication. This involves two key aspects: temporal coherence (matching the timing of gestures to speech) and semantic alignment (ensuring gestures reflect meaningful elements of the accompanying speech). This subsection explores the complexities of achieving such alignment and highlights the techniques used to address these challenges.

Temporal coherence focuses on aligning the onset, duration, and offset of gestures with corresponding segments of speech. For instance, beat gestures often correspond to rhythmic intervals dictated by prosodic features like stress and intonation in speech. Traditional methods, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), have been instrumental in modeling these temporal dependencies [18]. By defining probabilistic transitions between discrete states representing different phases of a gesture, HMMs enable accurate prediction of when a gesture should begin or end relative to its associated speech segment.

Modern deep learning architectures have further advanced this field. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, capture long-range dependencies in sequential data [52]. LSTMs maintain an internal memory state, encoding past speech inputs to inform the timing of subsequent gestures. Similarly, transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms to weigh the relevance of different parts of the input sequence, focusing on specific temporal windows where gestures are likely to occur [7].

Semantic alignment complements temporal coherence by ensuring that gestures reflect the content and meaning conveyed through speech. This requires understanding not only acoustic properties but also linguistic structure and contextual nuances. Multimodal fusion techniques that integrate audio, text, and visual information enhance semantic alignment. For example, incorporating textual embeddings derived from pre-trained language models guides the generation process, enabling gestures to correspond more closely to expressed ideas [3].

Addressing variability in human communication is another critical aspect of semantic alignment. Different speakers emphasize distinct elements of their speech using gestures, influenced by factors such as emotion, personality, and cultural background. Conditioning generative models on these attributes enhances expressiveness and personalization. Learning latent spaces that encapsulate speaker-specific characteristics allows users to control these dimensions during inference [21], ensuring consistency between gestures and individual speaking styles while maintaining semantic fidelity.

Despite advancements, challenges remain in achieving robust synchronization. Mismatches between modalities due to differences in sampling rates or processing delays necessitate careful cross-modal alignment strategies, such as transformer-based encoders operating independently on each modality before fusing outputs [9]. The one-to-many mapping problem, where multiple valid gestures correspond to a single utterance, can be addressed using techniques like variational autoencoders (VAEs) or generative adversarial networks (GANs), which introduce stochasticity into the generation process [22].

Evaluation plays a pivotal role in improving synchronization. While quantitative metrics like correlation coefficients or alignment errors provide objective measures, they often overlook subjective qualities such as naturalness or appropriateness. Incorporating human judgment through user studies becomes essential [53]. Emerging metrics, such as Fréchet Gesture Distance, offer promising ways to bridge the gap between objective and perceptual evaluations [41].

In summary, synchronizing co-speech gestures with speech signals integrates temporal and semantic dimensions, building upon emotional expressivity and preparing the groundwork for contextual grounding. Advances in deep learning architectures, multimodal fusion, and evaluation methodologies continue to expand possibilities in this domain. Future research must address remaining limitations to create more natural and engaging interactions.

### 3.5 Contextual Grounding of Gestures

Contextual grounding of gestures presents significant challenges in co-speech gesture generation, especially when aligning them with broader conversational or environmental contexts. To ensure natural and meaningful interactions, it is essential to address the complexities of multimodal fusion, interlocutor dynamics, and situational relevance.

Effective multimodal fusion is a primary challenge for contextual grounding, as integrating audio, text, and visual information is critical for creating semantically aligned co-speech gestures [42]. However, weak correlations between these modalities often lead to synchronization difficulties. For example, while speech provides semantic cues, it does not always specify detailed motion characteristics. Recent advancements, such as transformers and diffusion models, have shown promise in capturing cross-modal relationships more effectively [34]. By modeling long-term dependencies and temporal coherence, these approaches enhance the alignment between gestures and their corresponding speech signals.

Interlocutor dynamics add another layer of complexity to gesture grounding. In real-world communication, gestures are influenced not only by individual speech but also by social cues and the behaviors of other speakers. This necessitates adapting gestures based on listener feedback or the overall context of the dialogue. Some studies have addressed this by training models on datasets containing multiparty interactions [5], enabling them to learn how to adjust gestures according to specific conversational scenarios.

Situational relevance further complicates the task of grounding gestures, as they must align not only with spoken words but also with the environment and setting of the interaction. For instance, gestures appropriate for a formal meeting may differ significantly from those used in casual conversations. Encoding contextual information into the gesture generation process helps address this challenge. Conditioning on emotional states, speaker identity, or cultural norms enhances the appropriateness of generated gestures [32], ensuring that gestures remain both linguistically coherent and situationally suitable.

Despite progress in deep learning techniques, limitations persist in achieving robust contextual grounding. One major limitation is the lack of diverse, high-quality datasets that adequately represent multiparty interactions [14]. This limits model generalization across various contexts. Additionally, current evaluation metrics often overlook contextual relevance, focusing instead on superficial measures like pose accuracy or synchronization error [54].

To address these challenges, future research could explore richer contextual inputs, such as integrating environmental sensors or leveraging scene metadata, to enhance gesture realism [55]. Advances in attention mechanisms and transformer-based architectures may also improve the modeling of complex multimodal interactions.

In summary, grounding gestures within broader conversational and environmental contexts remains a challenging yet crucial aspect of co-speech gesture generation. Progress in multimodal fusion, interlocutor dynamics, and situational relevance will be key to overcoming existing limitations. Future work should prioritize developing comprehensive datasets, refining evaluation methodologies, and embedding rich contextual information into the generation pipeline.

### 3.6 Handling Ambiguity and Uncertainty

Handling ambiguity and uncertainty is one of the most significant challenges in co-speech gesture generation, especially when attempting to create natural interactions that account for multimodal inputs and situational contexts. The inherent variability in mapping speech to gestures arises from ambiguities present in both linguistic and non-linguistic signals. Speech can often be vague or multifaceted, leading to multiple plausible interpretations for generating appropriate gestures. Furthermore, this complexity increases due to the need for synchronization while maintaining semantic coherence [7]. To address this challenge, researchers have developed probabilistic approaches and advanced methods for modeling uncertainty in gesture synthesis.

The mapping between speech and gestures is inherently many-to-many. A single utterance may correspond to a variety of gestures depending on factors such as emotional tone, cultural background, or individual preferences. For example, text or audio inputs might not always align directly with specific movements, as gestures are influenced by implicit contextual cues, rhythm, prosody, and speaker identity [8]. Probabilistic models become essential tools for handling this uncertainty. One promising approach involves leveraging latent variables to encode potential variations in gesture styles and semantics [25].

Traditionally, probabilistic frameworks like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) were employed to capture uncertainties in early statistical approaches to gesture generation. These models enabled stochastic mappings between linguistic features and motion parameters, addressing some degree of ambiguity [14]. However, modern deep learning architectures, particularly those incorporating variational inference techniques, offer more flexible solutions. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), for instance, provide a mechanism to learn disentangled representations of speech and gesture data, enabling better control over the diversity of generated outputs [56].

In addition to VAEs, recent research has explored diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for synthesizing realistic co-speech gestures. Diffusion models introduce noise into the training process and refine it gradually during inference, exploring a broader range of possible gesture configurations. Such models effectively handle ambiguities by sampling from a probability distribution rather than adhering strictly to deterministic mappings [10]. Similarly, GANs use adversarial training to ensure synthesized gestures remain plausible within the context of their associated speech signal. By optimizing both the generator and discriminator components, GAN-based systems minimize discrepancies between real and synthetic gestures, thus reducing uncertainties in the output space [27].

Another dimension of uncertainty stems from the temporal dynamics of speech-gesture relationships. Gestures do not occur simultaneously with every spoken word; instead, they often precede or follow speech segments depending on factors such as prosodic emphasis or pragmatic considerations. This temporal misalignment complicates accurate alignment between gestures and verbal cues [9]. Several studies have proposed mechanisms for explicitly modeling time dependencies using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer-based architectures equipped with attention mechanisms [57]. These approaches enable the system to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, even if the exact correspondence remains ambiguous.

Moreover, integrating multimodal inputs—such as combining audio, text, and visual information—offers additional avenues for resolving ambiguities in gesture generation. Cross-modal attention mechanisms allow models to leverage complementary signals across different modalities, improving prediction robustness [58]. For example, augmenting acoustic features derived from raw speech audio with semantic embeddings extracted from transcribed text enhances contextual understanding [12]. Additionally, incorporating speaker-specific attributes, such as personality traits or emotional states, enhances personalization and reduces uncertainty in style conditioning [25].

Despite advances in probabilistic and multimodal approaches, evaluating and quantifying uncertainty remains an open challenge in co-speech gesture generation. Most existing metrics assess fidelity, synchronization, or semantic relevance without explicitly accounting for the inherent ambiguity in speech-to-gesture mappings [48]. Emerging methodologies, such as Fréchet Gesture Distance or rhythm-aware metrics, attempt to bridge this gap by providing finer-grained assessments of gestural realism and appropriateness [59]. Nevertheless, developing standardized benchmarks tailored specifically to evaluate uncertainty management remains a critical area for future investigation.

To summarize, handling ambiguity and uncertainty in co-speech gesture generation requires sophisticated modeling strategies capable of addressing the complexities of human communication. Probabilistic approaches, multimodal fusion techniques, and advanced neural network architectures collectively contribute to mitigating these challenges. While substantial progress has been made, continued innovation will be necessary to fully realize the potential of natural and expressive gesture synthesis.

## 4 Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks

### 4.1 Quantitative Metrics

Quantitative metrics are essential for evaluating the quality and effectiveness of co-speech gesture generation systems. These metrics assess specific aspects of generated gestures, such as synchronization with speech, motion fidelity, rhythmicity, and path length prediction accuracy, providing insights into different facets of gesture realism and alignment with accompanying speech.

A fundamental quantitative metric is synchronization error, which measures the temporal alignment between gestures and speech. In natural human communication, gestures often coincide with or slightly precede corresponding verbal content [48]. Low synchronization errors ensure that gestures align closely with the rhythm and flow of speech, enhancing perceived fluency and coherence in interactions.

Another critical aspect evaluated quantitatively is velocity and path length prediction accuracy. Path length refers to the distance traveled by key joints (e.g., wrist or elbow) during a gesture, while velocity pertains to the speed of these movements. Accurate prediction of these parameters ensures synthesized gestures mimic real human behavior effectively. Studies indicate that some gesture attributes, like path length, may be more reliably predicted from speech signals than others, such as velocity [60]. Quantifying deviations between predicted and actual values provides valuable insights into model robustness and accuracy.

Rhythmicity is another important dimension assessed via quantitative metrics. Rhythmic gestures, such as beats, emphasize particular words or phrases within an utterance. To generate rhythmic gestures accurately, models must capture subtle prosodic cues in audio inputs and translate them into appropriate kinematic responses [10]. Evaluations focus on whether generated gestures exhibit consistent periodic patterns aligned with underlying speech rhythms, contributing significantly to overall gestural expressiveness.

Motion fidelity evaluates how faithfully target motions are reproduced compared to ground truth recordings. High motion fidelity implies minimal distortion when replicating complex sequences involving multiple degrees of freedom, such as coordinating upper body articulations alongside facial expressions [4]. Evaluators typically use objective scoring systems based on joint angle comparisons between original datasets and algorithm outputs.

In addition to individual metrics, composite scores combining several dimensions into single indices provide holistic assessments of system performance. For example, Fréchet Gesture Distance, adapted from image domain analyses, measures discrepancies among continuous temporal trajectories representing human postures over time [26]. Such methods enable fair cross-system comparisons regardless of architectural variations.

Advancements in deep learning techniques continue to drive innovation in defining and computing new quantitative metrics tailored to modern applications demanding sophisticated interactional nuance [3]. Recent works propose mechanisms distinguishing stylistic differences per speaker type through personalized embeddings derived from diverse training corpora [30].

In summary, quantitative metrics play an indispensable role in benchmarking progress in automated co-speech gesture generation technologies. These metrics range from basic measurements of elementary properties like synchronization error to advanced constructs encapsulating nuanced behavioral characteristics. As computational capabilities expand and high-quality labeled datasets become more available, expect continued refinement of existing frameworks and the emergence of entirely fresh paradigms redefining what is considered possible today [3].

### 4.2 Qualitative Metrics

Qualitative evaluation of co-speech gesture generation systems focuses on subjective aspects, assessing the appropriateness, realism, and alignment with speech content. This evaluation type is crucial as it captures human perception, determining whether a system can produce natural and effective gestures in real-world applications.

User studies are a common method for qualitative evaluation, where participants rate the quality of generated gestures [5]. Participants typically view videos or animations of virtual agents or robots performing gestures based on specific speech inputs and rate them on dimensions such as naturalness, semantic alignment, and emotional expressiveness. For example, one study found that participants perceived the generated gestures as human-like and well-matched to speech content [5].

Likert-scale ratings provide a standardized approach to qualitative assessment. Evaluators use scales (e.g., 1 to 5 or 1 to 7) to rate different aspects of gestures, like realism and synchronization [31]. For instance, a study introduced gesture template vectors to generate realistic sequences and used Likert-scale ratings to evaluate their fidelity and synchronization [31]. This method enables granular assessments by capturing nuanced perceptions from evaluators.

Pairwise comparisons involve evaluators comparing gestures from different systems or conditions to determine which performs better according to specific criteria [48]. The GENEA Challenge 2020 exemplified this technique with a large crowdsourced user study comparing multiple systems, providing insights into their relative strengths and weaknesses [48].

Perceptual assessments examine how well gestures align with human expectations. These evaluations often analyze timing and amplitude to ensure coherence with speech patterns [10]. A rhythm-aware synthesis method was evaluated perceptually to confirm convincing results in both rhythm and semantics [10].

Semantic meaningfulness is another focus of qualitative evaluations. The Gesticulator framework, designed for semantically-aware gesture generation, was subjectively and objectively evaluated to confirm its success in aligning gestures with speech semantics [8]. Evaluators ensured that gestures conveyed intended meanings, enhancing communication effectiveness.

Some studies incorporate multimodal pre-trained encoders to improve robustness and generalization [33]. Through human evaluations, the MPE4G method demonstrated its ability to render realistic co-speech gestures even under noisy or missing input modalities [33].

Emotion adds complexity to qualitative evaluations. Systems generating emotive gestures must balance semantic alignment with emotional expressiveness [32]. The EMoG framework addressed this by incorporating emotion clues and proposing a JCFormer for joint correlation and temporal dynamics modeling [32], surpassing previous methods in gesture synthesis.

Interactivity and adaptability in conversational scenarios extend qualitative evaluations beyond visual inspection [13]. CoDiffuseGesture synthesizes high-quality, interactive gestures aligned with speech, demonstrating promising performance through experimental validation [13].

In conclusion, qualitative metrics are essential for evaluating co-speech gesture generation systems. By using user studies, Likert-scale ratings, pairwise comparisons, and perceptual assessments, researchers gain valuable insights into gesture effectiveness and naturalness. As advancements continue, refining these techniques will remain vital for improving co-speech gesture synthesis.

### 4.3 Benchmark Datasets

Benchmark datasets are a cornerstone of co-speech gesture generation research, providing standardized data for both training and evaluating models. These datasets vary significantly in terms of size, diversity, multimodality, and annotation quality, all of which influence the performance and generalization capabilities of gesture generation systems. Below, we explore some key datasets used in this domain, highlighting their unique contributions and limitations.

The BEAT (Benchmark for Evaluation of Audio-Driven Talking Avatars) dataset [14] stands out as one of the most widely utilized resources. It includes high-quality motion capture recordings synchronized with speech audio from TED talks, offering rich multimodal data comprising audio, text transcripts, and motion capture sequences. Its large size and high-quality annotations make it particularly suitable for both training and benchmarking purposes. However, its focus on monologues may limit its applicability to conversational gestures involving multiple speakers.

Another significant contribution is the ZEGGS (Zurich Eyes and Gestures in Speech) dataset [31]. ZEGGS captures motion data during spontaneous conversations, emphasizing how gestures naturally align with speech in interactive settings. Unlike BEAT, ZEGGS highlights conversational gestures and interactions between speakers, making it especially useful for developing conversational agents. Despite its strengths, its relatively smaller sample size compared to other datasets might constrain scalability for deep learning applications.

The Trinity Motion Capture Dataset [12] offers extensive coverage of non-verbal behaviors, including facial expressions, hand movements, and body postures synchronized with speech audio. This comprehensive dataset enables researchers to explore holistic digital avatars and speaker-specific characteristics such as personal style and emotional expressivity. However, its complexity may demand substantial computational resources for processing.

For cross-modal fusion tasks, GENEA (Generation and Evaluation of Non-verbal Behaviour for Embodied Agents) Challenge datasets have become indispensable [48]. Designed to facilitate comparisons across different gesture generation approaches, these datasets provide a unified framework for evaluation by encompassing various modalities, including audio, text, and visual cues. Their integration of crowdsourced human assessments ensures that benchmarks reflect real-world user expectations, though they may lack variability in certain contexts outside predefined scenarios.

The DnD Group Gesture dataset introduced in [7] captures over six hours of video data showing five individuals interacting, offering insights into complex social dynamics and coordinated group gestures. This richness supports advanced studies on context-awareness and interlocutor adaptation but may be less applicable for single-speaker or dyadic interaction cases.

Specialized datasets further enrich the field by focusing on specific aspects of co-speech gesture generation. For instance, the Trimodal Context dataset presented in [25] integrates textual, acoustic, and visual information about speakers, enabling investigations into trimodal influences on gesture styles. Similarly, "GestureDiffuCLIP" utilizes custom datasets enriched with contrastive language-image pre-training embeddings [50], emphasizing semantic alignment between gestures and spoken content.

Annotation quality varies across datasets, impacting their effectiveness for different analyses. High-quality annotations, as seen in datasets like BEAT, enable precise modeling of temporal relationships between speech and gestures [10]. Lower-quality annotations, however, can introduce inaccuracies in evaluations reliant on labeled ground truths. Future efforts should therefore prioritize improving annotation standards while expanding dataset sizes to enhance robustness and reliability.

In conclusion, benchmark datasets underpin co-speech gesture generation research, driving advancements through standardized resources. As these datasets continue to evolve alongside improvements in data collection methods and analytical tools, they pave the way for increasingly sophisticated models capable of addressing nuanced communication needs. This foundation directly supports the qualitative and cross-modal evaluation techniques discussed in preceding and subsequent sections, ensuring comprehensive progress in the field.

### 4.4 Cross-Modal Evaluation Techniques

Cross-modal evaluation techniques play a pivotal role in assessing the alignment and coherence between gestures and speech across different modalities. These evaluations emphasize three key aspects: semantic relevance, emotional congruence, and temporal coherence, all of which ensure that generated co-speech gestures are contextually appropriate, emotionally aligned, and temporally synchronized with accompanying speech.

Semantic relevance examines whether gestures align with the meaning conveyed by the speech input. For example, iconic gestures should visually depict objects or actions mentioned in the speech [53]. This requires models to capture the nuanced relationships between linguistic elements and their corresponding physical manifestations. Studies have shown that integrating multiple modalities, such as text, audio, and facial expressions, can significantly enhance semantic alignment [7]. To quantitatively assess this alignment, metrics like Semantic Relevance Gesture Recall (SRGR) provide an objective measure of how well gestures correspond to the intended semantics of spoken content.

Emotional congruence evaluates the extent to which gestures reflect the emotional tone of the speech. Emotions influence both the style and intensity of gestures, making it crucial for gesture synthesis systems to effectively incorporate emotional cues. A comprehensive review underscores the importance of generating gestures that match not only the verbal message but also the intended emotional state [14]. Some approaches use emotional embeddings derived from the speech signal or textual representation to condition the generation process [52], ensuring that gestures resonate with the appropriate emotional context and enhance naturalness.

Temporal coherence ensures gestures are appropriately timed relative to speech, maintaining synchronization throughout interactions. Misalignment disrupts communication fluidity and diminishes gesture effectiveness. Achieving temporal coherence is challenging due to the one-to-many mapping problem, where multiple valid gesture sequences may correspond to a single speech segment [22]. Techniques such as autoregressive modeling and denoising diffusion probabilistic models address this by learning parameterized Markov chains to generate temporally coherent gestures [22]. Cross-local attention mechanisms further improve temporal alignment by capturing long-range dependencies between speech and gestures [34].

Multimodal integration significantly advances cross-modal evaluation techniques. Systems fusing information from audio, text, and visual data are better equipped to produce semantically relevant, emotionally congruent, and temporally coherent gestures [39]. Fusion strategies include concatenation, attention mechanisms, and cross-modal transformers, each enhancing contextual understanding and realism [61]. Transformer-based architectures leverage self-attention and cross-local attention to model intricate modality interactions, improving output quality.

Beyond subjective assessments, robust quantitative methods are increasingly emphasized. Metrics like Fréchet Gesture Distance adapt established measures to evaluate gesture fidelity and originality [41], providing insights into generative model performance. Rhythm-aware metrics specifically designed for co-speech gestures offer fine-grained evaluations of temporal dynamics, ensuring natural rhythms and cadences [9].

Despite progress, challenges persist due to human behavioral variability, ambiguities in speech-to-gesture mappings, and dataset limitations [23]. Future research could explore enhanced multimodal integration, refined evaluation metrics, and larger datasets to overcome these obstacles, driving the field toward greater realism in co-speech gesture synthesis. This focus aligns closely with the evolving standards set by benchmark datasets and complements the qualitative and objective evaluations discussed in subsequent sections.

### 4.5 Subjective vs. Objective Evaluations

Evaluating the quality of generated co-speech gestures involves two primary approaches: subjective evaluations, which rely on human judgment, and objective evaluations, which use computational metrics. Both methods have their strengths and limitations, making them complementary in assessing the effectiveness of gesture generation systems.

Subjective evaluations typically involve human participants rating the naturalness, appropriateness, and expressiveness of synthesized gestures [62]. These ratings are often conducted using Likert-scale questionnaires or through pairwise comparisons where users decide which gestures appear more realistic or aligned with speech content. The advantage of subjective evaluations lies in their ability to capture nuanced aspects such as emotional expressivity, cultural relevance, and contextual grounding that automated metrics might overlook. For instance, studies have demonstrated that users find it challenging to distinguish between real and synthesized gestures when presented with high-quality outputs [62]. However, subjective evaluations also come with notable trade-offs. They tend to be time-consuming, costly, and dependent on the availability of qualified evaluators. Furthermore, inter-rater reliability can vary depending on factors like individual biases, familiarity with gestures, and linguistic backgrounds.

On the other hand, objective evaluations employ quantitative metrics derived from mathematical models and algorithms. Commonly used metrics include synchronization error, velocity prediction accuracy, path length consistency, rhythmicity measures, and motion fidelity [14]. Synchronization error evaluates how well gestures align temporally with speech signals, while velocity prediction ensures smooth transitions between consecutive poses. Path length measures assess whether the amplitude of gestures corresponds appropriately to the intensity of spoken phrases. Additionally, recent works have introduced advanced metrics such as Fréchet Gesture Distance (FGD) and Semantic Relevance Gesture Recall (SRGR) to quantify similarity between generated and reference motions at both structural and semantic levels [34].

Despite these advantages, objective evaluations face certain challenges. First, they often fail to account for higher-order cognitive processes involved in human perception, such as recognizing irony or sarcasm conveyed via gestures [6]. Second, existing metrics predominantly focus on low-level kinematic features rather than holistic impression, potentially leading to misleading conclusions about system performance. Third, defining universal benchmarks remains elusive due to variations in dataset characteristics, experimental setups, and application domains [63].

The choice between subjective and objective evaluations depends largely on specific goals and constraints of research projects. Subjective evaluations offer unparalleled insights into human-centric qualities but require careful planning to ensure statistical significance and minimize bias. Meanwhile, objective evaluations provide rapid feedback and facilitate cross-system comparisons under standardized conditions, albeit sacrificing some granularity. Ideally, combining both approaches yields a balanced perspective by validating computational results against perceptual standards [29].

Another critical dimension in this comparison is granularity. Subjective evaluations allow fine-grained analysis of individual components within a gesture sequence, enabling researchers to identify particular moments where discrepancies occur. In contrast, most objective metrics aggregate errors across entire sequences, obscuring localized issues. This limitation becomes particularly problematic when dealing with long-duration gestures requiring precise timing adjustments relative to speech patterns [43]. Moreover, incorporating additional modalities—such as facial expressions or body posture—into evaluation frameworks further complicates matters since current objective measures lack consensus regarding optimal integration strategies [50].

In terms of reliability, subjective evaluations benefit from established psychometric techniques aimed at reducing variability among raters, such as training sessions and calibration procedures. Nevertheless, achieving consistent outcomes across diverse demographic groups remains an open challenge [32]. Objective evaluations, conversely, depend heavily on data quality and preprocessing steps, which may introduce systematic distortions if improperly handled. Ensuring robustness thus necessitates thorough validation against multiple datasets spanning various contexts [55].

Ultimately, neither approach alone suffices to fully characterize the intricacies of co-speech gesture generation. Researchers must thoughtfully weigh the benefits and drawbacks associated with each method before designing comprehensive evaluation protocols tailored to their unique requirements. By doing so, future advancements stand poised to bridge gaps between theoretical constructs and practical implementations, paving the way toward increasingly sophisticated artificial agents capable of engaging humans through rich multimodal interactions. As co-speech gesture generation evolves, the need for robust and reliable evaluation metrics becomes increasingly critical, especially as emerging metrics like FGD and SRGR gain attention for providing more comprehensive assessments of gesture quality and appropriateness.

### 4.6 New Metrics and Methodologies

As co-speech gesture generation progresses, the importance of robust and reliable evaluation metrics becomes increasingly evident. While traditional approaches rely on subjective human evaluations or basic quantitative measures, these may fall short in capturing the nuanced intricacies of generated gestures. To address this gap, emerging metrics such as Fréchet Gesture Distance (FGD), Semantic Relevance Gesture Recall (SRGR), and rhythm-aware metrics are gaining prominence for their ability to provide more comprehensive assessments of gesture quality and appropriateness.

The Fréchet Gesture Distance [53] adapts the Fréchet Inception Distance from image generation tasks to evaluate motion similarity. By comparing feature distributions extracted from generated and ground truth gestures, FGD provides a numerical score reflecting visual fidelity. Its scalability stems from eliminating the need for manual annotations, making it suitable for large datasets. However, FGD primarily evaluates visual resemblance without considering semantic alignment or contextual relevance, necessitating complementary metrics for holistic assessment.

Semantic Relevance Gesture Recall (SRGR) [53] focuses on the alignment between gestures and accompanying speech. SRGR quantifies how well a model retrieves semantically relevant gestures conditioned on textual input. For example, mentioning "up" should elicit an upward gesture. This metric compares predicted gesture feature vectors with those of semantically appropriate actions. Although SRGR offers insights into semantic coherence, its reliance on predefined mappings may limit adaptability to diverse contexts where gestures can vary within the same semantic category.

Rhythm-aware metrics emphasize temporal synchronization between speech and gestures, crucial for realism as gestures often align with prosodic elements like pauses, stresses, or intonations. One approach defines rhythm windows during which specific gestures are expected based on linguistic markers [10]. These metrics assess adherence to timing constraints, providing fine-grained feedback on synchronization. Incorporating spectral analysis techniques to examine periodicities in audio signals and motion trajectories enhances sensitivity to subtle misalignments.

Multimodal consistency is further explored through cross-modal evaluation frameworks. Adversarial discriminators trained to distinguish real versus fake pairs of speech and gesture sequences [27] implicitly learn criteria for plausible co-occurrences, enabling automated scoring. Pretrained transformers capable of encoding interdependencies across modalities [57] allow direct comparisons of joint representations, advancing multimodal congruence evaluation.

Interpretability in metrics is also gaining traction, with researchers advocating for tools that not only yield numeric scores but also offer actionable insights [51]. Decomposing FGD into components measuring spatial extent, velocity profiles, or energy consumption highlights distinct aspects of gesture realism. Similarly, breaking down SRGR results by gesture type (e.g., iconic vs. beat) aids in pinpointing areas for improvement.

These emerging metrics and methodologies significantly enhance the objective evaluation of co-speech gesture synthesis systems, addressing dimensions such as visual fidelity, semantic alignment, rhythmic precision, and multimodal congruence. They facilitate fair comparisons among competing approaches by establishing standardized benchmarks. As datasets grow larger and more complex, adopting advanced evaluation tools will be indispensable for driving progress and ensuring generalization capabilities.

In summary, innovations like Fréchet Gesture Distance, Semantic Relevance Gesture Recall, and rhythm-aware measures represent crucial advancements in objectively evaluating co-speech gesture generation. These tools complement subjective assessments by offering precise, reproducible, and interpretable evaluations of key attributes. Future research directions include refining existing metrics, exploring hybrid approaches combining multiple criteria, and developing novel frameworks tailored to emerging challenges in personalized or context-specific gesture generation. Ultimately, continuous innovation in evaluation methodologies will remain essential for achieving more natural and engaging human-agent interactions.

## 5 Applications and Practical Use-Cases

### 5.1 Human-Robot Interaction

Co-speech gestures play a critical role in enhancing human-robot interaction (HRI), making communication more natural, intuitive, and effective. By integrating these gestures into HRI systems, robots can better mimic human-like behaviors, fostering trust, engagement, and ease of understanding. This subsection explores how co-speech gestures significantly contribute to various HRI scenarios, including task instruction, collaborative environments, and the development of inclusive and personalized interfaces.

In task instruction contexts, robots often face challenges due to ambiguous or incomplete verbal commands. Co-speech gestures complement speech by providing additional contextual cues that clarify intent [5]. For example, pointing gestures can indicate specific objects or locations, while iconic gestures may depict actions or shapes. Studies have shown that incorporating co-speech gestures into neural network models enhances the robot's ability to interpret and execute complex instructions effectively [5].

Collaborative workspaces represent another domain where co-speech gestures improve human-robot interactions. In shared environments like factories, laboratories, or domestic settings, robots must seamlessly integrate with human team members. Gestures facilitate smoother collaboration by conveying intentions, coordinating actions, and maintaining situational awareness [49]. Deictic gestures, for instance, direct attention to specific areas or tasks, improving efficiency in collaborative scenarios. Furthermore, gestures enable robots to express emotions and social cues, creating a more harmonious working atmosphere.

The development of inclusive and personalized human-robot interfaces is essential for ensuring accessibility across diverse populations. By leveraging co-speech gestures, designers can create interfaces that cater to both verbal and non-verbal communication preferences. These interfaces accommodate individuals who prefer visual over auditory input and support multilingual contexts where gestures transcend language barriers [26]. Recent advancements involve using deep learning architectures, such as transformers and diffusion models, to synthesize personalized and contextually relevant gestures based on user inputs. Such models allow robots to adapt their gestural behavior according to individual styles, cultural norms, and emotional states.

Another key aspect of HRI is sustaining high levels of engagement throughout interactions. Co-speech gestures positively influence perceptions of animacy, intelligence, and focus in robots, making them appear more lifelike and approachable [64]. Research using gaze-tracking technology reveals that participants pay greater attention to robots exhibiting synchronized gestures compared to those without them [64]. Temporal alignment between gestures and speech is crucial for achieving convincing performances; misaligned or exaggerated gestures may undermine the credibility of robotic agents.

Social robots designed for elder care, education, and therapy benefit immensely from co-speech gestures that foster empathy and rapport with users [65]. For example, storytelling robots can use metaphoric gestures to illustrate abstract concepts, enhancing narrative engagement. Similarly, therapeutic robots might employ soothing gestures to calm anxious patients or encourage positive behavioral changes through affirmation.

Despite significant progress, challenges remain in implementing robust co-speech gesture generation systems for HRI applications. Issues include managing one-to-many mappings between speech and gestures, addressing ambiguities in multimodal data fusion, and ensuring consistent synchronization across long sequences [14]. Researchers continue exploring techniques such as latent variable modeling, attention mechanisms, and classifier-free guidance strategies within diffusion frameworks to address these challenges [29].

Finally, ethical considerations surrounding co-speech gesture generation are crucial. Ensuring fairness, reducing biases inherent in training datasets, and respecting privacy rights are paramount when deploying such technologies [2]. Cross-cultural adaptation remains vital to avoid misinterpretations of gestures across different communities. Future research should aim to develop universally applicable yet culturally sensitive solutions that promote equitable access to advanced HRI systems powered by co-speech gestures.

In conclusion, co-speech gestures are indispensable tools for enhancing communication in HRI, spanning task instruction, collaborative environments, interface design, and social robotics. Advances in generative models and multimodal processing continue to refine our ability to synthesize realistic and meaningful gestures, paving the way for increasingly sophisticated HRI applications. Addressing existing challenges and adhering to ethical principles will ensure that co-speech gestures contribute constructively to building stronger partnerships between humans and robots.

### 5.2 Virtual Avatars and Digital Humans

The integration of co-speech gestures into virtual avatars and digital humans has significantly enhanced the naturalness and effectiveness of their interactions in various applications such as online meetings, gaming, and interactive storytelling. Building upon the advancements in human-robot interaction (HRI), these gestures play a crucial role in making digital representations more lifelike and engaging by complementing verbal communication with non-verbal cues. This subsection explores the significance of co-speech gestures in virtual avatar animation and highlights recent advancements through examples of realistic gesture synthesis.

In online meetings, the presence of co-speech gestures can bridge the gap between participants by providing richer non-verbal cues [5]. These gestures not only emphasize key points but also convey emotion and intent, enhancing the overall interaction experience. For instance, systems like "Gesticulator" have demonstrated the ability to produce both beat-aligned and semantically meaningful gestures, which are essential for creating believable conversational agents [8]. By taking both acoustic and semantic representations of speech as input, this model generates gestures that align well with spoken content, thus improving the realism of virtual avatars during meetings or presentations.

The gaming industry has also benefited immensely from incorporating co-speech gestures into character animations. Players expect increasingly immersive experiences where characters behave authentically, reacting appropriately to dialogue through nuanced gestures [7]. Games utilizing advanced gesture synthesis techniques allow players to interact with more convincing NPCs (non-player characters), leading to greater immersion. The ConvoFusion approach exemplifies how multi-modal inputs, including audio and text, enhance the generation process, allowing users even finer control over which words should be emphasized via gestures. Such capabilities pave the way for more personalized and interactive gameplay scenarios.

Interactive storytelling platforms rely heavily on compelling performances delivered by animated characters. Here again, co-speech gestures serve as critical components to evoke empathy among audiences. Systems such as LivelySpeaker focus specifically on ensuring that generated gestures remain highly aligned with the semantics of accompanying speech [28]. Through its two-stage framework—first generating script-based gestures using CLIP embeddings and subsequently refining them based purely on rhythmic audio patterns—the method ensures that resulting motions reflect deep contextual understanding while maintaining synchronization. This level of sophistication allows storytellers to craft narratives driven by visually expressive yet accurate depictions of emotions and ideas.

Moreover, research continues to push boundaries in achieving higher levels of fidelity and diversity within synthesized gestures. Recent developments leveraging diffusion models showcase promising results in addressing challenges associated with temporal coherence and multimodal alignment [42]. For example, DiffGesture introduces an innovative architecture designed around denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), enabling robust modeling of complex relationships between speech and gestures across extended durations without compromising visual quality. Similarly, EMoG employs joint correlation-aware transformers alongside conditional diffusion strategies to better capture intricate dependencies inherent in human motion data [32].

Another notable advancement comes from frameworks emphasizing personalization options available to end-users. Projects like DiffuseStyleGesture empower creators to manipulate stylistic preferences directly within their pipelines [26]. Utilizing classifier-free guidance mechanisms, they achieve flexible style transfers while preserving authenticity. Additionally, projects focusing on cross-domain adaptations ensure compatibility across diverse languages and cultures, broadening applicability further still [53].

Despite remarkable progress, certain limitations persist regarding computational efficiency, real-time performance, and scalability when handling large-scale datasets. Addressing these concerns becomes paramount if we aim at deploying state-of-the-art solutions seamlessly into commercial products targeting millions of simultaneous users globally. Furthermore, ethical considerations surrounding bias mitigation and inclusivity must guide future investigations so that everyone benefits equally from technological breakthroughs achieved thus far.

In conclusion, the application of co-speech gesture generation technology in virtual avatars and digital humans has revolutionized numerous sectors ranging from business communications to entertainment industries. As advances in generative models and multimodal processing continue to refine our ability to synthesize realistic and meaningful gestures, these technologies pave the way for increasingly sophisticated multimedia systems. Future efforts should address existing challenges and adhere to ethical principles, ensuring that co-speech gestures contribute constructively to building stronger and more inclusive interactions in virtual environments.

### 5.3 Multimedia Systems and Content Creation

Co-speech gestures play a pivotal role in enhancing the interactivity and engagement of multimedia systems, making them more compelling for users. These gestures are not merely ancillary but form an integral part of the communication process, enriching user experiences across various platforms such as educational tools, video conferencing software, and content creation for virtual influencers. By integrating advanced techniques in co-speech gesture generation, multimedia systems can deliver richer, more immersive interactions.

Educational platforms benefit significantly from the integration of co-speech gestures, which mimic real-world interactions to improve engagement and retention. Virtual instructors equipped with realistic co-speech gestures can better convey complex ideas through both verbal and non-verbal cues. For example, models like "Robots Learn Social Skills" [5] demonstrate how robots trained on TED talks generate iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and beat gestures that align closely with spoken content, making lessons more relatable and understandable. Additionally, approaches like "Learning Hierarchical Cross-Modal Association for Co-Speech Gesture Generation" [15] utilize hierarchical audio-to-gesture mappings, ensuring fine-grained control over gestures that match the intricacies of educational content.

As computational resources improve alongside algorithmic refinements, real-time adaptation becomes feasible, enabling responsive gestures during live-action sequences. This progression towards higher realism and interactivity sets new standards for digital entertainment, bridging gaps seen in social robotics applications discussed subsequently.

### 5.5 Social and Assistive Robotics

Social and assistive robotics have emerged as transformative fields where co-speech gestures play a pivotal role in enhancing human-robot interaction (HRI). These robots, designed for applications such as elder care, education, and therapy, rely on natural communication to foster user acceptance and engagement. The integration of co-speech gestures into these systems enables robots to mimic human-like behaviors, making interactions more intuitive and relatable [5]. Building on advancements from the entertainment industry, where synchronization between speech and gestures is crucial, this subsection explores how co-speech gestures contribute to elder care, educational support, and therapeutic interventions in social robotics.

In elder care, social robots equipped with co-speech gesture capabilities significantly enhance the quality of life for aging populations. Aging individuals often experience isolation or cognitive decline, which can hinder effective communication. By incorporating co-speech gestures, robots provide companionship, engage seniors in conversations, and even assist with daily tasks. For instance, studies show that gestures like pointing or nodding improve understanding and facilitate smoother communication [67]. Personalized gestures tailored to individual preferences ensure that interactions feel authentic and empathetic, promoting trust between users and robots.

Education represents another domain where co-speech gestures prove invaluable. Assistive robots in educational settings can serve as tutors or interactive learning tools for students of all ages. Gestures help convey abstract concepts, emphasize key points, and maintain student attention during lessons. Research demonstrates that children respond positively to robots displaying iconic gestures (e.g., mimicking shapes or actions) and beat gestures (e.g., rhythmic hand movements aligning with speech patterns) [14]. Furthermore, robots capable of generating culturally relevant gestures cater to diverse student populations, fostering inclusivity in classrooms.

Therapy constitutes yet another critical application area for social robots with co-speech gesture capabilities. In therapeutic contexts, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) treatment or rehabilitation programs, clear and compassionate communication is essential for establishing rapport with patients. Co-speech gestures enable robots to express emotions, demonstrate empathy, and encourage social interaction. For example, metaphoric gestures might symbolize progress or success, motivating patients during recovery processes [62]. Real-time gesture generation ensures synchronization with spoken words, reinforcing verbal messages and reducing ambiguity in communication.

The effectiveness of co-speech gestures in social robots stems from their ability to bridge gaps in nonverbal communication. Similar to humans, robots using gestures appear more relatable and trustworthy. Recent advancements in deep learning architectures, such as transformers and diffusion models, have enabled researchers to develop robust systems capable of generating realistic co-speech gestures. For example, the "Diffusion Co-Speech Gesture" framework leverages denoising diffusion probabilistic models to capture cross-modal audio-to-gesture associations while preserving temporal coherence [42]. Similarly, the "UnifiedGesture" approach employs a retargeting network and reinforcement learning to generate diverse, speech-matched gestures across different motion capture standards [34].

Despite these achievements, challenges remain in fully integrating co-speech gestures into social and assistive robotics. Addressing the one-to-many mapping problem, where multiple viable gestures correspond to the same speech input, requires innovative techniques like latent variable modeling and conditional generation [21]. Ensuring seamless synchronization between speech and gestures also remains critical; misalignment can lead to awkward or unnatural interactions. Techniques such as transformer-based architectures with self-attention mechanisms help address this issue by capturing long-term dependencies between modalities [68].

As we transition into discussions about cross-lingual adaptation and personalized gesture generation, it is important to note that ethical considerations must guide the development of co-speech gesture systems in social and assistive robotics. Ensuring fairness, inclusivity, and privacy remains paramount, especially when designing robots for vulnerable populations. Researchers must carefully curate datasets to minimize biases and promote equitable representation [32]. Transparency in model design and evaluation helps build trust among stakeholders, encouraging wider adoption of these technologies.

In conclusion, co-speech gestures represent a cornerstone of effective human-robot interaction in social and assistive robotics. Their integration enhances communication, fosters engagement, and promotes user acceptance across diverse applications, including elder care, education, and therapy. Advances in data-driven methodologies continue to refine gesture synthesis, addressing longstanding challenges such as one-to-many mappings and synchronization. As research progresses, further exploration of personalized and emotionally expressive gestures will pave the way for increasingly natural and impactful robotic interactions.

### 5.6 Cross-Domain Adaptations and Customizations

The field of co-speech gesture generation has witnessed remarkable advancements, with models evolving to generate gestures tailored to specific contexts or individuals. This customization enhances the naturalness and effectiveness of human-robot or human-avatar interactions, building on the foundational role that gestures play in fostering intuitive communication as discussed earlier [69]. A critical area within this domain is cross-lingual adaptation, which involves designing models capable of generating appropriate gestures across different languages while respecting cultural nuances and ensuring semantic alignment.

Cross-lingual adaptations necessitate models that generalize well across languages without sacrificing output quality. For instance, BEAT [53] highlights the importance of multimodal datasets containing speech, emotions, and gestures in multiple languages. These datasets reveal that gestures vary based on both semantics and linguistic differences, underlining the need for adaptable models. The cascaded architecture proposed in this work integrates these modalities effectively, improving generalization across languages and emotional contexts.

Another dimension of cross-domain adaptation focuses on personalized gesture generation, where models produce unique styles aligned with individual preferences. GesGPT [16], for example, leverages large language models (LLMs) like GPT to parse textual input into semantically rich co-speech gestures. By transforming gesture generation into an intention classification problem, GesGPT offers greater flexibility in producing contextually appropriate gestures, thereby addressing diverse user needs.

Speaker identity also plays a significant role in shaping gesture style. Research such as Speech Gesture Generation from the Trimodal Context of Text, Audio, and Speaker Identity [1] demonstrates how distinct gesture styles can be generated for the same speech content by specifying different speaker identities. Variations in personality traits, gender, age, or regional accents influence gesticulation patterns, providing valuable insights for applications ranging from social robots to virtual influencers.

Environmental constraints further complicate interaction design, especially concerning accessibility and augmented reality environments. Individuals with hearing impairments may benefit from systems emphasizing visual cues over auditory ones. Similarly, augmented reality platforms require an understanding of spatial relationships between users’ movements and digital overlays to ensure that generated gestures complement rather than conflict visually. Studies like Understanding Gesture and Speech Multimodal Interactions for Manipulation Tasks in Augmented Reality Using Unconstrained Elicitation [1] provide critical guidance on timing synchronization between speech and gesture onset times in unconstrained settings.

Real-time performance presents additional challenges, particularly when adapting models dynamically to changing inputs or contexts. Efficient architectures are crucial here, balancing computational resources against responsiveness demands. Innovations such as Unified speech and gesture synthesis using flow matching [1] exemplify progress in this area, demonstrating how optimal transport conditional flow matching reduces memory footprints while enhancing synthesis quality through fewer steps compared to traditional methods.

Evaluation remains pivotal in determining whether adapted versions meet expectations adequately. Metrics like Semantic Relevance Gesture Recall (SRGR), introduced alongside BEAT [53], help assess consistency between verbal and nonverbal expressions. Subjective evaluations via user studies further enrich analyses by gauging perceived appropriateness, naturalness, and overall satisfaction levels among end-users.

In conclusion, ongoing research continues to push the boundaries of co-speech gesture generation, striving for versatile yet finely tuned models suited to varied applications. Through continuous refinement of algorithms and robust global datasets, future developments promise even greater potential for crafting uniquely personalized experiences tailored to individual requirements, bridging gaps identified in prior discussions [69].

## 6 Future Directions and Emerging Trends

### 6.1 Integration of Multimodal Inputs

The integration of multimodal inputs in co-speech gesture generation has advanced significantly, fostering the synthesis of more natural and contextually appropriate gestures. By leveraging audio, text, visual data, and even speaker identity, these models produce gestures that align with speech content and rhythm while enhancing contextual understanding across modalities [14]. This is essential for creating immersive interactions and improving realism.

Audio serves as a primary driver for gesture generation due to its rich acoustic and semantic information. Extracting meaningful features from raw audio signals or using pre-trained models like WavLM enables models to maintain temporal coherence between gestures and speech while generating semantically relevant gestures [12]. Supplementing this with textual input enriches linguistic nuances, further supporting the creation of gestures that are semantically aligned with spoken words [8].

Visual data complements auditory and textual inputs by offering spatial and kinematic details about human motion patterns. Video-based datasets facilitate robust learning of how gestures evolve over time and their relationship with environmental factors [3]. Pose estimation techniques that extract skeletal information directly from images or videos also support direct mapping between speech and body movements [31]. Such methods capture idiosyncratic characteristics of individual speakers' gesturing styles, enhancing personalization.

Incorporating non-verbal cues such as facial expressions and head nods adds another layer of expressivity, conveying emotional states and reinforcing conversational intent [6]. In multi-party conversations, considering interlocutor dynamics becomes crucial since gestures often depend on social contexts involving multiple participants [13]. Handling these complex interactions necessitates advanced architectures capable of managing diverse modalities simultaneously.

Synchronization remains pivotal in effective multimodal integration, requiring precise timing alignment between gestures and corresponding speech segments. Attention mechanisms and specialized pipelines address this challenge; transformer-based models, for instance, use self-attention layers to capture long-range dependencies within speech-gesture pairs [10]. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models iteratively refine noisy samples conditioned on synchronized inputs, ensuring smooth transitions [29].

Contextual grounding ensures that generated gestures reflect real-world situations accurately. Some studies augment input streams with explicit annotations to improve semantic correspondence between verbal and non-verbal components [6], while others focus on disentangled latent spaces for fine-grained control over expressive qualities [26].

Recent advancements highlight the benefits of leveraging pretrained encoders initialized through large-scale corpora spanning diverse domains. These frameworks distill shared abstract concepts embedded within disparate sources of information, reducing reliance on task-specific labeled datasets and promoting transferability across applications [33]. This adaptability supports emerging fields such as virtual reality experiences and telepresence systems.

Despite progress, challenges remain in optimally fusing heterogeneous modalities without compromising quality or efficiency. Future research should explore enhancing cross-modal interaction awareness and developing interpretable metrics to assess contributions from each source [7]. Achieving harmonious coordination among varied sensory streams holds promise for unlocking unprecedented levels of realism in artificially synthesized communicative behaviors.

### 6.2 Enhanced Realism in Gesture Generation

Enhancing the realism of generated gestures is a critical focus in co-speech gesture generation, with emerging techniques emphasizing emotional expressivity, fine-grained motion details, and personalized characteristics to improve user experiences. Realistic gestures must align semantically and rhythmically with speech while capturing nuances such as subtle body movements, speaker-specific traits, and emotional cues, contributing to both contextual appropriateness and visual appeal.

A significant area driving enhanced realism is the incorporation of emotional expressivity into co-speech gestures. Emotional gestures deepen interactions, making them more engaging and authentic [36]. This work introduces an Emotion-Beat Mining module (EBM) to extract emotion features from speech audio and model their correlation with rhythmic beats. By conditioning on these features, the framework generates vivid and diverse emotional gestures. Additionally, the Motion-Smooth Loss addresses jittering effects, ensuring stable and smooth motion outputs. An emotion-conditioned VAE enables sampling of emotion features for varied expressions even with identical input speech.

Fine-grained motion details further enhance realism by capturing nuanced human movement aspects. Techniques leveraging hierarchical structures in speech and gestures have demonstrated success in generating high-fidelity gestures. For instance, "Learning Hierarchical Cross-Modal Association for Co-Speech Gesture Generation" proposes Hierarchical Audio-to-Gesture (HA2G), which uses multi-granular audio representations and gradual pose rendering for finer joint control [15]. Similarly, the diffusion-based method in "Taming Diffusion Models for Audio-Driven Co-Speech Gesture Generation" employs a Diffusion Audio-Gesture Transformer to better attend to cross-modal information and preserve fine-grained motion details during generation [42].

Personalization enhances realism by tailoring gestures to specific speakers or contexts, strengthening the connection between users and virtual agents or robots. The paper "Speech Gesture Generation from the Trimodal Context of Text, Audio, and Speaker Identity" incorporates speaker identity alongside text and audio inputs to reliably generate personalized gestures [25]. Learning style embeddings from videos of various speakers allows the model to produce distinct gesture styles for the same speech content. Furthermore, "C2G2  Controllable Co-speech Gesture Generation with Latent Diffusion Model" proposes a speaker-specific decoder to ensure consistent gesture appearance conditioned on speaker identities [29].

Multimodal inputs contribute to enhancing realism by providing richer contextual information for gesture generation. Frameworks like ConvoFusion leverage both audio and text modalities for controllable synthesis, enabling alignment with both speech rhythms and semantic meanings [7]. The MPE4G framework utilizes a multimodal pre-trained encoder trained via self-supervised learning to handle noisy or missing input modalities robustly [33], ensuring consistent performance across diverse scenarios.

Advanced generative models, particularly diffusion models and transformers, play pivotal roles in achieving enhanced realism. Diffusion models offer advantages in mode coverage, diversity, and temporal coherence [26], allowing fine-tuned control over gesture properties through mechanisms such as classifier-free guidance. For example, DiffGesture uses an effective Diffusion Gesture Stabilizer with an annealed noise sampling strategy to eliminate temporal inconsistencies [42]. Transformer-based architectures excel at capturing long-range dependencies for smoother, more natural transitions in generated motions [34].

Advances in dataset construction and annotation practices support efforts toward enhanced realism. High-quality, large-scale datasets containing diverse examples of co-speech gestures provide valuable training data for improving model generalization and expressiveness [53]. Metrics such as Fréchet Gesture Distance (FGD) and Semantic Relevance Gesture Recall (SRGR) guide researchers in refining models for higher fidelity [53].

As research progresses, integrating additional contextual factors, such as environmental cues and interlocutor dynamics, will likely further enhance the realism of co-speech gestures. Future work may explore how grounding gestures within broader conversational or situational contexts impacts perceived naturalness and engagement [13]. Overall, combining advanced generative models, personalized approaches, fine-grained motion details, and rich multimodal inputs holds significant potential for advancing realistic co-speech gesture generation, setting the stage for inclusive cross-lingual systems.

### 6.3 Cross-Lingual Adaptation

Cross-lingual adaptation in co-speech gesture generation is an emerging research direction that holds immense potential for creating more inclusive and culturally relevant systems. The ability to generalize across languages while preserving cultural nuances and maintaining alignment between gestures and speech is critical for enabling effective communication in multilingual environments. Building upon advancements in realism, personalization, and multimodal inputs, cross-lingual gesture generation further extends the capabilities of co-speech systems by addressing diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

One of the primary challenges in cross-lingual adaptation lies in understanding how different languages influence gesticulation patterns. Gestures are not only language-dependent but also deeply tied to cultural contexts. For instance, a gesture that conveys agreement in one culture might signify something entirely different in another. A study exploring multimodal conversational agents emphasized the importance of incorporating speaker identity and context to ensure culturally appropriate gestures [25]. Such considerations become even more crucial when extending gesture synthesis to multiple languages.

To address these challenges, researchers have begun investigating ways to leverage shared linguistic features and universal gesture primitives. One promising approach involves pre-training models on diverse datasets that span multiple languages and cultures. By doing so, models can learn to recognize commonalities in gesture-speech relationships while still respecting language-specific differences. The paper "MPE4G: Multimodal Pretrained Encoder for Co-Speech Gesture Generation" introduces a multimodal pretrained encoder that captures robust encodings of input modalities, facilitating cross-lingual generalization [33]. This method allows the model to handle missing or noisy input modalities, making it adaptable to varying data conditions typical in cross-lingual settings.

Another key aspect of cross-lingual adaptation is ensuring semantic coherence across languages. Semantically meaningful gestures often rely on specific word choices or syntactic structures unique to each language. To tackle this challenge, some studies propose integrating advanced natural language processing techniques with gesture synthesis frameworks. For example, the GesGPT framework leverages large language models (LLMs) such as GPT to extract rich semantic information from textual inputs, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures [16]. Similarly, the LivelySpeaker framework uses CLIP text embeddings to guide the generation of semantically aligned gestures [28]. These approaches demonstrate the importance of aligning gesture semantics with the nuances of spoken content across different languages.

Moreover, cross-lingual gesture generation must account for rhythm and prosody, which vary significantly across languages. Beat gestures, in particular, depend heavily on the phonetic and prosodic properties of speech. The Rhythmic Gesticulator system explicitly addresses this issue by incorporating a robust rhythm-based segmentation pipeline to ensure temporal coherence between vocalizations and gestures [10]. Extending such rhythm-aware mechanisms to multiple languages would require adapting them to the distinct prosodic characteristics of each target language.

Cultural specificity adds another layer of complexity to cross-lingual adaptation. Gestures carry significant cultural meanings, and misaligned gestures can lead to misunderstandings or even offense. Therefore, models must be trained to respect cultural conventions while synthesizing gestures. One way to achieve this is through style conditioning, where models learn to generate gestures conditioned on cultural or stylistic cues. The DiffuseStyleGesture framework exemplifies this approach by introducing classifier-free guidance to control gesture style via interpolation or extrapolation [26]. Such flexibility enables the generation of culturally sensitive gestures tailored to specific linguistic communities.

Furthermore, dataset diversity plays a pivotal role in successful cross-lingual adaptation. Current datasets predominantly focus on English-speaking populations, limiting their applicability to other languages. Expanding the scope of training data to include speakers of various languages and dialects will enhance the robustness of gesture generation models. The ConvoFusion framework addresses this limitation by releasing the DnD Group Gesture dataset, which includes 6 hours of multi-party interaction data [7]. Such datasets provide valuable resources for training models capable of handling diverse linguistic and cultural scenarios.

Despite these advancements, several challenges remain unresolved. One major obstacle is the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for assessing cross-lingual gesture quality. While quantitative measures like motion fidelity and synchronization error are useful, they fail to capture the subtleties of cultural appropriateness and semantic alignment. Subjective evaluations involving human raters fluent in multiple languages can help bridge this gap. The GENEA Challenge 2020 highlights the importance of benchmarking gesture generation systems using large-scale crowdsourced evaluations [48]. Adapting such methodologies to cross-lingual settings will enable more comprehensive assessments of model performance.

As co-speech gesture generation continues to advance, ethical considerations surrounding inclusivity and fairness become increasingly important. Cross-lingual systems must ensure equitable representation across languages and cultures to avoid perpetuating biases or marginalizing underrepresented groups. Bridging the gap between technical innovation and ethical responsibility will play a crucial role in shaping the future of co-speech gesture technology.

In conclusion, cross-lingual adaptation represents a vital frontier in co-speech gesture generation research. By leveraging shared linguistic features, integrating advanced NLP techniques, and accounting for cultural specificity, models can generalize effectively across languages. However, realizing this potential requires addressing challenges related to dataset diversity, rhythmic alignment, and evaluation metrics. As the field continues to evolve, fostering collaboration between linguists, computer scientists, and cultural experts will be essential for advancing cross-lingual gesture synthesis and promoting inclusive communication technologies.

### 6.4 Ethical Considerations in Co-Speech Gesture Generation

As co-speech gesture generation continues to advance, addressing ethical considerations becomes essential for ensuring the technology's effectiveness, safety, and societal acceptance. Key concerns include biases in training data, privacy issues, fairness, inclusivity, and transparency. These factors directly influence the development of robust, equitable, and culturally sensitive systems.

Biases in training data pose a significant challenge, as they can lead to unfair or inappropriate gestures being generated. For example, datasets dominated by gestures from specific demographic groups may result in models struggling to produce culturally appropriate gestures for underrepresented populations [14]. To mitigate this, researchers must prioritize diverse and representative datasets that reflect real-world human interactions. A lack of diversity in training data risks perpetuating stereotypes and excluding marginalized communities, undermining inclusivity goals.

Privacy issues also warrant attention, given the sensitive nature of personal data such as audio recordings or video footage used in co-speech gesture systems. For instance, identifying individuals based on their unique gestural patterns raises concerns about unauthorized access or misuse of user information [70]. Ensuring strong safeguards against breaches is crucial for maintaining public trust in these technologies.

Fairness and inclusivity in generated outputs are paramount for creating respectful and meaningful interactions across cultures and communities. Fairness involves avoiding discrimination against any group, while inclusivity accommodates diverse cultural practices within synthesized gestures. Cross-cultural variations in communication styles must be accounted for to ensure gestures remain culturally relevant [3]. Additionally, inclusivity should extend to recognizing disabilities affecting gestural expression, requiring specialized adjustments in algorithms to accommodate motor impairments accurately [40].

Transparency in decision-making processes further enhances ethical standards compliance. Users should understand the types of data informing their synthetic content, enabling them to make informed choices about engaging with it. Providing mechanisms for contesting potentially harmful outcomes fosters accountability within the field [9].

The integration of large language models (LLMs) into gesture analysis and generation amplifies ethical considerations. While LLMs offer immense capacity due to extensive training datasets, they risk perpetuating existing social inequities unless adequately mitigated [71]. Developers must implement rigorous evaluation protocols aligned with ethical criteria before deploying solutions at scale.

Collaboration among stakeholders—researchers, policymakers, ethicists, and end-users—is vital for addressing emerging dilemmas surrounding co-speech gesture generation. Such partnerships facilitate comprehensive assessments of impacts across technical functionality and broader socio-economic dimensions, promoting consensus-building toward universally accepted guidelines [26].

In conclusion, integrating ethical considerations into co-speech gesture generation research and application ensures responsible innovation. By addressing biases, safeguarding privacy, promoting fairness and inclusivity, enhancing transparency, managing risks associated with advanced techniques like LLMs, and fostering multi-stakeholder dialogues, we can unlock the full potential of this technology responsibly. This commitment contributes positively to enhancing human-computer interaction experiences globally.

### 6.5 Advancements in Generative Models

Recent advancements in generative models have significantly impacted the field of co-speech gesture generation, enabling more realistic, diverse, and contextually appropriate outputs. Among these advancements, transformers, GANs, and diffusion models stand out as particularly influential frameworks due to their ability to handle complex multimodal interactions between speech and gestures. These models not only improve gesture quality but also address challenges such as one-to-many mappings and temporal synchronization, aligning closely with ethical considerations like inclusivity and cultural sensitivity.

Transformers, originally developed for natural language processing tasks, have been adapted to model sequential data in co-speech gesture generation. The transformer architecture leverages self-attention mechanisms that allow the model to weigh different parts of the input sequence dynamically, capturing long-term dependencies and fine-grained correlations between speech and gestures. For instance, the paper "Taming Diffusion Models for Audio-Driven Co-Speech Gesture Generation" introduces a novel Diffusion Audio-Gesture Transformer designed to better attend to information from multiple modalities while modeling long-term temporal dependencies [42]. Similarly, "UnifiedGesture: A Unified Gesture Synthesis Model for Multiple Skeletons" uses cross-local attention and self-attention mechanisms within a diffusion model framework to generate better speech-matched and realistic gestures [34]. Such architectures demonstrate the versatility of transformers in integrating multimodal inputs like audio and text for enhanced gesture synthesis.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have traditionally played a pivotal role in generating high-quality gestures. GANs operate by pitting two neural networks—a generator and a discriminator—against each other. The generator creates synthetic samples, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish real samples from fake ones. This adversarial training process leads to increasingly realistic outputs over time. In the context of co-speech gesture generation, papers such as "Speech-Gesture GAN: Gesture Generation for Robots and Embodied Agents" demonstrate how conditional GANs can learn relationships between co-speech gestures and both semantic and acoustic features extracted from speech inputs [68]. Another example is found in "Passing a Non-verbal Turing Test: Evaluating Gesture Animations Generated from Speech," where GANs are employed to model the correlation rather than causation between speech and gestures, approximating neuroscience findings on non-verbal communication [62]. However, despite their success, GANs often suffer from issues like mode collapse and unstable training, which limit their effectiveness in some scenarios.

Diffusion models represent another significant advancement in generative techniques, offering a promising alternative to GANs. Unlike GANs, diffusion models incrementally add noise to data during training and then reverse this process at inference time to produce clean samples. This approach has proven effective in generating high-fidelity co-speech gestures with strong audio correlations. Papers such as "Taming Diffusion Models for Audio-Driven Co-Speech Gesture Generation" and "C2G2: Controllable Co-speech Gesture Generation with Latent Diffusion Model" showcase the utility of diffusion models in capturing cross-modal audio-to-gesture associations while preserving temporal coherence [42], [29]. Furthermore, the integration of implicit classifier-free guidance allows researchers to trade off between diversity and gesture quality, addressing the one-to-many mapping challenge inherent in co-speech gesture generation.

One notable strength of modern generative models lies in their capacity to incorporate additional modalities and conditioning factors, enhancing the realism and expressivity of generated gestures. For example, "EMoG: Synthesizing Emotive Co-speech 3D Gesture with Diffusion Model" incorporates emotion clues to guide the generation process, making it easier to handle the one-to-many nature of speech-content-to-gesture mappings [32]. Additionally, "Freetalker: Controllable Speech and Text-Driven Gesture Generation Based on Diffusion Models for Enhanced Speaker Naturalness" extends the scope of gesture generation by including non-spontaneous speaker motions, demonstrating the potential of diffusion models to generalize across various types of motion data [55]. By employing unified representations and leveraging heterogeneous datasets, these models achieve superior generalizability and controllability compared to earlier approaches.

In addition to improving gesture quality, recent generative models focus on providing rich editing capabilities for content creators. The paper "A Unified Editing Method for Co-Speech Gesture Generation via Diffusion Inversion" proposes a framework utilizing diffusion inversion to enable multi-level editing without re-training [47]. Through reconstruction of intermediate noise from gestures and regeneration of new gestures from this noise, the method facilitates high-level similarity preservation under different speech conditions. Moreover, low-level details such as joint rotation or velocity can be controlled through optimization using custom-designed loss functions, showcasing the flexibility of invertible diffusion models.

The evolution of generative models also highlights their increasing ability to manage complex multimodal interactions. Traditional rule-based systems struggled to account for variations in speaker identity, emotional states, and environmental contexts. Modern deep learning approaches, however, leverage latent variable representations and advanced fusion techniques to align gestures with corresponding speech signals more effectively. As demonstrated in "Audio is All in One: Speech-Driven Gesture Synthetics Using WavLM Pre-Trained Model," pre-trained models like WavLM can extract low-level and high-level audio information, enabling the synthesis of individualized and stylized full-body co-speech gestures solely from raw speech audio [12].

Looking ahead, future research directions include refining existing models to further enhance gesture expressivity and interactivity while adhering to ethical standards discussed earlier. Potential improvements involve developing hybrid architectures combining the strengths of transformers, GANs, and diffusion models, as well as exploring novel ways to integrate contextual information into the generation process. Such advancements will ensure that co-speech gesture systems remain inclusive, fair, and culturally sensitive.
