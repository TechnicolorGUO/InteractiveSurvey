# 0. Data-Driven Co-Speech Gesture Generation  

# 1. Introduction  

Co-speech gestures constitute a fundamental component of human communication, serving to enhance verbal meaning, regulate conversational flow, and convey emotional states [3,9]. The ability to automatically generate natural and expressive co-speech gestures is critical for the development of realistic and engaging interactive applications, such as virtual avatars, social robots, and multimodal human-computer interaction systems [5,10,11]. Research into automated gesture generation spans nearly three decades [6], evolving from early rule-based systems to sophisticated data-driven methodologies [5]. Traditional rule-based approaches often relied on handcrafted rules and finite state machines, which struggled to capture the idiosyncratic, non-periodic nature and subtle nuances of human gesture motion [5]. The advent of larger datasets and significant advancements in deep learning has catalyzed a paradigm shift towards data-driven generative models [5]. These approaches leverage extensive corpora of human speech and motion data to learn complex, high-dimensional mappings between verbal and non-verbal communication, enabling the generation of more natural, diverse, and contextually appropriate gestures than previously possible [5]. Data-driven methods are particularly crucial for modeling the intricate correlations between modalities and the subtle expressivity that colors communicative behaviors [12].

Despite the progress facilitated by data-driven techniques, the field of co-speech gesture generation faces several significant challenges. A primary difficulty lies in the inherent weak correlation and ambiguity between language and gestures; gestures do not always have a direct, one-to-one semantic correspondence with speech [6,11]. Furthermore, human cospeech gestures are characterized by high dimensionality, involving complex movements of the entire body or specific parts like hands and mouth [5,9]. Generating long, coherent gesture sequences that appropriately reflect shifts in emotional state presents another considerable hurdle, particularly as many existing methods primarily focus on generating gestures for single emotional labels [3,4]. The lack of large-scale, diverse datasets, especially those capturing emotional transitions or specific behavioral styles, remains a limiting factor [4]. Additional challenges include the need to accurately capture  

behavior style, which is pervasive across communication [12], and ensuring that generated motions align with subjective human perception of naturalness and quality, surpassing the limitations of traditional objective metrics [7]. Addressing these challenges necessitates sophisticated models capable of disentangling content and style [12], modeling emotion and rhythm [3], understanding the brain's processing of gesture-language interactions [15], and potentially leveraging novel training paradigms like optimal-transport conditional flow matching for unified synthesis [1].  

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in data-driven co-speech gesture generation. It begins by examining foundational data-driven approaches, followed by a detailed analysis of methods addressing specific aspects such as modeling linguistic, acoustic, and emotional cues. We then explore techniques for improving gesture naturalness and diversity, including the integration of style and personality. The survey concludes with a discussion of current evaluation methodologies, remaining challenges, and promising future research directions in this dynamic field.​  

# 2. Foundations and Background  

Co-speech gestures are non-verbal body movements, primarily involving the hands and arms, that naturally accompany spoken language. They are distinct from emblems, which are conventional gestures conveying meaning independently of speech, such as a "thumbs-up" [15]. Co-speech gestures, conversely, contribute meaning by complementing, extending, or reinforcing the spoken message [11,15]. They can illustrate ideas, mimic actions, indicate spatial locations, or mark emphasis [11]. Observers integrate these gestures with speech, potentially automatically, to derive comprehensive meaning [15].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Gesture Type</td><td>Primary Function</td><td>Relationship to Speech</td><td>Example/Description</td></tr><tr><td>Co-speech</td><td>Enhance, Regulate, Convey Emotion</td><td>Accompanies, Complements, Reinforces</td><td>Illustrative, Mimicry, Spatial, Emphasis</td></tr><tr><td>Deictic</td><td>Provide Referential Information</td><td>Aligned with reference</td><td>Pointing</td></tr><tr><td>Beat</td><td>Mark Rhythm or Emphasis</td><td>Temporally aligned with speech</td><td>Simple,rhythmic movements</td></tr><tr><td>Iconic</td><td>Convey Semantic Content (Form)</td><td>Complements semantic content</td><td>Mimicking actions</td></tr><tr><td>Metaphoric</td><td>Convey Semantic Content (Abstract)</td><td>Complements abstract concepts</td><td>Gesture for'idea'or 'growth'</td></tr><tr><td>Emblems</td><td>Convey Meaning Independently</td><td>Replaces or independent of speech</td><td>Thumbs-up, OK sign (Distinct from co- speech)</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Different types of co-speech gestures serve distinct functions: deictic gestures provide referential information, beat gestures mark rhythm or emphasis, while iconic and metaphoric gestures convey semantic content that complements speech [15].  

The interplay between gestures, speech, and cognitive processes is a key area of study. Linguistic theories often posit a clos relationship between verbal and non-verbal communication. For instance, McNeill's Growth Point Theory suggests that gestures and speech originate from a common mental process, influenced by embodied cognition and shared mental imagery [11]. This perspective highlights how deeply intertwined speech and gesture are in terms of both meaning and timing [11]. More recent research aligns with this understanding by explicitly modeling the relationship between speech/text and gestures along rhythmic and semantic dimensions, aiming for temporal harmony and clear semantic content in generated gestures [6]. This approach is rooted in established linguistic theories regarding gesture-language relationships [6]. Furthermore, human behavior style, encompassing linguistics, speech prosody, and nonverbal behavior like gestures, is considered a socially meaningful clustering of features across modalities, often unfolding over time and attuned to the audience [12].​  

Generating realistic co-speech gestures computationally requires understanding fundamental technical concepts. A core challenge is hand pose estimation, which involves determining the configuration of the hand. Hand pose estimation faces numerous difficulties, including low image resolution, cluttered backgrounds, object interactions, occlusions, self-similarity of hand parts, high degrees of freedom (DoF), variations in viewpoint, and differences in hand shape and size [8]. These challenges are particularly relevant when estimating hand poses for co-speech gestures from visual data [8]. Hand pose estimation methods are broadly categorized into generative and discriminative approaches [8]. Generative methods typically synthesize a large set of potential hand configurations and select the one that best matches the input data, such as a depth image [8]. Discriminative methods, in contrast, learn a direct mapping from input data (e.g., depth images) to hand configurations [8]. While these visual methods are prevalent, other sensing modalities, such as force myography (FMG), can also be used to quantify limb movements from muscle contractions, supporting applications like gesture recognition and human-robot interaction [14]. Effective gesture recognition, crucial for understanding human input in multimodal interaction, is challenged by cultural differences, varying environments, noise, and the need to capture spatiotemporal information [16].​  

The representation of gesture data significantly impacts subsequent modeling and the realism of generated movements. Common representations include joint positions, joint rotations (angles), velocities, and more abstract learned representations [8]. The choice of representation affects the complexity of the model required, the computational efficiency, and the ability to capture subtle nuances of human movement. For instance, representing gestures by joint positions or rotations directly relates to the degrees of freedom of the articulated hand [8]. Learned representations, often derived through deep learning techniques, may capture higher-level features or stylistic elements but can be less interpretable. The challenges inherent in both gesture recognition and hand pose estimation underscore the complexity of processing and representing human movement effectively [8,16].​  

# 3. Datasets and Data Preparation  

The efficacy of data-driven co-speech gesture generation models is fundamentally dependent on the quality, quantity, and characteristics of the training data. A variety of datasets are utilized in this field, ranging from those specifically designed for gesture generation to those adapted from related domains like talking head synthesis [13,17]. Datasets specifically curated for gesture research include BEAT, BEAT2, TED Gesture Dataset, Talking With Hands 16.2M, and BIGE [17]. Other datasets like DVS128 Gesture Dataset and IsoGD or SKIG are also employed, though their specific characteristics, such as size or recording environment, are not consistently detailed across summaries [16,17].  

Given the overlap between gesture generation and talking head synthesis, datasets from the latter field are frequently leveraged [13]. These encompass a broad spectrum, including large-scale audio-visual datasets primarily for speaker recognition, such as VoxCeleb, VoxCeleb1, and VoxCeleb2 (with VoxCeleb2 being the largest public offering) [13]. Other relevant datasets feature diverse actors and emotions (CREMA-D, SAVEE), focus on high-definition or 3D facial data (HDTF, BIWI(3D), VOCA, Multiface(3D), MMFace4D, VFHQ), or are tailored for tasks like lip reading (LRW, LRS2, GRID) [13]. Datasets like CelebV and CelebV-HQ provide detailed facial attribute labels, including appearance, action, and emotion, with CelebVHQ offering high-resolution clips and extensive manual annotations [13]. MEAD 2020 explicitly includes emotion and intensity labels, focusing on facial generation for emotional speech [13]. Specialized datasets like ObamaSet focus on specific individuals [13]. The MultiTalk dataset provides a large-scale, multilingual 2D video resource [13], while CN-CVS and CN-Celeb-AV offer Mandarin Chinese alternatives covering various genres [13]. Beyond audio-visual inputs, some studies explore alternative modalities like Force Myography (FMG) signals, requiring custom data acquisition setups [14]. Datasets like PATS Corpus integrate multi-modal data including 2D pose sequences, Mel spectrograms, and BERT embeddings, captured from diverse speakers with varying behavior styles [12]. Perception-based evaluation datasets like MotionPercept are also created to evaluate the quality of generated motions [7].

Despite the availability of these resources, existing datasets exhibit limitations for comprehensive co-speech gesture generation. Common issues include data scarcity for specific scenarios or gesture types, lack of granular emotion or stylistic annotations, and potential biases inherent in the collection process [8,13]. For instance, real-world datasets used for pose estimation, such as the ICL dataset, can suffer from significant variance in manual annotations (up to $2 0 \%$ ) across different annotators [8]. The challenge of obtaining realistic 3D pose annotations is particularly notable [4]. The absence of datasets specifically designed for emotional transition speech and corresponding realistic 3D pose annotations presents a significant hurdle for generating dynamic emotional gestures [4].  

Researchers employ several strategies to mitigate these data limitations. Constructing new datasets tailored to specific needs is one approach, such as creating datasets with explicit emotion transition labels [4]. Novel methods for data generation are also explored, including using large language models like ChatGPT-4 and audio inpainting to synthesize highfidelity emotion transition speeches [4]. Adapting datasets from related tasks, particularly talking head synthesis, is a common practice [13]. Furthermore, synthetic or quasi-synthetic data generation methods are utilized, where data is created computationally (e.g., UCI-EGO) or real data is augmented via geometric transformations to increase dataset size and potentially avoid annotation issues [8]. Addressing data labeling problems also involves employing semi-supervised and weakly-supervised learning techniques [4,8]. Innovative pipelines, such as the one used to construct the MuLAn dataset for controllable image generation by decomposing RGB images into multi-layer RGBA annotations, illustrate sophisticated approaches to data creation and annotation that could potentially inform gesture dataset design [19].​  

The quality of data and the subsequent preprocessing steps are paramount for achieving high model performance and generalization in gesture generation. Issues such as jittering effects in existing datasets can lead to the generation of unstable gestures [3]. Preprocessing techniques like normalization, smoothing, and data augmentation are essential to address these issues [3,8]. For example, a Motion-Smooth Loss function has been proposed to model motion offset and compensate for jittering ground truth, promoting smoother generated movements [3]. In the context of hand pose estimation data, passive motion capture systems can be used for data acquisition, and techniques like semi-supervised and weakly-supervised learning help address data labeling challenges [8]. For FMG signals, preprocessing involves sliding windows, debiasing by subtracting the mean, and calculating features like Power Spectral Density (PSD) and likelihood based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), potentially combined into a feature vector Q(n) using weighted sums of PSD and likelihood values over a window [14]. The PSD is calculated using the formula:​  

$$
P S D = \left| X \right| ^ { 2 } f _ { s } \cdot w ,
$$  

where  

$$
X = \sum _ { m = 0 } ^ { N - 1 } x _ { w } \ e ^ { \frac { - 2 \pi i ( m - 1 ) } { N } }
$$  

is the frequency domain representation, N is the length of the frequency window, $\mathsf { f } \bigotimes$ is the sampling frequency, w is the window length, and x_w is the signal segment [14]. The likelihood $1 \bigtriangledown$ incorporates a posteriori $( \mathsf { k } \boxtimes )$ and a priori $( \mathsf { M } \boxtimes )$ SNR, and is calculated as​  

$$
l _ { n } = k _ { s } \times \frac { M _ { s } } { 1 + M _ { s } } - \log ( 1 + M _ { s } )
$$  

[14].​  

The choice of data representation significantly influences the required preprocessing steps. Raw video data necessitates processing for feature extraction, while skeleton data (2D or 3D pose) often requires normalization, re-rooting, and potentially converting joint positions into relative representations, such as the concatenation of unit direction vectors between joints [2]. For N frames and J joints, this involves representing each frame’s skeleton pᵢ as a series of vectors dᵢ,ⱼ between joint j and $\mathbf { j } { + } \mathbf { 1 }$ [2]. Other modalities like Mel spectrograms for audio or BERT embeddings for text require different feature extraction and potential alignment procedures [12]. Furthermore, noisy or less reliable data, such as detailed finger data from OpenPose, may be excluded during representation conversion to improve model robustness [12].  

# 4. Data-Driven Modeling Approaches  

Data-driven approaches have become the dominant paradigm for co-speech gesture generation, leveraging large datasets of human motion and speech to train complex models capable of synthesizing realistic and contextually relevant gestures. These models typically learn a mapping from various input modalities, such as audio, text, emotion, and context, to sequences of gesture parameters.

This section reviews the primary architectural families that underpin these data-driven methods, discussing their fundamental principles, applications in gesture generation, comparative strengths and weaknesses, and how they handle diverse input streams.  

Sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformer networks, form a cornerstone in this field due to the sequential nature of both speech/text inputs and gesture outputs. Early work frequently employed RNNs, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and their variants like Convolutional LSTMs (ConvLSTMs), to process temporal data and capture dependencies [16,18]. LSTMs and GRUs improved upon basic RNNs by mitigating vanishing gradients, though capturing very long-range dependencies remained challenging. Transformers have emerged as a powerful alternative, utilizing attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel and effectively capture global dependencies regardless of distance [2,3,12]. The attention mechanism, typically formulated as \​  

allows models to dynamically weigh the importance of different input segments for generating each gesture element, which is crucial for multimodal alignment [2]. While Transformers generally outperform RNNs in handling long sequences and  

variable lengths due to parallelism and self-attention, typical end-to-end Seq2Seq systems can struggle with fine-grained temporal synchronization. This limitation has prompted research into supplementary modules or explicit pipelines, such as a "Rhythm-based Normalized Pipeline," to enhance temporal coherence [6]. Seq2Seq models effectively integrate multimodal inputs like audio, text embeddings, and emotional cues, often conditioned on style information [3,12].  

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) represent another significant paradigm, employing an adversarial process where a generator creates samples and a discriminator attempts to distinguish them from real data [20]. This competitive training can lead to the generation of highly realistic and diverse data. In gesture synthesis, adversarial components have been used for tasks like disentangling style and content in multimodal streams, training a discriminator to predict style from content [12]. Adversarial loss functions, such as  

are crafted to achieve specific generation properties [12]. However, training GANs for complex sequences like gestures presents challenges, including mode collapse (limited diversity) and training instability, which remain active research areas [20]. GANs have also found applications beyond direct synthesis, including privacy-preserving data publishing [20].  

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) offer a probabilistic approach to modeling gesture data distributions. They consist of an encoder mapping inputs to a structured latent space (a distribution) and a decoder reconstructing gestures from samples [3]. The probabilistic latent space is a key advantage, enabling the generation of diverse gestures by sampling different points. Manipulating latent variables allows for control over gesture characteristics. Conditioning VAEs on additional inputs, such as emotion, enables targeted generation of emotionally expressive gestures and provides explicit control over the emotional tone [3]. This demonstrates how VAEs can enhance diversity and controllability by structuring the latent space based on desired attributes.​  

More recently, Diffusion Models (DMs) and Flow-Based Models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks. Diffusion models learn to reverse a process that adds noise to data, synthesizing samples by gradually denoising random inputs [2]. This has been applied to produce high-fidelity, audio-aligned gestures, integrating latent motion features for nuanced representation [2,9]. Architectures like the Diffusion Audio-Gesture Transformer incorporate attention for temporal capture [2]. DMs also offer advanced capabilities like multi-level editing via diffusion inversion, allowing modifications without retraining [19]. Maintaining temporal consistency in sequential data is a challenge for DMs, addressed by techniques like thresholding and smooth sampling, which regulate noise application across time steps [2]. Flow-Based Models, such as Optimal-Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT-CFM), define invertible mappings from simple distributions to data distributions [1]. OT-CFM has shown promise for unified speech and gesture synthesis, achieving high quality with greater efficiency than prior methods [1]. Compared to GANs and VAEs, Diffusion and Flow-Based models often exhibit more stable training and can achieve high sample quality and efficiency [1].  

In summary, data-driven gesture generation has evolved from early RNN-based Seq2Seq models to more advanced Transformers, probabilistic models like VAEs, and cutting-edge Diffusion and Flow-Based models. Each architecture family offers distinct advantages and faces specific challenges. Seq2Seq models excel at learning temporal mappings but may require explicit mechanisms for fine-grained temporal synchronization. GANs can generate highly realistic and diverse gestures but are prone to training instability and mode collapse. VAEs provide a structured latent space for controllable and diverse generation. Diffusion and Flow-Based models offer promising alternatives with improved stability, sample quality, and efficiency, though ensuring perfect temporal coherence remains an area of focus. Integrating diverse input modalities (audio, text, emotion, style) is crucial across all approaches, with different architectures employing distinct mechanisms like attention or conditional inputs to leverage this information. Future research directions include improving training stability, enhancing temporal coherence and fine-grained synchronization, achieving better controllability over various gesture attributes, and increasing computational efficiency, especially for real-time applications.​  

# 4.1 Sequence-to-Sequence Models (RNNs, Transformers)  

Sequence-to-sequence models form a cornerstone in data-driven co-speech gesture generation due to the inherent temporal nature of both input modalities (speech, audio, or text) and the desired output (gesture sequences). These models are designed to map an input sequence to an output sequence, making them well-suited for capturing the temporal alignment and dependencies between speech/text features and corresponding gestures.  

Early approaches frequently utilized Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to process the sequential data. Variants like the Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) integrate convolutional operations within the LSTM structure [18]. ConvLSTMs are employed to capture long-term temporal and spatiotemporal dependencies in feature maps [16]. RNNs process sequences step by step, maintaining a hidden state that summarizes past information. While LSTMs and gated recurrent units (GRUs) mitigate the vanishing gradient problem compared to basic RNNs, capturing very long-range dependencies across extended sequences can still present challenges.  

More recently, Transformer architectures have gained prominence in co-speech gesture generation. Transformers leverage attention mechanisms to process sequences in parallel, enabling more effective capture of global dependencies irrespective of the distance between elements in the sequence. These models have been applied to generate 3D co-speech gestures based on various features, including audio and emotional cues [3], as well as upper-body behavior from text embeddings and Mel spectrograms, often conditioned on style information [12]. A Diffusion Audio-Gesture Transformer, for example, explicitly leverages attention mechanisms to capture temporal information between audio and gestures [2].​  

A key component distinguishing Transformers is the attention mechanism. Attention allows the model to dynamically weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence(s) when generating each element of the output sequence. This is particularly valuable in multimodal tasks like co-speech gesture generation, where aligning speech/text content or rhythm with appropriate gestures is crucial. The attention mechanism is commonly formulated as:​  

$$
\mathrm { A t t e n t i o n } ( Q , K , V ) = \mathrm { s o f t m a x } \left( { \frac { Q K ^ { T } } { \sqrt { l } } } \right) V
$$  

where $\mathsf { Q } , \mathsf { K } ,$ and $\mathsf { V }$ are matrices representing queries, keys, and values derived from the input features, and $\backslash ( 1 \backslash )$ is a scaling factor [2]. This mechanism facilitates the alignment of multimodal inputs by allowing the gesture generation process to attend to the most relevant audio or text segments at each time step, thereby capturing complex temporal dependencies [2].  

Comparing RNNs and Transformers, the latter generally demonstrate superior capability in handling long-range dependencies and processing variable-length sequences efficiently due to their parallel processing and self-attention mechanisms, which contrast with the sequential processing of RNNs. Different architectural choices within the Transformer framework also exist, such as employing a Transformer decoder for gesture synthesis based on multimodal inputs [12] or integrating attention within a diffusion model [2]. While these sequence-to-sequence models excel at learning complex mappings, typical end-to-end systems based purely on these architectures may sometimes struggle to effectively capture the fine-grained rhythm and subtle temporal harmony between input speech/text and generated gestures. This limitation has led some research to move beyond standard sequence-to-sequence models by incorporating explicit mechanisms or pipelines, such as a "Rhythm-based Normalized Pipeline", to specifically address and ensure the temporal coherence, highlighting that architectural design and supplementary modules significantly impact gesture quality and synchronization [6].​  

# 4.2 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)  

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) represent a significant paradigm in generative modeling, characterized by an adversarial training process involving a generator and a discriminator network. This adversarial setup allows GANs to potentially generate highly realistic and diverse synthetic data, making them a compelling approach for complex data generation tasks such as co-speech gesture synthesis. The generator aims to produce data samples that are indistinguishable from real data, while the discriminator learns to differentiate between real and generated samples. This dynamic interplay encourages the generator to capture the underlying data distribution effectively.  

Specific implementations of adversarial components have been explored in multimodal generation contexts relevant to gesture synthesis. For instance, an adversarial network, conceptualized as a fader network, has been utilized for disentangling style and content information within multimodal data streams [12]. In this architecture, a discriminator is trained to predict the style embedding $\{ h _ { \it { s t y l e } } \}$ based on the content embedding ( $\left( h _ { c o n t e n t } \right)$ , formulated as  

$$
h _ { s t y l e } = \mathrm { D i s } ( h _ { c o n t e n t } )
$$  

[12]. Concurrently, the auto-encoder component is optimized using an additional adversarial loss. This loss is designed such that the style classifier is unable to predict the style embedding from the content, thereby encouraging disentanglement. The adversarial loss can be expressed using a formulation like:​  

$$
\begin{array} { r l } { \int _ { \small a d v g e n } ( E _ { c o n t e n t } , E _ { s t y l e } , G ) = } & { { } \mathbb { E } _ { h _ { s t y l e } } \left. 1 - \left( h _ { s t y l e } - \mathrm { D i s } ( h _ { c o n t e n t } ) \right) \right. ^ { 2 } } \end{array}
$$  

This approach demonstrates how adversarial loss functions can be specifically crafted to achieve desired properties in the generated output, such as feature disentanglement, which is pertinent for controlling aspects like gesture style  

independently of semantic content [12]. More broadly, adversarial loss functions in GANs are typically designed to ensure that the generated data accurately resembles the distribution and characteristics of the original data [20].  

Despite their generative potential, GANs are known to present significant challenges during training. Issues such as mode collapse, where the generator produces only a limited variety of samples, and training instability are common [20]. These challenges necessitate extensive investigation and pose urgent research problems [20]. While the provided digests highlight the existence of these difficulties [20], they do not detail specific techniques developed within the gesture generation domain to mitigate mode collapse or instability.  

Beyond core generative tasks, GANs have found specific applications and considerations in related data domains, including privacy-preserving data publishing [20]. This application leverages GANs to generate synthetic datasets that retain the statistical properties essential for research and analysis while simultaneously protecting the privacy of individuals within the original data [20]. The architecture involves generators and discriminators tailored for this purpose [20]. Examples of this application include Seed Free Graph De-anonymization, Privacy Graph Embedding Data Publication, and the use of GANs in sensitive areas like data for auto-driving vehicles [20]. This demonstrates the versatility of GANs in data-related tasks beyond direct data synthesis, extending to data management, knowledge discovery, and information fusion, albeit with recognized privacy challenges [20].​  

# 4.3 Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)  

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been employed in data-driven co-speech gesture generation to model the underlying distribution of gesture data, thereby facilitating the generation of diverse and naturalistic motions. The VAE architecture typically consists of an encoder that maps input gesture sequences to a latent space, and a decoder that reconstructs gestures from samples drawn from this latent space. A key advantage of VAEs is their ability to learn a structured latent representation, which represents a probabilistic distribution rather than a fixed point, unlike traditional autoencoders. Sampling from this learned distribution allows for the generation of variations of gestures, contributing to diversity in the output. Furthermore, this structured latent space offers potential avenues for controlling the characteristics of generated gestures by manipulating the latent variables. Different VAE variants and regularization techniques can influence the quality and controllability of the generated output. For instance, conditioning the VAE on additional inputs allows for targeted control over specific aspects of the gesture. One study utilized an emotion-conditioned VAE to incorporate emotional expressiveness into the generated gestures [3]. By sampling emotion-specific features within the latent space, this approach enabled the generation of diverse gestures reflecting various emotional states and provided explicit control over the emotional tone of the generated output [3]. This demonstrates how conditioning and tailoring the VAE architecture can enhance both the diversity and controllability of the gesture generation process by structuring the latent space based on desired attributes.​  

# 4.4 Diffusion Models and Flow-Based Models  

Recent advancements in generative modeling have seen Diffusion Models (DMs) and Flow‐Based Models emerge as powerful alternatives to traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for complex data synthesis. These models offer distinct theoretical frameworks, often rooted in likelihood‐based or score‐ matching approaches, which can contribute to greater training stability and improved sample quality compared to adversarial methods, while providing more direct density estimation than VAEs. Their application to co‐speech gesture generation has shown promise in producing high‐fidelity and diverse motion sequences.​  

Diffusion models operate by learning to reverse a gradual diffusion process that transforms data into noise, effectively synthesizing data by denoising a random input. This framework has been applied to gesture generation to produce high fidelity, audio‐aligned gestures by formally defining the diffusion and denoising processes within the gesture space [2]. Techniques within this paradigm involve integrating latent motion features to achieve more precise and nuanced gesture representations [9]. Specific architectural components, such as a Diffusion Audio–Gesture Transformer and a Diffusion Gesture Stabilizer, have been employed to facilitate this process [2].​  

Furthermore, the inherent properties of diffusion models—particularly their invertible nature during the denoising process— enable advanced capabilities like multi‐level editing of generated gestures without requiring model retraining [19]. This is achieved through diffusion inversion, which allows reconstructing intermediate noise from existing gestures and subsequently regenerating new gestures with modifications [19].  

A critical challenge in sequential data generation, including gestures, is maintaining temporal consistency. Diffusion models, which often generate data frame by frame or rely on noise sampled per timestep, need specific mechanisms to ensure smooth and coherent motion over time. One approach leverages techniques like thresholding and smooth sampling [2]. Thresholding sets a time threshold $t _ { 0 }$ ​ , using independent Gaussian noise $z$ for each time step $t < t _ { 0 }$ ​ but employing the same noise $z _ { 0 }$ ​ for all frames at $t \leq t _ { 0 }$ ​ to ensure no change across the time dimension in later stages of the reverse process [2]. Smooth sampling generates a single noise $z _ { 0 } \left( t \right)$ for each time step $t$ from  

$$
{ \cal N } \big ( 0 , \sigma _ { a } ( t ) ^ { 2 } I \big )
$$  

in the reverse process, then generates a conditional noise $z _ { i } ( t )$ for each frame $\mathbf { \chi } _ { i }$ from  

$$
{ \cal N } \big ( z _ { 0 } ( t ) , \big ( 1 - \sigma _ { a } ( t ) ^ { 2 } \big ) I \big ) ,
$$  

where $\sigma _ { a } ( t )$ is a non‐decreasing variance annealing function [2]. These methods explicitly address the potential for temporal incoherence stemming from independent noise sampling across time.  

Flow‐Based Models, including variants like Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), offer another powerful generative framework. These models define an invertible mapping between a simple base distribution (such as Gaussian noise) and the complex data distribution. Optimal‐Transport Conditional Flow Matching (OT–CFM) has been successfully applied to unified speech and gesture synthesis [1]. A notable advantage highlighted for this approach is its efficiency; it achieves better synthesis quality in significantly fewer steps compared to prior methods [1].​  

In comparison to GANs and VAEs, Diffusion Models and Flow‐Based Models provide alternative probabilistic modeling paradigms. Although the theoretical distinctions are not extensively detailed, the results indicate practical benefits such as potentially more stable training (a common advantage for likelihood/score‐based models compared to GANs) and improved synthesis quality [1]. The efficiency gains demonstrated by OT–CFM [1], coupled with the high fidelity and controllability afforded by diffusion models [2,9,19], position these frameworks as promising avenues for advancing the state of the art in data‐driven co‐speech gesture generation.​  

# 5. Incorporating Expressiveness and Style  

Generating co-speech gestures that exhibit natural expressiveness, encompassing variations in emotion, rhythm, and individual style, is a critical aspect of creating believable virtual agents and robots. Approaches to enhancing expressiveness often focus on extracting and integrating relevant features from input modalities, primarily speech audio and associated data. One method to model the correlation between emotion and audio beat involves an Emotion‐Beat Mining (EBM) module [3]. This module extracts emotion and audio beat features from speech and employs a transcript‐based visual‐ rhythm alignment to capture their relationship [3]. Furthermore, diverse emotional outputs can be enabled by utilizing an emotion‐conditioned Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to sample emotion features [3].  

Beyond generating gestures for a single emotional state, handling transitions between different emotions is crucial for fluid and natural expressiveness. Techniques utilizing weakly supervised learning have been explored for this purpose [4]. One such approach models the temporal association representation between distinct emotional gesture sequences, using this as style guidance during the generation of transition gestures [4]. An emotion mixture mechanism further refines this process by providing weak supervision based on a learnable mixed emotion label specifically for the transition segments [4].  

In addition to emotion and rhythm, incorporating individual speaker style and enabling personalization are significant challenges. Style transfer methods aim to imbue the generated gestures with the characteristics of a target speaker.

A speaker style encoder network can learn a fixed-dimensional style embedding from a target speaker's multimodal data, including 2D poses, BERT embeddings derived from text, and Mel spectrograms from speech [12]. This style encoder processes inputs such as the Mel spectrogram $X _ { s p e e c h }$ ​ , BERT embedding $X _ { t e x t }$ ​ , and a sequence of 2D joint positions $X _ { p o s e }$ [12]. The resulting style embedding $h _ { s t y l e }$ ​ can be computed as:​  

$$
h _ { s t y l e } = s a ( A S T ( X _ { s p e e c h } ) , E _ { p o s e } ( X _ { p o s e } ) )
$$  

[12].​  

This embedding is subsequently used to condition the gesture generation process. Other methods allow for more explicit control over specific gesture characteristics, enabling a degree of personalization. This can involve adding control signals to the generation process to manipulate attributes such as hand height, gesture speed, and hand radius [6]. Such control mechanisms demonstrate a capability to edit and personalize generated gestures beyond basic alignment with speech content, offering granular control over certain style dimensions [6].​  

While significant progress has been made in incorporating emotion, rhythm, and style, the disentanglement of content and style, as well as comprehensive evaluation methodologies for diverse style control mechanisms, remain active areas of research.  

# 6. Evaluation Metrics and Methodologies  

Evaluating the quality of generated co-speech gestures is a critical challenge in the field, requiring robust quantitative and qualitative assessment methods. Effective evaluation necessitates employing a combination of objective metrics and subjective human perception studies to capture the multifaceted nature of gesture quality.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Metric/Category</td><td>Purpose/Focus</td><td>Key Aspect Measured</td><td>Description/Example</td></tr><tr><td>Fréchet Gesture Distance (FGD)</td><td>Distribution Similarity</td><td>Overall realism, Naturalness compared to real data</td><td>Compares feature distributions (mean, cov)</td></tr><tr><td>Beat Consistency (BC)</td><td>Temporal Alignment</td><td>Correlation of gesture timing with audio rhythm</td><td>Measures alignment of motion peaks to audio beats</td></tr><tr><td>Diversity</td><td>Output Variation</td><td>Range and non- repetitiveness of generated gestures</td><td>Assesses variety for different inputs</td></tr><tr><td>Kinematic/Dynamics</td><td>Movement Properties/Style</td><td>Expressivity, Energy, Flow</td><td>Acceleration, Jerk, Velocity, Bounding Box</td></tr><tr><td>Distance Metrics</td><td>Similarity to Target</td><td>Accuracy vs. reference behavior</td><td>E.g., Distavg(x,Target)</td></tr><tr><td>Pose Error (e.g., MPJPE)</td><td>Spatial Accuracy</td><td>Accuracy of joint positions</td><td>Error between generated and ground truth poses</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Objective evaluation metrics provide quantitative measures for aspects of gesture generation, facilitating reproducibility and comparison across different models. Various objective metrics have been proposed and utilized. The Fréchet Gesture Distance (FGD), for instance, quantifies the difference in data distribution between generated and real gesture sequences [2]. Similar in principle to the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) used in image generation [19], FGD typically involves training a gesture sequence autoencoder to extract features from real $( X )$ and generated $( { \hat { X } } )$ sequences [2]. The distance is then calculated based on the first and second-order moments (mean $\mu$ and covariance $\Sigma$ ) of these feature distributions using the formula:​  

$$
\begin{array} { r } { F G D ( \boldsymbol { X } , \hat { \boldsymbol { X } } ) = \Vert \mu _ { r } - \mu _ { g } \Vert ^ { 2 } + \mathrm { T r } \Big ( \Sigma _ { r } + \Sigma _ { g } - 2 \sqrt { \Sigma _ { r } \Sigma _ { g } } \Big ) } \end{array}
$$  

[2].​  

This metric aims to capture the overall realism and naturalness of the generated gesture distribution compared to the ground truth.  

Another crucial aspect is the temporal relationship between generated gestures and the accompanying audio. The Beat Consistency Score (BC) measures the correlation between motion and audio rhythm [2]. It evaluates how well gesture timing aligns with salient audio events or rhythmic cues, often involving analysis of angle change rates relative to typical movement speeds [2]. The BC can be calculated based on the temporal proximity of motion peaks to audio beats [2].​  

Diversity is another important objective metric, assessing the degree of variation in gestures generated for different inputs [2]. High diversity indicates a model's ability to produce varied and non-repetitive movements, a key characteristic of natural human gesturing.  

Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distav g(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Tar get)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Dis tavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x, Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target)Distavg(x,Target) stavg(x,Target)\`, are also used to quantify similarity to target behaviors [12]. While not explicitly detailed in the provided digests with a specific formula, pose error metrics (e.g., mean per joint position error) are standard objective measures that assess the spatial accuracy of generated joint positions compared to a reference, particularly relevant in tasks involving reconstruction or direct imitation.  

The strengths of objective metrics lie in their quantitative nature, enabling systematic comparison and tracking progress. However, a significant challenge in the field is the lack of widely accepted, standardized evaluation protocols, making direct comparison across different research efforts difficult [8]. More critically, objective metrics, while useful, may not fully capture the subjective qualities of gestures that are essential for human communication, such as naturalness, appropriateness for the context, and expressiveness.  

This highlights the crucial role of human perception and subjective evaluation in assessing gesture quality [1,7]. Subjective evaluation typically involves conducting user studies where human participants rate generated gestures based on criteria like human-likeness, naturalness, appropriateness, and synchronization. These studies can take various forms, including uni-modal evaluations focusing solely on the visual gesture sequence or multi-modal evaluations considering the gesture in conjunction with the corresponding speech [1]. Methodologies involve showing participants generated content alongside real motion or outputs from baseline models and collecting ratings or preferences through questionnaires or paired comparisons. Challenges in conducting subjective studies include the significant time and resource investment required, potential variability in human judgment, and the difficulty in designing unbiased evaluation protocols that yield statistically significant results.​  

A key area of research is the correlation between objective metrics and subjective human perception. The goal is to develop objective measures that reliably predict human judgments of gesture quality. Metrics like MotionCritic have been proposed specifically to align with human perceptual preferences for motion quality [7]. Studies indicate that MotionCritic shows strong performance against other motion evaluation metrics and high alignment with human ratings in datasets like MotionPercept and HumanAct12 [7]. Achieving state-of-the-art results in gesture generation often requires validation using both objective and subjective evaluation methods, confirming that quantitative improvements translate to perceptually better gestures [6].​  

Despite the existing metrics and methodologies, significant limitations remain. The lack of standardization hinders consistent comparisons [8]. Furthermore, current metrics may not fully capture complex aspects like context-dependent appropriateness, cultural nuances, or the subtle expressive qualities of gestures. There is a continuous need for the development of new, more comprehensive and robust evaluation metrics that can better capture the multifaceted nature of co-speech gestures, including naturalness, expressiveness, and sophisticated synchronization with speech and semantic content [17]. Future work should focus on creating metrics that not only correlate strongly with human perception but also evaluate gestures in richer, more contextualized scenarios.  

# 7. Applications

The generation of co-speech gestures serves a diverse array of applications, each imposing distinct requirements on the synthesis process. These applications span various domains, including interactive systems, entertainment media production, and potentially educational platforms, where communicative nonverbal behavior can significantly enhance user experience and communication effectiveness.​  

In the realm of interactive applications—such as human-robot interaction (HRI), human-machine interaction (HMI), virtual assistants, and embodied conversational agents—the primary requirement for co-speech gesture generation is often realtime performance [1,10,12,14]. In these scenarios, gestures must be generated synchronously with speech to ensure natural and fluid communication. Co-speech gestures in HRI, for instance, contribute to more intuitive and effective collaboration by providing supplementary visual cues that complement verbal commands or information [10,14]. While some research in this area focuses on understanding or recognizing human gestures in HRI [8,10,16], the ability to generate appropriate cospeech gestures allows robots or virtual agents to appear more approachable and to convey intent and state more clearly, improving the overall interaction quality [3,4,7]. Applications in HRI include collaborative robots, assistive mobile robots, and even more complex systems like robotic exoskeletons or prostheses, where natural communication is paramount [10].  

For entertainment and media production—such as video games, film, virtual social spaces, and virtual avatar animation— the emphasis shifts towards expressiveness, realism, and diversity [3,4,5,6,7,9,11]. Applications in these domains require gestures that are not only synchronized with speech but also convey appropriate emotions, personality, and stylistic variations to bring characters to life [3,4,12]. The goal is to achieve highly realistic and contextually relevant nonverbal behavior from speech and text inputs [6]. This includes generating vivid, diverse, and emotional 3D co-speech gestures crucial for engaging and believable virtual avatar animation and realistic video production [3,4,9]. The autonomous control of verbal and nonverbal behaviors of virtual characters is highly valuable in these contexts [11]. Research efforts include developing systems that can generate gestures with specific styles or roles [6,12], contributing to more personalized and immersive experiences.​  

While not explicitly detailed in the provided digests as a separate category, the requirement for clarity is implicitly relevant across many applications, particularly where complex information is conveyed—such as in educational contexts or taskoriented interactions. Communicative gestures, inherently aimed at complementing verbal content, can aid in explaining concepts, highlighting key points, and maintaining audience attention, thereby enhancing the clarity and effectiveness of communication [10,11].​  

In summary, different applications of co-speech gesture generation prioritize distinct requirements: real-time synthesis for interactive systems like HRI and virtual agents; expressiveness, realism, and stylistic control for entertainment and virtual media; and clarity to improve communication effectiveness across various domains [1,3,4,10,12]. The ability to generate contextually appropriate and natural-looking gestures significantly enhances the naturalness, engagement, and overall quality of human interaction with artificial agents and digital characters [7].​  

# 8. Challenges and Future Directions  

The field of data-driven co-speech gesture generation faces several significant challenges that limit the realism, expressiveness, and controllability of current models. A primary difficulty stems from the inherent nature of human cospeech gesture, which is often idiosyncratic, non-periodic, and serves a wide diversity of communicative functions [5]. This complexity makes the task of generating natural and contextually appropriate gestures inherently difficult.  

One major hurdle is the scarcity and limitations of available data. There is a notable lack of large-scale datasets, particularly those capturing nuanced aspects like emotional transitions and corresponding 3D human gestures [4]. Annotating realistic 3D poses for such data is also challenging [4]. Furthermore, existing datasets may suffer from jittering effects or noise, leading to unstable generated gestures [3]. The high variability in how people perform gestures and the influence of cultural differences also necessitate diverse training data to ensure model accuracy and stability [8].  

Modeling the intricate relationship between speech and gestures presents considerable difficulties. This involves identifying a common underlying representation, extracting relevant semantic elements from speech, associating these elements with specific gesture characteristics, and ensuring alignment between gestures and the spoken content [11]. The weak correlation and inherent ambiguity between language and gesture further complicate this task [6]. Current models also struggle with ensuring temporal consistency and smooth transitions in generated gestures, particularly over long sequences or during changes in emotional state [6].  

Beyond data and core modeling, other challenges include achieving robustness and generalizability across different speakers and styles [2,12]. Privacy concerns are also significant, especially when utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs) which require extensive research to address effectively [20]. Real-time application is hampered by the computational cost of some models, such as flow-based approaches [1]. Critically, accurately evaluating the quality of generated motion and aligning it with human perception poses a major unresolved issue, as existing evaluation methods may not fully capture the naturalness and appropriateness of gestures [7,8].  

A more fundamental challenge lies in the incomplete understanding of gesture processing itself. Research indicates unresolved questions about whether brain responses to gestures are driven purely by action recognition or by communicative meaning, and how gesture meaning compares to language meaning [15]. The lack of a typical response profile for gestures underscores the complexity of this modality [15]. Addressing these questions requires understanding the crucial role of context, both in research design and as a principle of brain function, and necessitates more naturalistic experimental conditions accounting for diverse information sources [15].  

Overcoming these challenges opens promising avenues for future research. Exploring novel generative models, such as refining diffusion models for improved robustness and generalizability [2], or optimizing flow-based models for efficiency [1], is essential. Developing better techniques for data augmentation, synthesis, and handling noisy data, perhaps through refined weakly supervised training strategies [4,9], could mitigate data limitations. Significant focus is needed on improving personalization and generalization methods, including advancing zero-shot style transfer capabilities [12].  

Future directions should heavily incorporate deeper understanding from linguistic and psychological studies [3,15], explicitly modeling the correspondence between language and gestures in terms of rhythm and semantics [6] and modeling correlations between emotive responses and emotional states [10]. Developing more sophisticated methods for modeling and synthesizing emotion transitions is also crucial [4]. Furthermore, future work must address privacy concerns in generative models [20] and refine evaluation metrics, potentially integrating human perceptual feedback [7]. Incorporating data from multiple sensing sources and advanced machine learning techniques could also enhance accuracy [14,18].  

Addressing these challenges necessitates interdisciplinary research, drawing insights from computer science, linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, and robotics [10]. Successfully overcoming these hurdles has the potential for significant longterm impact, enabling more natural and effective human-computer and human-robot interaction [10], enhancing virtual avatars, and contributing to a deeper understanding of human communication itself.​  

# 9. Conclusion  

This survey has reviewed the significant progress in the field of data-driven co-speech gesture generation, highlighting its growing importance for creating more natural and expressive virtual characters and interactive systems [5,10]. Driven by the increasing availability of large datasets and advancements in deep generative models, the field has explored diverse methodologies [5].​  

Key advancements include the application of diffusion models to generate high-fidelity and temporally consistent gestures, demonstrating improvements in video quality and gesture diversity compared to earlier methods like GANs [2,9]. Transformer architectures have been leveraged for tasks such as zero-shot multimodal style transfer, enabling the generation of gestures in the style of unseen speakers by disentangling style encoding from different modalities [12]. Novel approaches have also focused on incorporating specific communicative aspects, such as explicitly modeling the correspondence between language and gesture rhythm and semantics [6,11]. Furthermore, research has addressed the  

crucial aspect of emotion, developing frameworks that generate emotional gestures and model emotion transitions to enhance realism and expressiveness [3,4]. Methods for unified speech and gesture synthesis using techniques like OT-CFM have shown promise in improving naturalness and cross-modal appropriateness [1].  

Despite these advancements, several challenges persist. Generating gestures that are consistently high in fidelity, temporally coherent, and appropriately synchronized with speech remains a significant hurdle [2]. Capturing and transferring complex, nuanced styles and emotions, particularly in zero-shot scenarios or during transitions, requires further investigation [4,12]. The lack of a comprehensive understanding of the neural basis of gesture processing and how the brain integrates manual and symbolic information poses a fundamental challenge for creating truly human-like gesture systems [15]. Moreover, objective and subjective evaluation metrics that align closely with human perception are crucial for assessing and improving generation quality, necessitating metrics like MotionCritic [7]. The dependence on large datasets highlights the need for continued data collection and the development of robust benchmarks and resources to track progress and drive innovation [5,17].​  

Continued research in data-driven co-speech gesture generation holds immense potential. It can significantly enhance the realism and engagement of virtual avatars and characters in various applications, including entertainment, education, and telepresence [4]. Advancements in this field are also critical for developing more intuitive and natural Human-Robot Interaction, enabling robots to communicate more expressively [10,14]. Ultimately, by modeling and generating co-speech gestures, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of human multimodal communication, bridging insights from computer science, linguistics, and cognitive science [11,15]. The exploration of these multimodal relationships also offers potential for generalization to other multimodal generation tasks [6].
