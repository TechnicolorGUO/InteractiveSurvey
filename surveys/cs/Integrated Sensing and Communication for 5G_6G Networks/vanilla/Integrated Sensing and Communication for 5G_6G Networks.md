# Literature Survey on Integrated Sensing and Communication for 5G/6G Networks

## Introduction
The convergence of communication and sensing technologies has emerged as a pivotal paradigm in the evolution of wireless networks, particularly in the context of 5G and beyond (6G). Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) leverages shared hardware and spectrum resources to simultaneously perform communication and sensing tasks. This survey explores the foundational principles, key challenges, recent advancements, and future directions of ISAC systems.

## Background and Motivation
Traditional wireless systems have treated communication and sensing as separate domains. However, with the increasing demand for high spectral efficiency and real-time situational awareness, integrating these functionalities offers significant advantages. The shared infrastructure reduces hardware costs and energy consumption while enabling new applications such as autonomous driving, smart cities, and industrial automation.

### Key Concepts
- **Waveform Design**: A unified waveform is essential for ISAC systems. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and its variants are commonly used due to their flexibility.
- **Spectrum Sharing**: Efficient allocation of spectrum between communication and sensing is critical. Techniques like dynamic spectrum access and interference management play a vital role.

$$	ext{Spectral Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Data Rate}}{\text{Bandwidth}}$$

## Main Sections

### 1. Architectures for ISAC Systems
This section discusses various architectures proposed for ISAC systems, including coexistence, integration, and fusion models.

#### Coexistence Model
In the coexistence model, communication and sensing operate independently but share the same spectrum. This approach minimizes cross-domain interference but limits potential synergies.

#### Integration Model
The integration model involves designing waveforms that can serve both communication and sensing purposes. For example, radar signals can be modulated with communication data.

#### Fusion Model
The fusion model combines information from both domains at higher layers, such as decision-making or application levels. This approach maximizes the benefits of ISAC but requires advanced signal processing techniques.

### 2. Waveform Design and Optimization
Waveform design is a cornerstone of ISAC systems. Key considerations include:

- **Ambiguity Function**: The ambiguity function characterizes the trade-off between range and velocity resolution. Mathematically, it is defined as:
  $$A(\tau, f_d) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(t)s^*(t+\tau)e^{-j2\pi f_d t} dt$$
- **Orthogonality**: Ensuring orthogonality among subcarriers in OFDM-based systems is crucial for minimizing inter-carrier interference.

| Waveform Type | Advantages | Challenges |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| OFDM         | High spectral efficiency | Sensitive to phase noise |
| Single Carrier | Low complexity | Limited multipath resistance |

### 3. Resource Allocation and Management
Efficient resource allocation is essential for balancing the demands of communication and sensing. Techniques such as:

- **Power Allocation**: Distributing transmit power between communication and sensing streams.
- **Channel Access**: Prioritizing channels based on quality and latency requirements.

$$P_c + P_s \leq P_{\text{total}}$$
where $P_c$ and $P_s$ represent the powers allocated to communication and sensing, respectively.

### 4. Applications and Use Cases
ISAC finds applications in diverse domains, including:

- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Real-time object detection and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication.
- **Smart Cities**: Monitoring traffic flow and environmental conditions.
- **Healthcare**: Non-invasive patient monitoring using millimeter-wave sensing.

### 5. Challenges and Open Issues
Despite its promise, ISAC faces several challenges:

- **Interference Management**: Minimizing mutual interference between communication and sensing.
- **Complexity**: Advanced signal processing algorithms increase computational demands.
- **Standardization**: Lack of unified standards hinders widespread adoption.

## Conclusion
Integrated Sensing and Communication represents a transformative shift in wireless network design, offering unprecedented capabilities for 5G and 6G systems. By addressing the challenges outlined in this survey and leveraging cutting-edge research, ISAC systems can unlock new possibilities for connectivity and intelligence in the digital age.

## Future Directions
Future work should focus on:

- Developing novel waveforms tailored for ISAC.
- Enhancing machine learning-based approaches for joint optimization.
- Establishing industry-wide standards for interoperability.
