### 1.1 Definition and Evolution of ISAC

Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) represents a paradigm shift in wireless system design, transitioning from separate communication and sensing architectures to a unified framework that leverages shared resources such as spectrum, hardware, and infrastructure. ISAC has emerged as a cornerstone for next-generation wireless networks like 5G-Advanced (5G-A) and 6G, offering significant improvements in spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and cost reduction [1]. This subsection explores the definition of ISAC, its evolution from standalone systems to a converged framework, and its relevance within the context of 5G/6G networks.

At its core, ISAC integrates radar-like sensing capabilities with traditional wireless communication functionalities into a single system. By enabling the same signal to serve both purposes simultaneously, ISAC overcomes the inefficiencies of dedicated spectrum allocations for either task. Historically, communication and sensing have been treated as independent disciplines due to their differing objectives, performance metrics, and design methodologies. Communication systems focus on reliable data exchange between devices, while sensing emphasizes detecting and tracking objects in the environment. However, advances in technologies such as massive MIMO, millimeter-wave communications, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have made it feasible to merge these domains into a cohesive architecture [2].

The origins of ISAC can be traced back to the early days of wireless communications when radar and communication systems operated separately using distinct frequency bands. As demand for spectrum grew, so did the need for more efficient resource utilization. Initial approaches to coexistence included time-sharing or frequency-sharing methods, allocating different parts of the spectrum for communication and sensing tasks. While these methods improved efficiency to some extent, they fell short of fully exploiting the potential gains achievable through deeper integration [3].

With the advent of fifth-generation (5G) networks, the foundation was laid for realizing true ISAC systems. Key enabling technologies such as beamforming, network densification, and ultra-dense small cell deployments supported enhanced sensing alongside robust communication services [4]. For instance, massive MIMO arrays provide high angular resolution for precise localization in dense urban environments. Similarly, millimeter-wave bands offer abundant bandwidth necessary for fine-grained sensing accuracy. These advancements catalyzed the development of practical ISAC solutions tailored for real-world applications.

### 1.3 Foundational Principles of ISAC

The foundational principles of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems revolve around the shared use of spectrum, hardware platforms, and advanced system architectures, all aimed at achieving efficient operations in 5G/6G networks. A key concept is spectrum sharing, where the same frequency bands are utilized for both communication and sensing functions [5]. This approach leverages the electromagnetic spectrum more effectively compared to traditional methods that separate these functionalities into distinct bands, thereby reducing spectral congestion while enhancing overall efficiency.

Another cornerstone principle is the joint use of hardware platforms. ISAC integrates sensing and communication functions on a single platform, minimizing hardware costs and improving energy efficiency by consolidating resources [17]. For instance, base stations in cellular networks can be transformed into powerful sensors capable of providing high-resolution localization services [18], ensuring seamless performance for both communication and sensing tasks.

System architecture design plays a critical role in optimizing ISAC operations. Various architectures have been proposed to address different requirements and constraints. Monostatic architectures involve using the same base station (BS) for transmitting and receiving signals, which simplifies deployment but may introduce self-interference issues [19]. To mitigate this limitation, multistatic architectures employ multiple BSs to spatially separate transmission and reception processes, thereby reducing interference [19]. Cooperative designs further enhance performance by enabling collaboration among multiple nodes to improve target detection accuracy and localization precision [20].

Waveform design is another crucial aspect of ISAC system architecture. Effective waveforms must balance the needs of both communication and sensing while addressing challenges such as mutual interference and spectrum sharing [21]. Recent studies focus on developing innovative waveform techniques tailored specifically for ISAC applications. For example, index modulation has been explored as a means to incorporate information-bearing communication symbols into emitted radar waveforms [22], achieving improved energy and spectral efficiency while maintaining satisfactory radar sensing performance.

Interference management constitutes an integral part of ISAC foundational principles due to its potential impact on system performance. Self-interference, mutual interference, and clutter pose significant challenges that necessitate effective mitigation strategies [16]. Techniques such as interference suppression, avoidance, and exploitation have been developed to tackle these issues. Additionally, cooperative interference management methods are employed to address cross-link interference in coordinated multipoint ISAC systems [16]. By carefully designing and implementing these techniques, ISAC systems can achieve optimal performance levels.

Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), also known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), represent an emerging technology with great potential for enhancing ISAC capabilities [2]. IRSs manipulate the propagation environment in an energy-efficient manner, offering benefits such as extended coverage and enhanced signal quality. They can be deployed either as standalone entities placed between transmitters and receivers or integrated directly into ISAC transmitters [2]. The inclusion of IRSs within ISAC frameworks provides opportunities for achieving superior performance across various scenarios.

Standardization efforts play a vital role in advancing ISAC technologies toward practical implementation. Global standardization bodies like the International Telecommunication Union's Radio communication sector (ITU-R) have recognized ISAC as a key usage scenario for IMT-2030/6G networks [1]. These initiatives aim to establish common frameworks, metrics, and protocols that facilitate interoperability and seamless integration of ISAC functionalities into existing wireless communication systems. Addressing challenges related to standardization will pave the way for widespread adoption of ISAC solutions in diverse application domains.

In conclusion, the foundational principles of ISAC encompass spectrum sharing, joint use of hardware platforms, advanced system architecture design, waveform innovation, interference management, and intelligent surface utilization. Together, these principles form the basis for developing efficient ISAC systems that meet the demands of 5G/6G networks. As research progresses, continued exploration and refinement of these principles will drive further advancements in ISAC technology, ultimately leading to transformative applications across various industries.

### 1.4 System Architecture Overview

System architecture plays a pivotal role in defining the operational framework and performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The design choices for ISAC architectures are driven by considerations such as spectral efficiency, hardware constraints, and application requirements. In this subsection, we provide an overview of different ISAC architectures, including monostatic, multistatic, and cooperative designs, highlighting their unique advantages and trade-offs that make them suitable for specific use cases in 5G/6G networks.

### Monostatic Architecture

Monostatic ISAC architecture employs the same base station (BS) to transmit signals and receive echoes, enabling efficient spectrum sharing between sensing and communication functionalities. This architecture leverages existing cellular infrastructure and is straightforward to implement. However, it faces challenges due to self-interference (SI), where the transmitted signal interferes with the received radar echo at the BS [19]. To mitigate SI, sophisticated signal processing techniques and advanced beamforming designs have been proposed [23]. While monostatic ISAC achieves high spectral efficiency and reduces hardware costs, it suffers from limited degrees of freedom (DoFs) due to single observation angles and potential blockage of transmission links [24]. Optimizing transmit power allocation becomes critical to balance communication rate and sensing performance, especially when dealing with non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths [24].

Despite these limitations, monostatic ISAC remains a promising architecture for applications requiring localized sensing and communication services, such as autonomous driving and smart city infrastructure management. It provides a unified platform for both functionalities, reducing the need for separate hardware components and enhancing energy efficiency [25].

### Multistatic Architecture

Multistatic ISAC architecture extends beyond monostatic configurations by employing multiple transmitters and receivers spatially distributed across a network. This setup inherently circumvents the SI issues present in monostatic systems by spatially separating signal transmission and reception [19]. Furthermore, multistatic ISAC improves target localization accuracy through diverse observation angles, making it well-suited for wide-area coverage scenarios. For instance, in cellular networks, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals transmitted from a central BS can be processed by neighboring BSs to estimate object parameters [26]. Such cooperative data processing enhances position and velocity estimation accuracy compared to monostatic or bistatic setups.

However, multistatic ISAC introduces additional complexity in terms of synchronization, coordination, and resource allocation among distributed nodes [27]. Efficient joint optimization of transmit and receive beamforming policies becomes essential to minimize sensing beam pattern mismatch errors while meeting quality-of-service (QoS) requirements [19]. Although computationally intensive, alternating optimization-based algorithms offer suboptimal solutions that outperform conventional designs [19].

### Cooperative Design

Cooperative ISAC architectures represent a paradigm shift towards network-level integration of sensing and communication services. These architectures leverage multi-point (CoMP) coordinated joint transmission and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar techniques to enhance overall system performance [20]. By deploying multiple ISAC transceivers, cooperative networks benefit from increased degrees of freedom, leading to improved average cooperative sensing performance according to the ln²N scaling law [20]. 

One significant advantage of cooperative ISAC lies in its ability to dynamically adapt to dynamic environments via AI-based continual learning methods, ensuring robustness and efficiency over time, even under imperfect channel state information (CSI). Additionally, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) play a vital role in augmenting cooperative ISAC performance by manipulating electromagnetic wave propagation characteristics [28]. Specifically, RIS-empowered communications contribute to interference management and coverage extension, addressing key challenges faced by traditional ISAC systems [29].

Nevertheless, cooperative ISAC poses several challenges, including inter-cell interference mitigation, optimal cluster size determination, and fair resource allocation among users/targets [30]. Advanced stochastic geometry tools aid in characterizing communication and sensing performance metrics, facilitating informed decision-making during network planning stages [20]. Furthermore, low-complexity heuristic algorithms enable practical implementation of BS mode selection strategies, balancing computational overhead against desired performance gains [31].

In summary, ISAC architectures encompass a range of design options catering to diverse application needs. Monostatic architectures excel in simplicity and cost-effectiveness but face limitations regarding DoFs and blockage resilience. Multistatic architectures address these shortcomings through spatial diversity at the expense of increased complexity. Lastly, cooperative ISAC architectures unlock unprecedented levels of flexibility and scalability, albeit requiring careful attention to coordination mechanisms and resource management aspects. Future research directions should focus on further refining these architectures to meet stringent QoS demands imposed by emerging 5G/6G applications. This will ultimately enhance the spectral efficiency, reduced latency, and energy efficiency benefits discussed in subsequent sections.

### 1.5 Advantages Over Traditional Systems

Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems offer several advantages over traditional separate sensing and communication systems. One of the primary benefits is the significantly higher spectral efficiency that ISAC systems provide. In traditional systems, the spectrum is allocated separately for communication and sensing tasks, leading to inefficient use of available bandwidth. By contrast, ISAC leverages a unified framework allowing both sensing and communication functions to operate on the same frequency band [32]. This shared use of the spectrum ensures more efficient utilization of limited radio resources, which is particularly crucial as we move toward 5G/6G networks where spectrum scarcity is an increasing concern.

Reduced latency is another significant advantage of ISAC systems. Traditional systems often involve independent hardware components and separate processes for data acquisition and transmission, causing increased processing delays. ISAC systems integrate these operations into a single platform [33], enabling real-time information exchange between sensors and communication nodes, thereby reducing overall system latency. For example, in autonomous driving applications where millisecond-level response times are critical, ISAC's simultaneous radar-like sensing and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications make it highly advantageous [34].

Moreover, ISAC systems exhibit improved energy efficiency compared to traditional separated systems. The joint design of communication and sensing functions allows for optimized power consumption across the entire system. This is achieved through techniques such as multi-objective optimization, which balances the trade-offs between communication and sensing performance while minimizing energy usage [35]. Additionally, technologies like intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) enhance the energy efficiency of ISAC systems by enabling passive beamforming and interference management without requiring additional active components [13].

Enhanced situational awareness is yet another key benefit of ISAC systems. By combining the capabilities of both communication and sensing subsystems, ISAC provides richer and more accurate information about the environment than either function alone. This capability is especially beneficial in scenarios like smart cities or industrial IoT, where continuous monitoring and rapid decision-making are essential [17]. Furthermore, ISAC's ability to adaptively adjust its functionality based on dynamic environmental conditions ensures effectiveness under varying operational requirements.

The synergy between communication and sensing in ISAC systems leads to performance improvements beyond those achievable by traditional approaches. For instance, ISAC can achieve better diversity gains and higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), resulting in enhanced reliability and coverage [23]. Additionally, ISAC systems can exploit mutual information (MI) as a unified metric for evaluating both sensing and communication performances, offering deeper insights into the trade-offs involved in joint operation [7]. Such an approach simplifies the design process and ensures optimal resource allocation within the system.

Another notable advantage of ISAC over traditional systems lies in its potential for multi-domain cooperation. Through collaborative architectures and advanced signal processing techniques, ISAC systems can seamlessly integrate multiple users, frequency bands, and network layers to enhance overall performance [36]. This cooperative nature addresses challenges in complex environments, such as urban settings or transportation networks, where high-resolution sensing and ultra-reliable low-latency communications are required.

Finally, ISAC offers cost savings due to the reduced need for separate hardware infrastructures. Instead of deploying distinct devices for communication and sensing purposes, ISAC utilizes shared platforms, lowering capital expenditures and simplifying maintenance procedures [1]. This economic feasibility makes ISAC an attractive option for widespread deployment in various industries, including automotive, healthcare, and logistics.

In summary, ISAC surpasses traditional separated systems in terms of spectral efficiency, reduced latency, improved energy efficiency, and enhanced situational awareness. These advantages position ISAC as a cornerstone technology for future wireless communication standards, promising transformative impacts across numerous domains.

## 2 Key Enabling Technologies and Architectures

### 2.1 Multi-Objective Optimization in ISAC

Multi-objective optimization plays a pivotal role in balancing the communication and sensing performance within Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. The inherent duality of ISAC, where both functionalities share the same spectrum and hardware resources, necessitates an intricate balance to ensure neither functionality compromises the other significantly. Achieving optimal trade-offs between communication and sensing is a complex challenge due to conflicting objectives such as maximizing data rate for communication while maintaining high resolution and accuracy for sensing tasks. This subsection delves into the importance of multi-objective optimization techniques in addressing these challenges and highlights strategies for achieving optimal trade-offs.

The foundation of multi-objective optimization in ISAC lies in understanding the fundamental trade-offs between communication and sensing performance metrics. For instance, optimizing for high spectral efficiency in communication may lead to suboptimal performance in sensing tasks and vice versa [3]. To address this, researchers have proposed unified frameworks that leverage mutual information (MI) as a common metric to evaluate both communication and sensing performance. This approach simplifies the optimization process by reducing the complexity of handling multiple disparate metrics [7].

In practical implementations, ISAC systems often face constraints such as limited bandwidth, power, and hardware capabilities. Multi-objective optimization techniques are employed to navigate these constraints effectively. For example, Pareto-optimal solutions are sought to identify configurations that provide the best possible trade-offs under given conditions. These solutions offer a range of options from which system designers can choose based on specific application requirements [37].

Waveform design is one of the critical areas where multi-objective optimization techniques are extensively applied. The design of waveforms must cater to both communication and sensing needs simultaneously. In MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems, the optimization of waveforms involves maximizing the weighted sum of communication and sensing MI. Closed-form expressions derived for this purpose enable efficient computation and validation through Monte Carlo simulations [38]. Such approaches not only enhance the overall performance but also provide insights into how different parameters affect the system's behavior.

Another significant aspect of multi-objective optimization in ISAC is interference management. Interference arises due to the shared use of spectrum and hardware resources. Effective management requires sophisticated algorithms that can dynamically adapt to varying environmental conditions. Techniques such as alternating optimization, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and gradient-based approaches are commonly used to mitigate interference while ensuring optimal performance for both communication and sensing tasks [39]. These techniques align closely with those discussed in the following subsection on joint beamforming design.

Furthermore, the integration of intelligent reflecting/refracting surfaces (IRSs) introduces additional dimensions to the optimization problem. IRSs offer enhanced control over channel characteristics, allowing for better resource allocation and interference mitigation. Optimization strategies in this context involve determining optimal surface configurations to maximize integration gains between sensing and communication. This leads to improved coverage and performance in ISAC systems [40], further complementing the advancements in joint beamforming design.

Energy efficiency is another crucial factor considered in multi-objective optimization for ISAC systems. As energy consumption becomes a significant concern, especially in large-scale deployments, optimization techniques aim to minimize power usage without compromising on performance. Green ISAC approaches focus on achieving this balance by employing advanced signal processing techniques and adaptive resource allocation schemes [4].

Standardization efforts also play a vital role in shaping the multi-objective optimization landscape for ISAC. Global bodies like ITU-R emphasize the need for standardized frameworks that can accommodate diverse applications and industries. These frameworks must account for various factors, including spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and network scalability [1].

In conclusion, multi-objective optimization is indispensable for realizing the full potential of ISAC systems. It enables the design of systems that achieve optimal trade-offs between communication and sensing performance, overcoming the limitations imposed by shared resources. By leveraging advanced techniques and integrating emerging technologies, ISAC systems can be optimized to meet the stringent demands of future wireless networks such as B5G and 6G. Continuous research and development in this area promise innovative solutions that will drive the evolution of ISAC towards more efficient and capable systems.

### 2.2 Joint Beamforming Design for ISAC

Joint beamforming design serves as a pivotal component in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, facilitating the simultaneous optimization of both communication and sensing capabilities. By strategically designing transmission beams, ISAC systems can enhance their performance metrics relevant to each functionality while adhering to constraints such as power, hardware limitations, and spectrum sharing. The inherent non-convexity of the joint beamforming problem poses significant challenges, requiring advanced optimization techniques [2].

The significance of joint beamforming lies in its ability to address the competing demands of communication and sensing within a unified framework. In communication-focused designs, beamforming strategies typically aim to maximize data rates or minimize bit error rates. Conversely, sensing-centric approaches concentrate energy in specific directions to improve target detection and localization accuracy. In ISAC systems, these objectives must be balanced through multi-objective optimization techniques that account for trade-offs between communication and sensing performance.

Non-convex optimization problems are prevalent in joint beamforming design, necessitating alternative methodologies beyond traditional convex optimization. Techniques such as semi-definite relaxation (SDR), alternating optimization, and gradient-based approaches have been explored to approximate near-optimal solutions while maintaining computational feasibility [10]. SDR transforms non-convex problems into more tractable forms by relaxing certain constraints, enabling the use of convex optimization tools. However, the quality of relaxed solutions depends on the problem's structure and the tightness of the relaxation. While effective, SDR may result in suboptimal outcomes in some scenarios, prompting investigations into hybrid methods combining SDR with heuristic search algorithms.

Alternating optimization techniques decompose complex optimization problems into smaller subproblems, allowing independent resolution using standard algorithms. Through iterative updates of variables associated with communication and sensing components, these methods converge toward locally optimal solutions. Although computationally efficient, careful initialization is crucial to avoid convergence to poor local minima [17]. Additionally, gradient-based approaches leverage derivatives of objective functions to iteratively refine system performance. Advances in machine learning have enabled deep learning-based frameworks for approximating optimal beamformers using historical data, offering flexible alternatives to analytical methods [13].

Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) represent an emerging technology enhancing joint beamforming design in ISAC systems. IRSs consist of reconfigurable passive elements capable of manipulating electromagnetic waves, favorably shaping propagation environments for improved communication and sensing performances. Studies demonstrate increased target detection probabilities and data rates when incorporating IRSs, promoting energy-efficient operation by alleviating the burden on active transceivers [41]. Furthermore, advancements in waveform design complement joint beamforming efforts, with dual-functional waveforms exhibiting superior compatibility compared to conventional single-purpose counterparts. For example, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation proves advantageous in high-mobility vehicular ISAC applications [42].

Joint beamforming underpins the integration of sensing and communication functionalities in next-generation wireless networks. Through innovative optimization techniques and emerging technologies like IRSs, researchers continue advancing ISAC beamforming design. Future research should focus on refining existing methods and exploring new paradigms to elevate the synergy between communication and sensing, driving the evolution of transformative ISAC systems. This foundation supports subsequent developments in cooperative multi-monostatic sensing frameworks, further enhancing system performance [5].

### 2.3 Cooperative Multi-Monostatic Sensing

Cooperative multi-monostatic sensing frameworks represent a promising advancement in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, leveraging the collaboration of multiple nodes to enhance target detection and localization accuracy. Building upon the foundational principles of joint beamforming design, these frameworks integrate sensing and communication functions within a shared hardware platform, achieving superior performance compared to standalone systems. This section explores how multiple nodes collaborate in such systems and highlights the benefits this approach offers.

In cooperative multi-monostatic sensing, each node operates both as a transmitter and receiver, enabling a networked architecture that improves overall system performance. The key advantage lies in the ability of multiple nodes to share information about targets, thereby mitigating issues like shadowing and multipath fading [5]. Such collaborative operations allow for enhanced robustness against adverse environmental conditions, which is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and smart cities.

One critical aspect of cooperative multi-monostatic sensing is its exploitation of spatial diversity. By deploying multiple transceiver pairs across a geographical area, these systems gain a more comprehensive view of the environment. Spatial diversity not only enhances target detection but also improves localization accuracy by reducing ambiguities caused by reflections or occlusions [43]. For instance, in urban environments where line-of-sight (LoS) paths are often blocked, the deployment of multiple nodes ensures reliable sensing even under challenging conditions.

The effectiveness of cooperative multi-monostatic sensing relies heavily on advanced signal processing techniques. These include joint estimation of target parameters, data fusion from multiple nodes, and optimization of resource allocation. Data fusion plays a pivotal role in aggregating measurements from different nodes to form a unified picture of the scene. Advanced algorithms, such as weighted least squares and Kalman filtering, are employed to process and integrate data from multiple sources [32]. These techniques help minimize errors and uncertainties inherent in individual sensor readings, thus improving the overall reliability of the system.

Moreover, cooperative multi-monostatic sensing benefits significantly from the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). RISs provide additional degrees of freedom in controlling electromagnetic wave propagation, allowing for better coverage and interference management. In the context of ISAC, RISs can be strategically placed to redirect signals towards desired directions, thereby enhancing both communication and sensing capabilities [40]. This integration of RIS technology further underscores the potential of cooperative multi-monostatic sensing frameworks in achieving high-performance ISAC systems.

Optimizing the performance of cooperative multi-monostatic ISAC networks involves addressing several challenges. One major challenge is managing interference between nodes. Since all nodes operate within the same spectrum, self-interference and mutual interference become significant concerns. Effective interference management techniques, including suppression, avoidance, and exploitation, are essential to ensure seamless operation [16]. Another challenge pertains to synchronizing the clocks of distributed nodes. Precise time synchronization is necessary for accurate signal alignment and joint parameter estimation [37].

To overcome these challenges, researchers have proposed various solutions. For example, alternating optimization-based suboptimal algorithms have been developed to jointly optimize transmit and receive beamforming policies, minimizing the mismatch error in sensing beam patterns while satisfying quality-of-service requirements for communication [19]. Similarly, heuristic methods for base station (BS) mode selection have been introduced to enhance the degrees of freedom in cooperative ISAC networks, improving both sensing and communication performance [44].

Furthermore, the concept of distributed intelligent integrated sensing and communications (DISAC) extends the capabilities of cooperative multi-monostatic ISAC networks. DISAC introduces a semantic and goal-oriented framework that enables the transition from classical data fusion to the composition of semantically selected information [3]. This transformative approach facilitates large-scale, energy-efficient tracking of connected users and objects, leveraging the fusion of heterogeneous sensors.

Simulation studies conducted on cooperative multi-monostatic ISAC networks reveal their superior performance compared to traditional monostatic architectures. Numerical results demonstrate that deploying N ISAC transceivers leads to an enhanced average cooperative sensing performance across the entire network, following the ln²N scaling law [20]. This scaling law reflects the diminishing returns observed when increasing the number of transceivers due to path loss effects from distant base stations. Despite this limitation, cooperative multi-monostatic sensing continues to offer substantial improvements over standalone approaches.

In conclusion, cooperative multi-monostatic sensing frameworks constitute a vital component of ISAC systems, providing significant enhancements in target detection and localization accuracy. Through the collaboration of multiple nodes, these frameworks exploit spatial diversity, employ advanced signal processing techniques, and incorporate innovative technologies such as RISs. While challenges related to interference management and clock synchronization persist, ongoing research efforts aim to address these issues effectively. As 5G/6G networks continue to evolve, cooperative multi-monostatic sensing will undoubtedly play a central role in realizing the full potential of ISAC technology. This foundation sets the stage for AI-based continual learning methodologies to further optimize and adapt these systems dynamically in diverse environments.

### 2.4 AI-Based Continual Learning for ISAC

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into ISAC systems represents a pivotal advancement for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of these systems in dynamic environments. Building upon the collaborative foundations laid by cooperative multi-monostatic sensing frameworks, AI-based continual learning methods offer significant potential to adapt ISAC systems dynamically, ensuring optimal performance over time despite changing conditions [20]. Continual learning allows ISAC systems to continuously learn from new data without forgetting previously acquired knowledge, which is essential for maintaining high levels of sensing and communication accuracy amidst evolving environmental factors.

One of the primary challenges faced by ISAC systems is adapting to the variability inherent in real-world scenarios such as changes in user demand, environmental conditions, and interference patterns [16]. Traditional machine learning models often require retraining when encountering new data or conditions, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. In contrast, AI-based continual learning provides mechanisms for incremental updates, allowing ISAC systems to adjust their parameters seamlessly as new information becomes available. This capability is particularly critical in applications like autonomous driving and smart cities where rapid adaptation to changing surroundings is necessary [19].

Incorporating AI-based continual learning into ISAC frameworks involves several key aspects. Firstly, model design must account for both communication and sensing tasks simultaneously while preserving compatibility with existing hardware and software architectures [38]. Advanced deep learning techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) and neural networks are increasingly being explored to optimize dual-functional waveforms that cater to both objectives effectively [32]. For instance, RL algorithms can learn optimal policies for joint beamforming designs under varying channel states and traffic demands, thereby improving overall system throughput and target localization accuracy.

Moreover, continual learning facilitates better handling of uncertainties arising from imperfect channel state information (CSI) and noise sources prevalent in practical implementations [8]. By leveraging large datasets accumulated over extended periods, these algorithms refine estimates progressively, leading to improved resilience against measurement errors and other disturbances. Additionally, they enable efficient resource allocation strategies by predicting future usage patterns based on historical trends [33].

Another important dimension of AI-based continual learning lies in its ability to enhance security features within ISAC networks. As malicious actors exploit vulnerabilities associated with shared spectrum resources, adaptive countermeasures become indispensable [45]. Machine learning-driven anomaly detection mechanisms coupled with continual learning paradigms provide proactive identification of suspicious activities, safeguarding sensitive communications and accurate target tracking simultaneously.

Furthermore, collaborative multi-monostatic sensing frameworks benefit immensely from AI-based continual learning approaches [44]. These methods allow multiple nodes to cooperate intelligently, sharing insights derived from individual observations and jointly refining global estimations of targets’ positions, velocities, and trajectories. Such synergy not only amplifies detection capabilities but also minimizes redundant computations across distributed platforms, complementing advancements provided by technologies like RIS.

Despite the evident advantages offered by AI-based continual learning methodologies, certain limitations persist warranting further investigation. Computational complexity remains a major concern since sophisticated algorithms demand substantial processing power and memory storage capacity [46]. Efficient implementation requires careful trade-offs between performance gains achieved through enhanced modeling fidelity versus increased latency introduced due to intensive computation requirements.

Efforts towards developing lightweight yet powerful models tailored specifically for edge devices could alleviate some burdens imposed by traditional centralized architectures [47]. Federated learning emerges as another promising avenue wherein local updates performed independently at each node are aggregated periodically, reducing dependency on central servers while preserving privacy constraints.

Lastly, ethical considerations surrounding deployment of autonomous decision-making systems powered by AI necessitate thorough scrutiny prior to widespread adoption [48]. Ensuring transparency in algorithmic operations alongside robust testing procedures forms an integral part of this process.

In conclusion, AI-based continual learning holds immense promise for advancing ISAC technologies, enabling them to operate efficiently even under rapidly fluctuating circumstances characteristic of modern wireless ecosystems. Future research should focus on overcoming current barriers related to computational overheads while addressing broader societal implications tied to increased reliance on intelligent automation. This refined approach naturally transitions into waveform design considerations, as optimizing waveforms plays a crucial role in fully harnessing the potential of AI-enhanced ISAC systems.

### 2.5 RIS-Empowered Communications in ISAC

Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology for enhancing Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. By manipulating electromagnetic waves spatially, RIS offers significant advantages in terms of interference management and coverage extension, making it an essential enabler for 5G/6G networks. The fundamental principle behind RIS lies in its ability to control the phase, amplitude, or polarization of incident signals through passive elements arranged on a surface. This capability allows RIS to dynamically adapt wireless environments, thereby improving both communication and sensing performance.

In ISAC systems, where shared resources such as spectrum and hardware are leveraged for simultaneous communication and sensing tasks, RIS plays a pivotal role in mitigating mutual interference between these two functions. Interference is one of the most critical challenges in ISAC design, arising due to the coexistence of communication and radar signals within the same frequency band. Techniques like self-interference cancellation, mutual interference suppression, and clutter mitigation become more effective when combined with RIS-assisted signal manipulation [16]. For example, RIS can steer unwanted interference away from sensitive receivers while focusing useful signals toward desired targets. This selective wavefront shaping enhances system robustness against adverse propagation conditions.

Moreover, RIS extends the operational range of ISAC systems by compensating for path loss and shadow fading. Coverage enhancement is particularly crucial in scenarios involving non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communications or obstructed sensing paths. By reflecting or refracting transmitted signals towards intended users or targets, RIS ensures reliable connectivity even in challenging environments [13]. Additionally, RIS reduces the energy consumption of base stations and user equipment by minimizing transmit power requirements without compromising link quality. Such efficiency gains align well with the sustainability goals of next-generation networks.

The integration of RIS into ISAC architectures has been explored extensively in recent literature. One notable approach involves deploying RIS near target areas to improve radar detection probability and reduce estimation errors. In such setups, the reflected signals from RIS amplify the echo strength at the receiver, leading to higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Consequently, metrics like Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for ranging and velocity estimation show marked improvements compared to traditional configurations [13]. Furthermore, RIS enables multi-static sensing frameworks, allowing multiple surfaces to collaborate in tracking moving objects across extended regions [49].

Another promising avenue for RIS-empowered ISAC systems is their application in dense urban settings characterized by complex scattering environments. Here, RIS serves as a key enabler for millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) bands, which suffer from high propagation losses but offer abundant bandwidths for ultra-high-speed data transmission and fine-grained environmental monitoring. Spatial Path Index Modulation (SPIM), a novel technique introduced for mmWave THz-band ISAC systems, demonstrates how RIS can be employed not only for coverage enhancement but also for conveying additional information bits via modulated spatial paths [21]. These innovations underscore the potential of RIS to address unique challenges associated with high-frequency operation while maintaining spectral efficiency.

From a resource allocation perspective, RIS introduces new degrees of freedom that simplify joint optimization problems in ISAC systems. Traditionally, balancing communication and sensing objectives required sophisticated algorithms to allocate scarce resources effectively. However, RIS provides extra flexibility by enabling independent tuning of reflection coefficients for each element on the surface. As a result, designers can achieve better trade-offs between communication rate (CR) and sensing rate (SR) under varying channel conditions [23]. Insights gained from analyzing diversity orders and high-SNR slopes reveal that RIS-empowered designs consistently outperform conventional frequency-division S&C (FDSAC) techniques [33].

Bayesian learning approaches further enhance the effectiveness of RIS in ISAC applications, especially in scenarios requiring rapid updates of channel state information (CSI). When double-RIS structures are deployed, sparse Bayesian learning frameworks allow simultaneous localization and communication with minimal pilot overhead [50]. This advancement is particularly valuable for time-sensitive use cases such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, where low-latency and high-accuracy are paramount.

Despite these advantages, several challenges remain in fully realizing the potential of RIS-empowered ISAC systems. First, accurate modeling of RIS behavior under dynamic environmental changes remains an open problem. Second, practical implementations must account for hardware impairments, calibration errors, and synchronization issues that could degrade overall performance. Lastly, standardization efforts need to incorporate RIS-specific parameters and procedures to ensure seamless interoperability across diverse network deployments [1].

In conclusion, RIS represents a cornerstone technology for advancing ISAC capabilities in future wireless networks. Its ability to manipulate electromagnetic waves spatially addresses key limitations in interference management and coverage extension, paving the way for innovative solutions tailored to specific application domains. Continued research in this area promises to unlock unprecedented levels of spectral and energy efficiency, ultimately contributing to the vision of smart and connected societies enabled by 5G/6G technologies. This section naturally transitions into waveform design considerations, as RIS-based systems often rely on carefully designed waveforms to optimize both sensing and communication performance.

### 2.6 Waveform Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication

Waveform design for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems is critical in addressing the challenges of spectrum sharing, interference mitigation, and dual-functionality support while balancing the demands of both communication and sensing. ISAC waveforms must accommodate the often conflicting performance metrics of these two domains: communication typically prioritizes maximizing data rates or minimizing bit error rates (BER), whereas sensing focuses on enhancing target detection accuracy and localization precision [30].

Achieving an effective trade-off between sensing and communication performance remains one of the primary challenges in ISAC waveform design. This challenge arises due to the differences in their respective metrics—communication performance relies on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), achievable rate, and BER, while sensing depends on metrics such as Cramér-Rao bound (CRB), Fisher information, and detection probability [51]. To address this disparity, researchers have developed innovative waveform designs that unify these domains under a common framework.

An information-theoretic approach has gained prominence in designing waveforms for ISAC systems. Mutual information (MI) serves as a unified metric for evaluating both communication and sensing performance. By leveraging MI, it becomes possible to optimize waveforms that enhance overall system performance. For instance, a study derived upper and lower bounds for the communication and sensing MI in an uplink MIMO-OFDM ISAC system and optimized the ISAC waveform by maximizing the weighted sum of sensing and communication MI, achieving superior performance compared to other schemes [52].

Another important aspect of ISAC waveform design involves accommodating constraints imposed by multi-carrier modulation techniques. Multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) has emerged as a promising technology for ISAC systems. In these systems, subcarrier correlation and spatial correlation significantly influence both sensing and communication performance. Researchers have developed optimal waveform designs to maximize the sensing MI, communication MI, and the weighted sum of both in MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems, providing closed-form expressions that enable balanced performance [38].

Spectrum sharing represents another key challenge in ISAC waveform design, requiring efficient interference management when integrating sensing and communication functionalities into a single waveform. Techniques such as spectrum lines estimators and super-resolution methods have been explored for ISAC signals, offering insights into how spectrum can be efficiently shared between the two domains [34]. Moreover, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) enhance spectrum sharing capabilities by manipulating electromagnetic waves spatially, thereby reducing interference and improving coverage [53].

In practical scenarios, ISAC waveforms must account for finite blocklength regimes, where trade-offs between communication rate and sensing distortion become significant. Achievability and converse bounds on the rate-distortion-error tradeoff have been derived for ISAC systems operating in the finite blocklength regime, providing guidance for designing waveforms that balance communication and sensing performance under resource constraints [54].

Experimental validation is essential for assessing the feasibility of ISAC waveforms. Studies utilizing OFDM-based multi-user MIMO software-defined radio (SDR) testbeds have demonstrated that dual-functional approaches achieve comparable BER performance to pure communication-based solutions while maintaining fine radar beampatterns [55].

Finally, robustness to imperfect channel state information (CSI) is crucial in ISAC waveform design. CSI imperfections introduce uncertainties that degrade both communication and sensing performance. Decomposition-based large deviation inequality approaches have been proposed to mitigate the impact of CSI errors on communication rate and sensing CRB, ensuring stable performance even in challenging environments [56].

In conclusion, waveform design for ISAC systems addresses the multifaceted challenges of spectrum sharing, interference management, and dual-functionality support. Advances in information-theoretic approaches, multi-carrier modulation techniques, RIS-assisted enhancements, and robustness to CSI imperfections contribute to realizing efficient ISAC waveforms capable of balancing communication and sensing performance. Future research directions include exploring advanced signal processing techniques, semantic communications, and sustainable frameworks to further enhance ISAC systems.

## 3 Performance Metrics and Optimization Strategies

### 3.1 Mutual Information as a Unified Metric

Mutual information (MI) serves as a unifying performance metric for both sensing and communication in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. By quantifying the shared information between two variables, MI provides deep insights into the trade-offs between deterministic and random signals, which are integral to ISAC operations [7]. This unified framework enables holistic evaluation of ISAC systems, bridging the gap between traditional separate assessments of communication and sensing capabilities.

In ISAC, MI evaluates the mutual dependence between transmitted waveforms and received echoes for sensing, alongside the relationship between transmitted data symbols and received signals for communication. For communication, MI reflects the channel's capacity to reliably transmit information, whereas for sensing, it captures the system's ability to extract environmental details from received echoes. This dual perspective allows ISAC systems to balance communication and sensing under shared spectrum and hardware limitations [1].

A significant advantage of MI lies in its ability to analyze the interplay between deterministic and random signals. Deterministic signals excel in radar applications for precise target detection, while random signals dominate communication systems due to their resilience against noise and interference. In ISAC design, balancing these signal types is critical, and MI offers a single analytical framework to achieve this equilibrium. For instance, optimizing waveforms in MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems by maximizing the weighted sum of communication and sensing MI ensures balanced performance across both domains [38].

MI also plays a pivotal role in addressing challenges associated with imperfect channel state information (CSI). Under such conditions, the trade-off between ergodic capacity and sensing accuracy becomes crucial. Closed-form expressions derived using MI for ergodic capacity and range Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB) provide actionable insights into this trade-off [8]. These expressions link achievable performance to parameters like pilot length, aiding in slot structure optimization.

Furthermore, MI extends beyond basic evaluations to support multi-objective optimization. In multi-point ISAC (MPISAC) systems, fusing outputs from multiple devices enhances sensing accuracy through redundancy exploitation. Here, MI drives fusion models that predict accuracy via hypothesis testing and optimal voting analysis [17]. Similarly, in uplink MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems, bounds on communication and sensing MI reveal interactions between the two functions, guiding waveform optimizations aimed at improving overall system performance [52].

MI also illuminates the capacity-distortion tradeoff in ISAC systems operating under correlated sensing and channel states. Non-perfect CSI at the receiver necessitates sophisticated algorithms to determine optimal tradeoffs. Characterizing this tradeoff via a capacity-distortion function quantifies the best communication rate for a given sensing distortion constraint [15]. Iterative algorithms developed for this purpose highlight the advantages of ISAC over separation-based approaches.

Finally, MI addresses specific challenges unique to certain environments or applications. In optical ISAC (O-ISAC), integrating free-space optical communication and optical sensing leverages MI to boost communication rates and sensing precision while mitigating interference [47]. Additionally, in networked sensing within 6G cellular networks, employing MI enhances localization services provided by base stations transformed into powerful sensors [18].

In summary, mutual information stands as a cornerstone in evaluating and optimizing ISAC systems, thanks to its ability to unify performance metrics for both sensing and communication. Its versatility in analyzing trade-offs, accommodating imperfect CSI, supporting multi-objective optimizations, and adapting to diverse environmental demands reinforces its essential role in advancing ISAC technologies. This foundation seamlessly connects to the subsequent discussion on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and its interplay with other critical metrics in ISAC systems.

### 3.2 Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Sensing Performance Metrics

Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a fundamental metric in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, serving as a key indicator of both communication and sensing performance. Bridging the gap between mutual information (MI) evaluations discussed earlier and the capacity-distortion tradeoffs explored later, SNR quantifies the quality of received signals relative to background noise and interference. This directly impacts the system's ability to accurately detect targets and reliably transmit data [2]. The interplay between SNR and traditional radar metrics, such as Cramér-Rao Bound (CRB), Fisher information, and distortion-based measures, forms the backbone of understanding ISAC systems under varying channel conditions.

In ISAC, the shared spectrum and hardware resources introduce unique challenges in optimizing SNR for both sensing and communication. For instance, power allocation must balance these two functions to avoid degradation in either domain. High SNR ensures robust target detection and precise localization in the sensing domain while maintaining reliable communication links [16]. This balance becomes even more critical when operating in environments with significant clutter or multipath effects, where SNR might fluctuate unpredictably, impacting MI-based evaluations and the capacity-distortion tradeoff.

The CRB provides a lower bound on the variance of any unbiased estimator of parameters like distance, velocity, or angle. In ISAC systems, achieving low CRB values relies heavily on maximizing SNR at the receiver. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) enhance SNR by controlling electromagnetic wave propagation, improving parameter estimation accuracy [13]. Additionally, RIS mitigates fading channel effects, ensuring that CRB remains within acceptable limits, which is crucial for addressing imperfections highlighted in multi-objective optimizations.

Fisher information offers another perspective on the relationship between SNR and sensing performance. It reflects the amount of information an observable random variable carries about an unknown parameter. Higher SNR generally translates to higher Fisher information, leading to improved resolution in estimating radar-related parameters. However, non-ideal channel state information (CSI) and imperfect hardware can disrupt this improvement. Efficient beamforming techniques bridge this gap, ensuring high SNR effectively enhances Fisher information [10].

Under different channel conditions, SNR behavior varies significantly. Line-of-sight (LoS) channels yield better SNR compared to non-line-of-sight (NLoS) channels due to reduced path loss and interference. High-mobility scenarios, common in vehicular networks, present additional challenges from Doppler shifts and rapid fading. Advanced modulation schemes, such as Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS), are specifically designed to handle high mobility, maintaining consistent SNR levels across varying conditions [42].

Distortion-based measures further couple with SNR in ISAC systems. Distortion arises from mismatches between transmitted and received signals, often caused by nonlinearities or imperfect waveform design. Minimizing distortion requires careful optimization of SNR, as higher SNR suppresses distortions and improves overall system performance [34]. Techniques like index modulation (IM) reduce distortions without sacrificing spectral efficiency by embedding information in selected indices [22].

Trade-offs between SNR and other performance metrics must also be considered in practical implementations. Increasing SNR may reduce spectral efficiency if excessive power is allocated to sensing. Focusing solely on enhancing SNR might neglect aspects like latency and energy consumption. Multi-objective optimization frameworks find the optimal operating point balancing all relevant criteria [1].

Finally, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) play crucial roles in optimizing SNR for ISAC systems. AI-driven approaches enable adaptive tuning of system parameters based on real-time feedback, allowing dynamic adjustments to changing environmental conditions. These methods prove particularly effective in complex propagation environments or large-scale networks [45].

In conclusion, SNR is pivotal in determining ISAC system performance, influencing both communication reliability and sensing precision. Its relationship with metrics such as CRB, Fisher information, and distortion-based measures highlights the need for comprehensive analysis and optimization strategies tailored to specific application domains. As ISAC evolves, advancements in technologies like RIS, OTFS, and IM will continue to improve SNR management, enabling more capable next-generation wireless systems.

### 3.3 Rate-Distortion Tradeoffs in ISAC Systems

The capacity-distortion tradeoff in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems is a critical aspect requiring analysis from an information-theoretic perspective. Building on the importance of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) discussed earlier, this subsection delves into the interplay between communication rate and sensing distortion, which arises due to the shared use of spectrum and hardware resources [34]. The rate-distortion framework quantifies this tradeoff by characterizing the maximum achievable communication rate for a given level of distortion in sensing performance.

In vehicular networks, where real-time situational awareness and high-speed data exchange are essential, understanding the capacity-distortion tradeoff becomes even more significant. For example, when a vehicle communicates with infrastructure or other vehicles while simultaneously sensing its surroundings, the coexistence of these two functions introduces mutual dependencies. Optimizing one function may degrade the performance of the other [15]. This challenge highlights the need for advanced techniques to manage the shared resources effectively.

A key factor influencing the rate-distortion tradeoff in ISAC systems is the correlation between sensing states and channel states. When the sensing state differs but correlates with the channel state, as often occurs in practical scenarios, the optimal tradeoff can be characterized using a capacity-distortion function. This function quantifies the best possible communication rate for a specified sensing distortion constraint [15]. An iterative algorithm has been proposed to compute this tradeoff, enabling system designers to evaluate how changes in one domain affect the other. For instance, if the sensing requirements become more stringent, reducing allowable distortions, the communication rate must decrease accordingly to maintain resource balance within the system.

Multi-access channels further complicate the rate-distortion tradeoff in ISAC systems. In such environments, multiple users share the same spectrum for both communication and sensing purposes, introducing additional interference and cross-link effects. Managing these interactions requires advanced signal processing techniques, such as Pareto-optimal design, which ensures fair allocation of resources across users and tasks [32]. Such approaches aim to maximize overall network efficiency while respecting individual quality-of-service (QoS) constraints.

From an information-theoretic standpoint, the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI) exacerbates the challenges associated with managing the rate-distortion tradeoff. Imperfect CSI leads to errors in estimating both communication and sensing metrics, necessitating robust algorithms capable of handling uncertainties [8]. Metrics such as ergodic capacity and Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) are commonly employed to assess system performance under varying levels of CSI accuracy. These metrics provide insights into the degradation caused by uncertainty and help guide the development of compensatory mechanisms, aligning closely with optimization strategies discussed in the following section.

Another important consideration is the impact of network density on the rate-distortion tradeoff. As the density of base stations increases, their collective contribution to both communication and sensing tasks improves. However, denser networks also introduce greater interference, requiring sophisticated coordination strategies to maintain optimal performance [39]. Stochastic geometry-based frameworks have proven useful in analyzing the coverage and ergodic rates achieved by ISAC systems under different deployment configurations. For example, increasing the base station density from \(1\) \(\text{km}^{-2}\) to \(10\) \(\text{km}^{-2}\) can significantly boost the ISAC coverage rate from \(1.4\%\) to \(39.8\%\).

Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) offer promising avenues for enhancing the rate-distortion tradeoff in ISAC systems. By dynamically manipulating the electromagnetic environment, IRSs can improve both communication reliability and sensing precision without requiring additional transmit power [40]. Quantized phase-shift designs tailored specifically for active IRS elements enable finer control over reflected signals, thereby improving the SNR experienced by both communication receivers and radar sensors [57].

Finally, cooperative architectures hold substantial potential for mitigating the adverse effects of the rate-distortion tradeoff in ISAC systems. Multi-point coordinated joint transmission combined with distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar techniques enables enhanced performance scaling laws [20]. Specifically, deploying \(N\) ISAC transceivers yields an average cooperative sensing performance improvement according to the \(\ln^2 N\) scaling law. Although this enhancement is less pronounced compared to the \(N^2\) gain achieved with equidistant transceivers, it remains a valuable contribution toward balancing the dual objectives of ISAC.

In conclusion, the capacity-distortion tradeoff in ISAC systems represents a complex interplay between communication and sensing capabilities. Analyzing this tradeoff from an information-theoretic perspective reveals critical insights into the underlying mechanisms driving system performance. Factors such as correlated sensing and channel states, multi-access channels, imperfect CSI, network density, IRS deployment, and cooperative architectures all influence the achievable balance between rate and distortion. Future research should continue exploring innovative methods for addressing these challenges and advancing the state-of-the-art in ISAC technology.

### 3.4 Optimization Techniques for Joint Design

Optimization techniques are essential for balancing the dual objectives of communication and sensing in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. This subsection explores advanced optimization methods applied to ISAC, focusing on alternating optimization (AO), semi-definite relaxation (SDR), gradient-based approaches, and deep learning-based schemes. These methods address non-convex optimization challenges inherent in joint waveform design and beamforming.

Alternating optimization (AO) simplifies complex joint design problems by decomposing them into smaller subproblems that can be iteratively optimized [44]. In cell-free ISAC networks, AO facilitates joint base station mode selection and beamforming, achieving optimal performance while managing interference [44]. Similarly, AO is employed in collaborative precoding for adjacent ISAC base stations, ensuring efficient power usage and maintaining a favorable tradeoff between sensing and communication performance [58].

Semi-definite relaxation (SDR) transforms non-convex quadratic optimization problems into convex semidefinite programs, enabling globally optimal solutions under constraints such as signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) minimization [59]. SDR has been successfully applied in monostatic ISAC systems to minimize mean squared error (MSE) and maximize SINR, demonstrating its versatility across multi-cell scenarios [27].

Gradient-based approaches provide computational efficiency and adaptability, particularly in large-scale systems with continuous variables like phase shifts or beamforming vectors. For instance, in active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided ISAC systems, gradient ascent methods optimize quantized phase-shifts of IRS elements to enhance both sensing and communication performance [57]. Additionally, projected gradient ascent algorithms (PGAM) enable simultaneous optimization of amplitudes and phase shifts in simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) surfaces [28].

Deep learning-based schemes offer innovative solutions by leveraging neural networks to learn optimal policies directly from data, bypassing the need for explicit system models. AI-based continual learning adapts ISAC systems to dynamic environments through reinforcement learning paradigms [19]. Furthermore, deep learning models solve complex waveform design problems, ensuring balanced performance between communication and sensing functionalities [38].

Hybrid approaches combining multiple methodologies often yield superior results. For example, integrating alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with Riemannian gradient descent achieves low-complexity yet accurate RIS phase shift designs in dual-functional MIMO beamforming optimization [46].

Addressing specific challenges, such as interference management, is critical for effective ISAC operation. Strategies including interference suppression, avoidance, and exploitation leverage advanced optimization techniques to control interfering signals and improve overall system performance [16].

Emerging trends focus on exploiting domain-specific properties like near-field effects, spherical wave models, and spatially correlated fading, requiring specialized treatment [60]. Incorporating these aspects into optimization frameworks promises enhanced accuracy and reliability for next-generation ISAC implementations.

In conclusion, optimization techniques play a pivotal role in advancing ISAC technology. Alternating optimization, semi-definite relaxation, gradient-based approaches, and deep learning-based schemes provide robust tools for solving challenging problems in ISAC systems. These methods contribute significantly to realizing high-performance, versatile ISAC systems capable of meeting future wireless network demands.

### 3.5 Robustness to Imperfect Channel State Information

In Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, robustness to Imperfect Channel State Information (CSI) is a critical factor impacting both communication and sensing performance. CSI plays a pivotal role in ISAC systems, influencing beamforming, resource allocation, and interference management strategies. However, obtaining perfect CSI is often challenging due to factors such as channel estimation errors, feedback delays, and limited feedback capacity. This subsection explores the challenges posed by imperfect CSI in ISAC systems and discusses strategies for robust transmission design.

One of the primary issues with imperfect CSI is its impact on beamforming designs. In ISAC systems, optimal beamforming can significantly enhance the sensing rate (SR) and communication rate (CR). For example, in scenarios where a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) configuration is employed, the presence of imperfect CSI can degrade the system's ability to achieve high SR and CR [32]. To address this issue, researchers have proposed robust beamforming techniques that account for uncertainties in CSI. Decomposition-based large deviation inequality approaches have been shown to provide effective solutions for mitigating the effects of imperfect CSI in MIMO-ISAC systems [33].

Another challenge arises from the need to balance communication and sensing objectives under conditions of imperfect CSI. Pareto optimal designs become essential in such scenarios, enabling a trade-off between SR and CR. These designs ensure that the system operates within an acceptable range of performance even when CSI is not perfectly known. Studies have demonstrated that ISAC systems outperform frequency-division sensing and communications (FDSAC) systems in terms of SR and CR regions, particularly under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions [23]. This advantage stems partly from the ability of ISAC systems to adaptively adjust their parameters based on available, albeit imperfect, CSI.

Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) are emerging as a key technology to improve the robustness of ISAC systems against imperfect CSI. IRSs dynamically adjust the phase shifts of reflected signals, enhancing the quality of received signals at the user equipment (UE) or radar receiver [13]. Despite their benefits, designing robust IRS-assisted ISAC systems requires careful consideration of CSI inaccuracies. For instance, in an IRS-empowered ISAC system, the SNR at the radar receiver can be enhanced by 20lg(M) times compared to systems without IRS, where M represents the number of sub-surfaces in the IRS [13]. However, this gain depends heavily on the accuracy of CSI, underscoring the importance of developing robust algorithms that handle CSI uncertainties.

Recent research has explored various strategies to enhance the robustness of ISAC systems to imperfect CSI. One promising approach involves leveraging Bayesian learning frameworks to refine CSI estimates over time. By superimposing sensing pilots onto data symbols, systems can continuously update their knowledge of the channel while minimizing overhead [50]. Such schemes reduce pilot overhead and improve overall spectral efficiency (SE), facilitating low-latency operations critical for emerging ISAC applications like autonomous driving and IoT services.

Decomposition-based large deviation inequality approaches offer another avenue for addressing CSI imperfections. These techniques decompose the optimization problem into simpler subproblems solvable more efficiently under uncertain conditions. For example, in a multi-user ISAC system assisted by IRS, decomposition-based methods can help allocate resources optimally despite imperfect CSI [61]. The use of extreme learning machines (ELMs) in channel estimation further enhances system robustness by reducing computational complexity and improving training speed [61].

The impact of successive interference cancellation (SIC) on ISAC systems should not be overlooked, especially in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based configurations. SIC order selection plays a critical role in determining the high-SNR power offsets and diversity orders of SR and CR. Studies indicate that the choice of SIC order influences the performance of ISAC systems under imperfect CSI conditions [62]. Specifically, communication-centric and sensing-centric SIC orders yield different insights into the trade-offs between SR and CR, providing flexibility in designing robust ISAC systems.

Finally, standardization efforts for ISAC technologies emphasize the need for robust designs capable of handling imperfect CSI effectively. Ensuring coexistence and integration of sensing and communication functionalities under real-world constraints is vital [1]. This includes accounting for CSI uncertainties through advanced signal processing techniques and resource allocation strategies.

In summary, addressing the challenges posed by imperfect CSI in ISAC systems requires innovative solutions ranging from robust beamforming designs to intelligent reflecting surface deployments. Decomposition-based approaches, Bayesian learning frameworks, and successive interference cancellation techniques all contribute to enhancing the robustness of ISAC systems. These advancements pave the way for practical implementations of ISAC technologies in next-generation wireless networks, ensuring reliable performance across diverse operational scenarios.

### 3.6 Multi-Objective Optimization for Pareto Optimal Design

In the realm of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), multi-objective optimization plays a pivotal role in balancing the performance of both sensing and communication, addressing challenges introduced by imperfect channel state information (CSI). Building on the need for robust designs discussed earlier, this subsection delves into multi-objective optimization frameworks that facilitate Pareto optimal designs for diverse ISAC network scenarios, such as monostatic, bistatic, and cooperative networks.

Pareto optimality is central to multi-objective optimization, ensuring no objective can be improved without degrading another. In ISAC systems, this translates to achieving a balanced trade-off between sensing rate (SR) and communication rate (CR). For instance, in monostatic ISAC, where the transmitter and receiver are collocated, simultaneous operation introduces challenges like self-interference [19]. Efficient resource allocation strategies are required to meet communication quality-of-service (QoS) while maintaining acceptable sensing accuracy. Researchers have developed methods to optimize beamforming vectors under various constraints [63], maximizing SR and CR within practical limits.

Bistatic ISAC separates the transmitter and receiver spatially, reducing self-interference but complicating signal alignment due to differing propagation paths [32]. Multi-objective optimization frameworks here must address these complexities. Alternating optimization algorithms, for example, help derive configurations that balance SR and CR across varying conditions [56].

Cooperative ISAC networks enhance performance through collaboration among multiple nodes. Leveraging distributed MIMO radar techniques and coordinated multipoint (CoMP) joint transmission amplifies gains from cooperation [20]. Optimizing cluster sizes and transmit power facilitates flexible SR-CR trade-offs [30], aligning with scaling laws that describe how transceiver density impacts performance.

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) further enrich ISAC optimization by dynamically manipulating the propagation environment, enhancing SR and CR via spatial interference management and constructive reinforcement [53]. However, imperfect CSI introduces complexity, necessitating robust transmission design based on large deviation inequalities and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) to achieve Pareto optimality under uncertainty [56].

Waveform design also plays a critical role in multi-objective optimization. Tailored waveforms consider SR and CR metrics simultaneously. Information-theoretic tools like mutual information (MI) provide a unified evaluation framework [38]. Optimizing waveforms to maximize weighted sums of MI ensures balanced performance, validated through Monte Carlo simulations [52].

Numerical methods enable effective implementation of Pareto optimal designs. Successive convex approximation (SCA) or alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) solve non-convex problems arising in ISAC [46]. Low-complexity gradient-based approaches offer real-time alternatives [40].

Simulation results confirm that multi-objective optimization frameworks significantly improve SR-CR tradeoff regions compared to traditional frequency-division approaches [32]. The complementary behavior of SR and CR in different environments underscores the importance of comprehensive optimization.

In conclusion, multi-objective optimization enables efficient ISAC system design capable of delivering high-quality communication alongside precise sensing. Through Pareto optimal designs, diverse scenarios from monostatic and bistatic configurations to cooperative networks and RIS-assisted setups find practical realization, supporting future 5G/6G advancements.

## 4 Applications of ISAC in Emerging Domains

### 4.1 Autonomous Driving and Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communication

The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) into autonomous driving systems has emerged as a transformative approach for enhancing both safety and efficiency. In particular, ISAC plays a critical role in enabling Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication, which is pivotal for achieving seamless connectivity between vehicles, infrastructure, pedestrians, and other entities within the transportation ecosystem. This subsection explores how ISAC contributes to autonomous driving through V2X communication, enhanced perception via integrated sensing, and real-time data exchange for cooperative driving scenarios.

V2X communication is essential for ensuring that autonomous vehicles have access to comprehensive situational awareness beyond what their onboard sensors can provide directly. By leveraging shared wireless networks, ISAC allows for simultaneous transmission of high-resolution sensor data alongside traditional communication signals [64]. This dual functionality not only reduces hardware redundancy but also improves spectral efficiency, making it a cost-effective solution for future automotive systems. For instance, base stations equipped with ISAC capabilities can broadcast environmental information while receiving updates from connected vehicles about traffic conditions, road hazards, or weather changes. Such bidirectional exchanges ensure that all participants in the network remain synchronized and informed.

One of the key advantages of ISAC in autonomous driving lies in its ability to enhance perception accuracy through integrated sensing. Traditional autonomous driving systems rely heavily on dedicated sensors such as LiDAR, cameras, and radar units to perceive the environment. However, these sensors often face limitations due to occlusions, adverse weather conditions, or limited range. With ISAC, the same radio frequency (RF) waves used for communication can also be employed for target detection, tracking, and localization [3]. This synergy enables autonomous vehicles to achieve superior performance in challenging environments where conventional sensors might fail. Moreover, ISAC-based perception systems benefit from multi-static configurations, where multiple base stations cooperate to extend coverage and improve resolution [8].

Real-time data exchange facilitated by ISAC further enhances cooperative driving scenarios, enabling advanced functionalities like platooning, intersection management, and emergency braking coordination. In platooning applications, closely spaced groups of vehicles share trajectory planning and control information to optimize fuel consumption and reduce travel time. Here, ISAC ensures ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) while simultaneously monitoring the relative positions and velocities of neighboring vehicles [6]. Similarly, at intersections, ISAC supports collaborative decision-making among approaching vehicles to minimize delays and prevent collisions. Emergency braking scenarios also leverage ISAC’s dual capabilities by rapidly disseminating alerts across the network while confirming the presence of obstacles using shared sensing resources.

The adoption of ISAC in V2X communication brings significant improvements over traditional separated systems. First, ISAC eliminates the need for additional spectrum allocation since communication and sensing share the same bandwidth [1]. Second, joint waveform design tailored for both tasks leads to better resource utilization and reduced interference [38]. 

Despite its potential, implementing ISAC in autonomous driving presents several challenges. One major concern involves interference management when integrating communication and sensing functionalities within the same system. Self-interference caused by concurrent transmissions and receptions must be mitigated effectively to preserve both communication quality and sensing fidelity [19]. Another challenge relates to energy efficiency, especially considering the computational demands of processing large volumes of sensory data in real-time. Additionally, standardization efforts are still underway to define common frameworks and metrics for evaluating ISAC performance across diverse use cases [4].

In conclusion, ISAC represents a groundbreaking advancement for autonomous driving and V2X communication. Its ability to seamlessly integrate sensing and communication functions addresses many of the limitations inherent in current systems. Through enhanced perception, real-time data exchange, and cooperative driving capabilities, ISAC promises to revolutionize the way we interact with intelligent transportation systems. As research progresses, overcoming existing challenges will pave the way for more robust, efficient, and scalable implementations of ISAC in next-generation vehicular networks. These advancements not only support the development of smart cities but also align with broader goals of improving urban infrastructure management, safety, and sustainability [15].

### 4.2 Smart Cities and Urban Infrastructure Management

Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems have emerged as a transformative technology for enhancing urban infrastructure management and revolutionizing the concept of smart cities. Building upon its applications in autonomous driving and industrial IoT, ISAC extends its dual functionality to intelligent traffic control, environmental monitoring, and resource optimization within urban environments [1]. By converging communication and sensing capabilities into a unified framework, ISAC not only reduces hardware costs but also improves spectral efficiency, positioning itself as an essential solution for next-generation urban infrastructure.

However, with these advancements comes an increasing demand for secure ISAC frameworks that ensure data integrity and user privacy. Building upon the synergies between ISAC and edge computing discussed earlier, this subsection explores the significance of security and privacy in ISAC systems, emphasizing trust mechanisms and blockchain-based approaches for decentralized cooperation.

In a world where connectivity is ubiquitous, ensuring the confidentiality, authenticity, and availability of transmitted information becomes paramount [34]. ISAC systems inherently operate under shared resources—both spectrum and hardware—which amplifies the risk of interference, unauthorized access, and malicious attacks. To address these challenges, it is crucial to develop robust cryptographic protocols and secure communication channels tailored for ISAC environments. These protocols must not only protect the integrity of communication data but also preserve the accuracy and reliability of sensing information [8].

A critical component of securing ISAC systems lies in establishing trust mechanisms among participating entities within the network. Trust models are designed to evaluate the behavior of nodes and determine their reliability before granting them access to sensitive information or system functionalities. For instance, in cooperative ISAC networks, multiple transceivers collaborate to enhance both sensing and communication performance. Ensuring that each participant adheres to predefined rules and does not compromise the overall system performance requires sophisticated trust evaluation techniques [20]. These techniques may involve reputation management systems where nodes accumulate trust scores based on their past actions and contributions to the network.

Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution for fostering trust and enabling decentralized cooperation in connected ecosystems [45]. By leveraging blockchain's inherent immutability and transparency properties, ISAC systems can record all transactions and interactions in a tamper-proof manner, thereby enhancing accountability and traceability across the network. Moreover, smart contracts embedded within blockchain platforms allow for automated execution of predefined rules and agreements between parties without requiring intermediaries. This capability is particularly valuable in scenarios involving multi-stakeholder participation, such as vehicular networks or industrial IoT applications, where coordination among independent actors is essential [72].

## 5 Challenges and Limitations in ISAC Implementation

### 5.1 Interference Management in ISAC Systems

Interference management stands as one of the most critical challenges in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. By cohesively utilizing shared spectrum and hardware resources for both communication and sensing, ISAC introduces various types of interference that must be effectively managed to ensure optimal system performance. This subsection delves into the different forms of interference in ISAC systems—such as self-interference, mutual interference, and clutter—and discusses techniques for their suppression, avoidance, and exploitation.

Self-interference emerges when signals intended for communication interfere with those used for sensing, or vice versa, within the same ISAC device. This issue is particularly pronounced in monostatic architectures where the same base station (BS) transmits and receives signals for both tasks [19]. Such interference can degrade the quality of service (QoS) for both communication and sensing, leading to increased error rates and reduced detection accuracy. To mitigate this, advanced techniques such as joint transmit and receive beamforming policies have been proposed. These methods spatially separate the communication and sensing signals, thereby reducing interference [19].

Mutual interference arises between multiple ISAC devices operating in close proximity, especially when they share the same spectrum. Their transmitted signals may interfere with each other, affecting both communication and sensing performance. Cooperative multi-monostatic sensing frameworks offer a promising solution by enabling multiple nodes to collaborate and coordinate their activities, mitigating mutual interference [17]. In these frameworks, the outputs from multiple ISAC devices are fused to achieve higher sensing performance while maintaining efficient communication links. Additionally, AI-based continual learning approaches adapt ISAC systems to dynamic environments, ensuring robustness against mutual interference [3].

Clutter interference refers to unwanted reflections from stationary objects in the environment, which can obscure target signals during sensing operations. Clutter is particularly problematic in outdoor scenarios, such as autonomous driving and smart city applications, where the environment is complex and dynamic. Techniques like clutter removal algorithms, including spectral subtraction and wavelet denoising, have proven effective in enhancing target detection in industrial settings [6]. Waveform design also plays a pivotal role in minimizing clutter effects by tailoring the transmitted signal to meet the specific requirements of both communication and sensing tasks [38].

Beyond suppression and avoidance, there is growing interest in exploiting interference to improve ISAC system performance. Exploiting interference involves leveraging its inherent characteristics to extract useful information. For instance, in cooperative ISAC networks, interference from neighboring BSs can enhance target localization accuracy [64]. Similarly, in holographic ISAC systems, large-scale arrays and precise beamforming techniques can transform interference into constructive contributions to overall system performance [2].

Effective interference management often combines hardware improvements with software-based algorithms. On the hardware side, advancements in antenna design, power amplifiers, and RF front-ends are essential for reducing interference at the source [4]. Software solutions include deep learning-based schemes for optimizing waveform design and beamforming configurations [73]. These schemes handle non-convex optimization problems and provide robust performance even under imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions [8].

From an optimization perspective, multi-objective optimization techniques are indispensable for balancing the competing demands of communication and sensing in ISAC systems. These techniques aim to find Pareto-optimal solutions that maximize the weighted sum of normalized sensing rate and normalized communication rate while minimizing interference [73]. Advanced signal processing methods, such as spherical wave models and near-field effects, further enhance the ability of ISAC systems to manage interference in complex environments.

Finally, standardization efforts are underway to define common frameworks, metrics, and protocols for interference management in ISAC systems [1]. These efforts address diverse application scenarios and industry requirements, ensuring interoperability and scalability across different use cases. As ISAC continues to evolve, novel interference management techniques will undoubtedly emerge, driven by advances in artificial intelligence, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), and other key enabling technologies.

These constraints arise from the shared spectrum and hardware architecture required for ISAC, affecting critical components such as antennas, power amplifiers, RF front-ends, and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS). Addressing these limitations is essential for achieving efficient and practical ISAC implementations while ensuring seamless integration with 5G/6G networks.

Antenna design presents one of the primary challenges in ISAC systems. To support both communication and sensing functionalities within the same frequency band, antennas must provide high gain and low interference levels [2]. Achieving this dual functionality often involves advanced beamforming techniques and innovative array configurations adaptable to varying channel conditions and application requirements. However, designing such antennas introduces complexities related to size, weight, and manufacturing costs. For instance, phased-array antennas, commonly used in radar systems due to their electronic beam-steering capabilities, increase system complexity and power consumption, creating a delicate balance between performance and practicality [34].

Power amplifiers pose another significant challenge. High-efficiency amplifiers are crucial for reliable long-distance and wide-bandwidth operation [17]. Traditional amplifiers optimized for either communication or sensing alone may fail to meet the stringent demands of simultaneous ISAC operations. Moreover, achieving high linearity, necessary for waveforms with complex modulations, typically reduces efficiency, leading to higher energy consumption and heat dissipation issues. This conflict requires careful design decisions regarding the emphasis placed on communication versus sensing, potentially involving additional cooling mechanisms.

RF front-ends also contribute substantially to the challenges of ISAC deployments. These components, including mixers, filters, oscillators, and low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), play a vital role in system performance. In ISAC scenarios, RF front-ends must handle signals across multiple domains simultaneously, introducing distortions and interferences that degrade overall performance unless mitigated [16]. Solutions often involve sophisticated signal processing algorithms and advanced circuit designs, which raise concerns about increased hardware complexity and associated costs.

The integration of IRS technology adds another layer of complexity to ISAC architectures. IRS relies on large arrays of reconfigurable elements to manipulate electromagnetic waves effectively [41]. While promising for coverage extension and interference suppression, IRS deployment escalates implementation costs and limits scalability depending on the target application scenario. Each element in an IRS array requires precise control over its phase shifts and amplitudes, demanding specialized digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

Cost containment remains a dominant factor influencing ISAC hardware design choices. To achieve widespread adoption, especially in resource-constrained environments like IoT networks, minimizing costs without compromising fundamental capabilities is imperative. Simpler architectures utilizing fewer antennas or basic power amplifiers could reduce expenses but might result in suboptimal performance metrics. Conversely, adopting state-of-the-art technologies such as holographic arrays or fully digital beamformers delivers superior outcomes yet entails prohibitively high investments for many applications [21].

Complexity represents another dimension where compromises must occur. Advanced features enabling adaptive waveform generation, joint optimization of sensing and communication parameters, and real-time interference management add substantial computational burdens to already challenging hardware platforms. Ensuring robustness against dynamic environmental changes while minimizing latency necessitates powerful processors alongside memory-intensive storage solutions. Balancing these competing interests requires ingenuity in architectural design alongside novel algorithmic approaches tailored specifically for ISAC contexts [15].

Performance degradation caused by hardware imperfections cannot be overlooked. Nonideal characteristics inherent in actual devices—such as phase noise in oscillators, thermal drift in sensors, and quantization errors in ADCs/DACs—all diminish theoretical gains predicted during idealized modeling phases. Mitigation strategies, ranging from calibration routines to enhanced redundancy schemes, aim to counteract these effects but introduce added layers of sophistication complicating already intricate designs [22].

In conclusion, addressing hardware limitations in ISAC implementation requires holistic strategies encompassing antenna design, power amplifier optimization, RF front-end enhancements, IRS integration, cost containment, complexity reduction, and performance preservation. Each decision carries implications extending beyond individual subsystems toward affecting the entire network's operational integrity and economic viability. Future research directions should focus on developing scalable, cost-effective, and energy-efficient hardware architectures capable of delivering reliable ISAC services under diverse real-world conditions. This work will complement efforts in interference management and energy efficiency, further advancing the feasibility and sustainability of ISAC systems in 5G/6G networks.

### 5.3 Energy Efficiency Challenges in ISAC Networks

Energy efficiency is a critical concern in the development and deployment of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems, particularly as they become integral to 5G/6G networks [7]. While ISAC offers significant improvements in spectral and hardware efficiency by integrating sensing and communication functionalities, it also increases power consumption due to the dual-purpose nature of these devices. This subsection examines the energy efficiency challenges in ISAC systems and explores strategies to minimize power consumption while preserving acceptable performance levels.

A major challenge arises from the shared use of spectrum and hardware resources for both communication and sensing tasks. Although resource sharing enhances overall system efficiency, it introduces additional computational and transmission overheads. For example, designing waveforms that meet the requirements of both domains demands advanced signal processing techniques, which can be computationally intensive and energy-consuming [17]. Similarly, advanced beamforming techniques necessary for optimizing multi-domain performance add complexity and increase energy usage.

Interference management further complicates energy efficiency in ISAC systems [16]. Effective mitigation of self-interference, mutual interference, and clutter is essential for reliable operation. However, techniques like interference suppression or avoidance often require additional power, potentially increasing the system’s energy footprint. Balancing interference mitigation with energy consumption remains a key challenge.

To address these issues, researchers have proposed green ISAC approaches aimed at reducing power consumption without sacrificing performance. One promising avenue involves leveraging intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) to enhance efficiency. IRS technology allows precise control over electromagnetic waves via reconfigurable elements, improving resource utilization and minimizing the need for high-power transmitters [40]. Strategic IRS deployment can lead to better coverage and higher data rates with lower energy consumption.

Optimizing resource allocation and management is another effective strategy for improving energy efficiency. Efficiently allocating power, spectrum, and time slots between communication and sensing functions can significantly reduce unnecessary energy expenditure. Multi-objective optimization frameworks have been developed to balance the competing demands of sensing and communication, ensuring optimal performance under given constraints [8]. These frameworks typically involve deriving closed-form expressions for metrics such as ergodic capacity and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of range sensing, followed by designing algorithms for pilot length optimization.

Advancements in signal processing also contribute to enhanced energy efficiency. Spatial path index modulation (SPIM), for instance, exploits multipath wireless channels to transmit extra information bits via spatial paths, boosting spectral efficiency and reducing power consumption [21]. Additionally, index modulation (IM) has been explored as a method to embed information-bearing communication symbols into radar waveforms, enabling simultaneous sensing and communication with minimal energy overhead [22].

As ISAC systems transition to practical implementation, considerations beyond technical aspects—such as regulatory and business model constraints—are vital for shaping energy-efficient designs. Spectrum sharing mechanisms must be carefully designed to facilitate coexistence among technologies while utilizing available spectrum efficiently [74]. Such considerations are crucial for ensuring the sustainability and long-term viability of ISAC networks.

In conclusion, overcoming energy efficiency challenges in ISAC requires a comprehensive approach combining innovative waveform design, advanced interference management, intelligent resource allocation, and cutting-edge signal processing methods. Continued research will help strike a balance between energy consumption and performance, paving the way for greener and more sustainable ISAC systems in the era of 5G/6G communications.

### 5.4 Standardization Efforts for ISAC Technologies

Standardization efforts for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technologies are crucial to enabling widespread adoption across diverse applications and industries. The current state of ISAC standardization is in its infancy, with significant challenges yet to be addressed in defining common frameworks, metrics, and protocols. These challenges stem from the multifaceted nature of ISAC systems, which must balance both communication and sensing objectives under shared resources.

One primary challenge in standardizing ISAC lies in the development of unified performance metrics that can effectively measure both sensing and communication capabilities [19]. While traditional communication systems rely on metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral efficiency, sensing systems typically employ measures like Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for localization accuracy or mean squared error (MSE) for parameter estimation. Bridging these disparate metrics into a cohesive framework remains an open problem. For instance, mutual information (MI) has been proposed as a potential unifying metric due to its applicability in both domains [38]. However, further research is needed to establish MI’s practicality in real-world ISAC deployments.

Another critical aspect of standardization involves defining the architecture of ISAC systems. Various architectures have been explored, including monostatic, multistatic, and cooperative designs [17]. Each architecture presents unique advantages and trade-offs, making it difficult to settle on a single standardized approach suitable for all use cases. Monostatic architectures, for example, offer simplicity but suffer from self-interference issues when simultaneous transmission and reception occur at the same base station [59]. In contrast, multistatic and cooperative architectures mitigate self-interference by spatially separating transmitters and receivers, albeit at the cost of increased complexity [44]. Standardization must therefore account for the varying needs of different application scenarios while ensuring compatibility between heterogeneous architectures.

The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) adds another layer of complexity to ISAC standardization [46]. RIS technology enables dynamic manipulation of electromagnetic waves, offering opportunities to enhance both sensing and communication performance through precise beamforming and interference management. However, standardizing RIS-assisted ISAC requires addressing challenges such as quantized phase-shift design, power allocation strategies, and coordination among multiple RIS units [57]. Furthermore, the coexistence of active and passive RIS elements necessitates careful consideration of their respective roles and limitations within ISAC frameworks.

Interference management represents another key area requiring standardization. ISAC systems inherently face various types of interference, including self-interference, mutual interference, and clutter [16]. Effective interference suppression, avoidance, and exploitation techniques vary depending on the specific system configuration and operating environment. Developing standardized methods for managing interference in ISAC systems would facilitate interoperability and reduce deployment costs. Techniques such as joint beamforming optimization and coordinated multipoint (CoMP) operations have shown promise in mitigating cross-link interference in multi-cell setups [27].

In addition to technical considerations, standardization efforts must also address regulatory and policy aspects associated with ISAC technologies. Spectrum sharing plays a pivotal role in enabling ISAC, yet existing regulations often prioritize either communication or sensing functions rather than accommodating both simultaneously [15]. Harmonizing spectrum policies to support ISAC requires collaboration between governments, industry stakeholders, and international organizations. Moreover, ensuring cybersecurity and privacy protection in ISAC systems will be essential as they become integral components of smart cities, autonomous driving, and other connected ecosystems [75].

Emerging trends such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) further complicate standardization efforts by introducing additional layers of complexity in resource allocation and signal processing [48]. NOMA-based ISAC designs aim to harmoniously accommodate sensing and communication functionalities through advanced signal alignment and interference cancellation techniques. Standardization must capture the nuances of these approaches while maintaining flexibility to adapt to evolving technological advancements.

Finally, the importance of benchmarking and testing methodologies cannot be overstated in ISAC standardization. Establishing consistent evaluation procedures ensures fair comparisons between competing ISAC solutions and promotes trust in the technology. Simulation studies conducted under controlled conditions provide valuable insights but may not fully capture the intricacies of real-world deployments [28]. Therefore, developing standardized testbeds capable of emulating diverse operational environments becomes imperative for validating ISAC performance claims.

In summary, standardization efforts for ISAC technologies face numerous challenges spanning technical, regulatory, and societal dimensions. Addressing these challenges demands close cooperation among academia, industry, and policymakers to define universal frameworks, metrics, and protocols. By fostering consensus around best practices and encouraging innovation within established guidelines, standardization will play a vital role in accelerating the deployment of ISAC systems across various domains, particularly in overcoming coverage gaps and resolution degradation highlighted in networked sensing contexts.

### 5.5 Networked Sensing Limitations and Enhancements

Networked sensing in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems introduces unique challenges and opportunities that must be addressed to achieve optimal performance. As ISAC technologies evolve, networked configurations are essential for enhancing situational awareness and communication efficiency. However, coverage gaps and resolution degradation remain critical limitations that hinder the full potential of these systems.

Coverage gaps in ISAC networks arise due to factors such as non-uniform node distribution, shadowing effects, and multipath fading. In multi-device deployments, these gaps can severely degrade overall system performance by reducing target detection and localization accuracy. For example, areas not adequately covered by any device experience high sensing uncertainties exacerbated by fading and interference [17]. This limitation underscores the need for strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage across all operational zones.

Resolution degradation constitutes another major challenge in ISAC systems. The shared spectrum between sensing and communication functions often introduces mutual interference, which compromises the resolution of both functionalities. This issue becomes particularly pronounced in dense node environments or under challenging propagation conditions. According to "Rethinking the Performance of ISAC System: From Efficiency and Utility Perspectives" [76], the trade-off between ergodic capacity with imperfect channel estimation and the ergodic Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for range sensing directly impacts system resolution [8].

To overcome these limitations, cooperative architectures provide a promising solution. By enabling collaboration among multiple ISAC devices, these architectures exploit multi-view data redundancy to enhance overall system performance. For instance, the fusion model proposed in [17] leverages hypothesis testing and optimal voting analysis to effectively combine outputs from multiple devices, improving both sensing precision and communication reliability [17].

Multi-domain measurements offer an additional avenue for addressing the challenges of networked sensing in ISAC systems. These approaches involve utilizing information across different physical domains—such as time, frequency, and space—to enrich the available data for processing. The implementation of spatial path index modulation (SPIM), as discussed in [21], exemplifies this technique's potential. SPIM transmits additional information bits via modulating spatial paths, thereby enhancing spectral efficiency and providing richer spatial domain information to mitigate coverage gaps and improve resolution [21].

Advanced signal processing techniques also play a vital role in overcoming the limitations of networked ISAC systems. Methods such as sparse Bayesian learning and superimposed symbol schemes have demonstrated their ability to significantly enhance both communication and sensing capabilities. In [50], the superimposition of sensing pilots onto data symbols reduces pilot overhead while maintaining high spectral efficiency. Additionally, the structure-aware sparse Bayesian learning framework uses decoded data symbols as side information to improve sensing performance, addressing resolution degradation challenges [50].

Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) represent another enhancement for improving ISAC system performance. IRS technology extends coverage and suppresses interference, making it highly effective in overcoming coverage gaps. As shown in [13], IRS deployment amplifies the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the radar receiver, improving radar detection probability and reducing the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for ranging and velocity estimation [13]. Moreover, IRS contributes to parameter estimation and security enhancements, bolstering the robustness of networked sensing.

In conclusion, while networked sensing in ISAC systems encounters significant challenges such as coverage gaps and resolution degradation, these issues can be mitigated through innovative solutions. Cooperative architectures, multi-domain measurements, advanced signal processing techniques, and the integration of IRS collectively contribute to more reliable and efficient ISAC systems. By incorporating these enhancements into ISAC network designs, we can unlock their full potential and meet the stringent requirements of future 5G/6G applications.

## 6 Future Directions and Research Opportunities

### 6.1 Advanced Signal Processing Techniques

As the field of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) evolves, advanced signal processing techniques are becoming increasingly critical to enhance both communication and sensing capabilities. One emerging technique involves spherical wave models, which improve the accuracy of ISAC systems by accounting for the curvature of waves near antennas. Unlike traditional planar wave assumptions suited for far-field distances, spherical wave models consider propagation characteristics in the near-field region, offering a more accurate representation of electromagnetic field distribution [6]. This advancement is especially beneficial in scenarios such as vehicular networks or smart cities, where objects may be located within the near-field of the transmitter.

Another significant advancement is the consideration of near-field effects. Conventional radar and communication systems rely on far-field assumptions that simplify mathematical formulations but can lead to inaccuracies when objects are in the near-field. These effects must be carefully modeled to ensure optimal performance of ISAC systems. By incorporating near-field effects into waveform design and channel modeling, researchers can achieve higher resolution and precision in target detection and localization [77]. This capability enables ISAC systems to operate effectively in confined spaces like indoor environments or urban canyons, where near-field interactions dominate.

Spatially correlated fading also significantly impacts ISAC system performance. Correlated fading arises due to spatial dependencies between multipath components received by multiple antennas in Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) systems. Addressing this issue is essential for robust ISAC system design. In MIMO-OFDM configurations, correlated fading across subcarriers and spatial domains can degrade both communication and sensing performances. Recent research proposes joint optimization strategies that account for the correlation structure of fading channels. Waveform designs based on mutual information (MI) metrics have demonstrated superior performance in managing correlated fading effects, thereby improving overall system efficiency [52].

Innovative methods like multi-point fusion further enhance ISAC systems. Distributed architectures enable the fusion of data from multiple ISAC devices, reducing uncertainties caused by interference or shadowing. Multi-point ISAC (MPISAC) systems exploit redundancy in multi-view data to improve sensing performance while maintaining efficient communication [17]. This approach leverages collaborative processing among nodes, enhancing reliability and coverage compared to single-node solutions. It also provides flexibility through adaptive functionality selection modules that dynamically allocate resources between sensing and communication tasks depending on instantaneous demands.

The integration of intelligent surfaces presents another avenue for advancing ISAC signal processing. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) allow precise control over electromagnetic wavefronts, facilitating the manipulation of both communication and sensing signals. By optimizing the reflection coefficients of RIS elements, it becomes possible to mitigate interference, extend coverage, and enhance resolution simultaneously [40]. Moreover, RIS-assisted ISAC architectures introduce new degrees of freedom for resource allocation, paving the way for sophisticated beamforming algorithms tailored specifically for dual-purpose operation.

To address complex non-convex optimization problems in ISAC waveform design, deep learning (DL)-based approaches offer promising alternatives. Traditional optimization methods often struggle with high computational complexity when solving coupled objectives involving communication and sensing rates. DL models provide efficient approximations capable of achieving comparable results with reduced overhead. A study exploring uplink ISAC systems highlights the effectiveness of DL-based schemes in jointly optimizing sensing transmit waveforms and communication receive beamforming [73]. This methodology addresses mutual interference issues inherent in spectrum sharing and demonstrates strong adaptability under varying environmental conditions.

Finally, holographic ISAC represents a cutting-edge direction in signal processing innovation. Large-scale metasurface arrays equipped with precise beamforming capabilities enable simultaneous transmission of focused beams for communication and wide-area scanning for sensing purposes [36]. Leveraging holographic principles, these systems promise unparalleled levels of performance in both domains, especially in scenarios requiring ultra-high-resolution imaging or massive connectivity support.

These advanced signal processing techniques—spherical wave models, near-field effects, spatially correlated fading management, distributed sensing fusion, intelligent surface empowerment, deep learning integration, and holographic implementations—are pivotal for advancing ISAC technology. As we continue pushing boundaries toward 5G/6G networks, embracing these innovations will undoubtedly unlock new possibilities for seamless coexistence of communication and sensing functionalities, setting the stage for semantic communications as described in subsequent sections.

### 6.2 Semantic Communications

Semantic communications introduce a transformative paradigm in ISAC systems by emphasizing the meaningful content of messages rather than raw data bits, thus enhancing efficiency and reducing redundancy. This approach aligns well with 5G/6G networks, where communication and sensing are deeply integrated [34]. Leveraging AI-driven context-aware encoding techniques, semantic communications adaptively tailor transmitted information to specific tasks, significantly improving spectral efficiency and energy consumption.

The core advantage of semantic communications lies in its focus on task-relevant data. Traditional systems often transmit large amounts of irrelevant or redundant information unnecessarily. Semantic communications overcome this by extracting only the most pertinent information for each application. For instance, in autonomous driving scenarios, an ISAC system may prioritize transmitting critical sensory data about nearby vehicles or pedestrians while omitting less relevant environmental details [1]. This selective transmission reduces bandwidth requirements and enhances overall system performance.

AI plays a pivotal role in enabling semantic communications within ISAC systems. Advanced machine learning models analyze the context of both communication and sensing tasks to identify "task-relevant" data. For example, deep neural networks can be trained to detect patterns in sensor data that signify important events like potential collisions or traffic congestion. These insights facilitate more efficient waveform design and resource allocation strategies, ensuring optimal use of valuable spectrum resources [36].

In addition to boosting spectral efficiency, semantic communications also improve energy efficiency. Fewer bits need to be transmitted due to the focused nature of the information, thereby decreasing power consumption—a critical factor in ultra-dense 6G networks with stringent energy constraints. Furthermore, integrating semantic communications into ISAC frameworks complements emerging trends such as edge computing and multi-access edge computing (MEC), which emphasize processing data closer to its source [66]. By minimizing data transfer between devices and centralized servers, semantic communications reduce latency and enhance reliability, essential for real-time applications.

A key challenge in implementing semantic communications within ISAC systems is designing robust algorithms capable of accurately identifying task-relevant data under diverse conditions. While AI-based methods hold promise, they necessitate extensive training datasets and computational resources, potentially complicating already intricate ISAC architectures [16]. Ensuring compatibility among different ISAC components—such as radar sensing modules and communication transceivers—remains another open research question.

Security implications of semantic communications must also be considered. Focusing exclusively on task-relevant data might expose vulnerabilities if adversaries manipulate the selection process or inject malicious inputs. Securing reliable operation requires careful design, possibly incorporating cryptographic techniques or blockchain-based trust mechanisms [78].

Looking ahead, several exciting research directions exist at the intersection of semantic communications and ISAC systems. Developing novel waveforms specifically optimized for dual functionality while embedding semantic principles is one promising avenue. Such waveforms could leverage delay-Doppler domains or other mathematical representations to achieve superior performance in high-mobility environments [42]. Another area ripe for exploration involves creating decentralized approaches for managing semantic information across distributed nodes in large-scale ISAC networks, requiring investigation into cooperative protocols and consensus mechanisms.

Furthermore, combining semantic communications with emerging technologies like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) offers intriguing possibilities. RIS-assisted ISAC systems have already demonstrated their potential for enhancing coverage, suppressing interference, and improving parameter estimation accuracy [41]. Incorporating semantic encoding into these systems could yield unprecedented levels of flexibility and adaptability, paving the way for highly intelligent wireless ecosystems.

Ultimately, the convergence of semantic communications and ISAC systems represents fertile ground for innovation. By concentrating on conveying meaningful information tailored to specific tasks, these hybrid systems promise enhanced efficiency and resilience against evolving network demands and dynamic operational contexts.

### 6.3 Holographic ISAC

Holographic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems represent a cutting-edge advancement in the pursuit of enhanced performance for both communication and sensing capabilities. This emerging technology leverages large-scale arrays and advanced beamforming techniques to achieve superior performance in both domains [21]. Building upon the principles of semantic communications, holographic ISAC systems focus on delivering meaningful information tailored to specific tasks while optimizing resource utilization.

The utilization of large-scale antenna arrays in holographic ISAC systems allows for unprecedented spatial resolution and beamforming accuracy. These arrays are capable of generating complex radiation patterns tailored to specific sensing and communication tasks, enabling simultaneous operation with minimal interference [40]. By exploiting the vast degrees of freedom provided by such arrays, holographic ISAC systems can adaptively optimize their operation to meet the stringent requirements of next-generation wireless networks, particularly in scenarios demanding high-precision localization or ultra-reliable communications.

Beamforming plays a pivotal role in achieving this level of performance. In holographic ISAC, precise beamforming techniques allow for the creation of multiple beams simultaneously, each targeting different users or sensing targets [32]. This capability is critical for enhancing spectral efficiency while maintaining the quality of both communication links and sensing functions. Furthermore, these techniques support dynamic adaptation to changing environmental conditions, ensuring robustness and flexibility across diverse operational scenarios. Similar to the selective transmission in semantic communications, holographic ISAC systems prioritize task-relevant data through sophisticated beamforming algorithms.

Another key aspect of holographic ISAC systems is their ability to exploit subcarrier-dependent analog-only and beam-split-aware beamformers. Such approaches address challenges like the beam-split effect, which arises from the use of subcarrier-independent analog beamformers at millimeter-wave frequencies. By employing sophisticated algorithms for estimating radar and communication parameters, these systems mitigate potential drawbacks associated with hybrid beamforming architectures [21]. Consequently, they deliver higher spectral efficiency even under challenging conditions where traditional fully digital non-spatial path index modulation (non-SPIM) beamformers may fall short.

In addition to technical advancements, holographic ISAC holds promise for addressing practical challenges faced by modern wireless networks. For instance, it can significantly enhance the capacity of urban cellular networks through improved interference management and network densification strategies [39]. Moreover, its applicability extends beyond terrestrial applications into areas such as non-terrestrial networking, where it offers opportunities for integrating satellite constellations into global connectivity frameworks [11]. This aligns well with multi-domain cooperation efforts aimed at leveraging collaboration among multiple users, frequency bands, and network layers.

However, implementing holographic ISAC comes with certain challenges that need to be addressed. One major issue pertains to hardware complexity and cost implications arising from deploying massive antenna arrays. To tackle this challenge, researchers have explored innovative solutions like quantized phase-shift designs for active intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), demonstrating substantial performance benefits without compromising on practicality [57]. Additionally, there exist fundamental trade-offs between sensing and communication performances within holographic ISAC systems. Careful optimization of resource allocation, including power distribution and frequency band usage, becomes essential to ensure balanced functionality across both domains [8].

From an architectural standpoint, holographic ISAC also introduces unique considerations regarding system design and integration. As highlighted in recent surveys, adopting distributed architectures enables large-scale tracking of connected entities while preserving energy efficiency [3]. Combining this approach with semantic and goal-oriented frameworks paves the way for novel paradigms aimed at optimizing resource utilization further. Such innovations not only bolster multi-modal sensing capabilities but also facilitate seamless interaction among heterogeneous devices within IoT ecosystems [36].

Looking ahead, future research directions in holographic ISAC should focus on overcoming remaining limitations and exploring untapped potential. Areas warranting attention include advancing theoretical understanding around information-theoretic limits governing joint sensing and communication performance, refining adaptive algorithms capable of handling real-world uncertainties, and investigating synergistic interactions between holographic ISAC and complementary technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces [2]. Ultimately, continued progress in holographic ISAC will play a crucial role in shaping the landscape of 5G/6G networks, delivering transformative capabilities that redefine what is possible in integrated sensing and communication.

### 6.4 Multi-Domain Cooperation

Multi-domain cooperation in ISAC systems builds upon the advancements of holographic ISAC by further enhancing overall network performance through collaboration among multiple users, frequency bands, and network layers. This cooperative strategy enables ISAC systems to achieve superior communication and sensing capabilities while optimizing resource utilization.

One critical aspect involves integrating diverse types of users within a unified ISAC framework. By coordinating activities across domains such as vehicular networks, IoT devices, and smart cities, ISAC systems can effectively balance communication and sensing requirements [44]. For instance, in autonomous driving scenarios, vehicles equipped with ISAC capabilities can share real-time traffic and environmental data with roadside units and other vehicles. This fosters more accurate perception and improved decision-making [45].

Frequency band allocation plays a pivotal role in ensuring efficient ISAC operation. Leveraging multiple frequency bands allows these systems to overcome limitations inherent to individual bands and improve overall performance. High-frequency bands, like millimeter waves, offer enhanced resolution for sensing but suffer from high propagation losses. Conversely, lower frequency bands provide better coverage yet may lack sufficient bandwidth for high data rate communications. Combining both high and low-frequency bands via multi-band cooperation enables ISAC systems to exploit their respective strengths while mitigating weaknesses [33].

Network layer cooperation enhances ISAC effectiveness by enabling seamless interaction between hierarchical network levels. In cell-free massive MIMO-assisted ISAC architectures, distributed access points (APs) collaborate to serve communication users and perform cooperative sensing tasks. These APs dynamically adjust their transmission modes according to network conditions and user demands, ensuring optimal performance under varying scenarios [75]. Furthermore, this cooperative mechanism facilitates robust inter-cell coordination, reducing interference and improving spectral efficiency.

Joint optimization of communication and sensing functionalities is another key dimension of multi-domain cooperation. Advanced beamforming techniques enable ISAC systems to direct energy precisely toward desired targets while minimizing interference. Tailored joint beamforming designs consider not only spatial user distribution but also the characteristics of each domain involved. For example, in bistatic or multistatic configurations, coordinated strategies ensure effective reception of reflected signals from distant targets [27]. Additionally, dual-functional precoders have been proposed to meet stringent quality-of-service requirements for both communication and sensing, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional approaches [46].

The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) represents a promising avenue for advancing multi-domain cooperation. RIS-equipped nodes introduce additional degrees of freedom, enabling dynamic control over electromagnetic wave propagation. Through adaptive adjustment of phase shifts applied to incident signals, RIS elements can enhance either communication links or radar echoes depending on operational priorities [57]. STAR-RIS technologies extend beyond passive reflection capabilities by supporting simultaneous transmission and reflection operations, offering greater flexibility in managing trade-offs between communication and sensing objectives [28].

Despite technical advancements, challenges persist in addressing interference management when dealing with heterogeneous entities across disparate domains. Effective solutions must account for self-interference arising within monostatic setups as well as cross-link interference occurring between adjacent base stations [16]. Novel algorithms incorporating machine learning paradigms show promise in continuously adapting to changing environmental conditions and user behaviors.

Standardization efforts are essential to establish unified frameworks governing interactions among diverse components constituting multi-domain ISAC ecosystems. Harmonizing protocols, metrics, and interfaces ensures smooth interoperability regardless of underlying hardware platforms or software implementations [59]. Standard bodies should actively engage stakeholders representing various sectors benefiting from ISAC technologies—such as automotive manufacturers, telecommunications providers, and urban planners—to foster consensus around best practices and promote widespread adoption.

In conclusion, multi-domain cooperation extends the potential of ISAC systems by fostering synergistic relationships among multiple users, frequency bands, and network layers. This research direction holds great promise for achieving higher levels of communication and sensing performance and aligns closely with advancements in AI-driven optimization explored in subsequent sections. Continued exploration promises innovative solutions that address existing limitations and pave the way toward truly intelligent wireless networks envisioned for future generations.

### 6.5 AI Integration

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a pivotal technology for optimizing complex systems, including integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Following the advancements in multi-domain cooperation, AI plays a critical role in addressing key challenges such as waveform design, interference management, and resource allocation to enhance ISAC system performance for both high-quality communication and accurate sensing.

Waveform design is one of the primary areas where AI contributes significantly. Traditional methods often struggle to adaptively optimize waveforms for dynamic environments. By integrating deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), ISAC systems can generate waveforms tailored to specific scenarios [34]. This enables dynamic adjustments of parameters like bandwidth, modulation schemes, and power levels based on real-time conditions, thereby improving spectral efficiency.

Interference management represents another domain where AI offers substantial improvements. As ISAC systems operate within shared frequency bands, they encounter various types of interference, including self-interference, mutual interference, and clutter [16]. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches allow ISAC systems to learn optimal strategies for interference suppression through interactions with their environment [62]. These adaptive techniques continuously refine interference handling capabilities over time, enhancing overall system performance.

Resource allocation also benefits greatly from AI integration. Efficiently balancing resources such as transmit power, bandwidth, and antennas between communication and sensing functions remains crucial for achieving optimal trade-offs. Techniques like multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) enable simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives, such as maximizing communication rate while minimizing sensing error [33]. Additionally, AI incorporates contextual information about network states and user demands, further refining the allocation process [35].

AI's influence extends beyond individual components to provide holistic enhancements at the system level. For example, joint beamforming design leverages advanced AI techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), to optimize beamforming vectors in multi-user MIMO-ISAC systems [23]. These designs consider channel state information, user locations, and target trajectories to maximize throughput while maintaining sensing accuracy.

Moreover, AI fosters innovative paradigms in ISAC systems, such as semantic communications and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS). Semantic communications focus on conveying task-relevant information rather than raw bits, reducing redundancy and enhancing efficiency [17]. Similarly, IRS-empowered ISAC systems utilize AI to control phase shifts of reflecting elements, shaping the wireless propagation environment for improved communication and sensing [13].

Despite these advancements, challenges persist in integrating AI into ISAC systems. Collecting large datasets for training AI models may be hindered by privacy concerns or hardware limitations. Deploying computationally intensive algorithms at edge devices could increase latency and energy consumption, potentially undermining some benefits of ISAC. Ensuring robustness against adversarial attacks remains an open research question [50].

In conclusion, AI integration marks a promising direction for future ISAC research. Through advancements in waveform design, interference management, and resource allocation, AI enhances ISAC capabilities, aligning closely with the objectives outlined in multi-domain cooperation and preparing the foundation for multi-connectivity solutions. Continued exploration in this area brings us closer to realizing the full potential of ISAC in next-generation wireless networks [1].

### 6.6 Multi-Connectivity Solutions

Multi-connectivity solutions represent a critical direction for the advancement of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, particularly in 5G/6G networks. Building upon the AI-driven optimizations discussed earlier, multi-connectivity aims to combine different access technologies—terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks—to enhance reliability, coverage, and performance in both communication and sensing functionalities. This subsection explores the challenges, opportunities, and potential approaches for achieving effective multi-connectivity in ISAC systems.

The integration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks within ISAC frameworks offers significant advantages, such as expanded coverage areas and improved resilience against environmental factors [34]. Non-terrestrial networks, including satellite and aerial platforms, provide extensive geographical reach, which is crucial for applications like disaster management, remote sensing, and autonomous navigation in sparsely populated regions. Meanwhile, terrestrial networks excel at delivering high data rates over shorter distances, ensuring robust urban connectivity. By combining these capabilities, ISAC systems can achieve balanced trade-offs between range, accuracy, and throughput while aligning with the sustainability goals outlined in subsequent sections.

One promising approach involves leveraging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to optimize signal propagation across diverse network domains. RISs dynamically adapt the electromagnetic environment by reflecting or refracting signals, thereby mitigating interference and enhancing spectral efficiency [53]. For instance, RISs can assist in redirecting signals from satellites to ground stations, improving reception quality even under adverse atmospheric conditions. Additionally, they facilitate seamless transitions between terrestrial and non-terrestrial links, reducing handover latency and packet loss during mobility scenarios [45].

Another key consideration in designing multi-connectivity ISAC systems is addressing the unique demands of each domain. Terrestrial networks typically operate under dense multipath environments, necessitating advanced techniques such as MIMO-OFDM to maximize spatial diversity gains [52]. On the other hand, non-terrestrial networks face challenges like long propagation delays and limited bandwidth due to the vast distances involved. To overcome these limitations, novel waveform designs must be developed that strike an appropriate balance between communication rate and sensing resolution [38].

Moreover, multi-connectivity introduces additional complexity in terms of resource allocation and coordination among heterogeneous components. Efficient algorithms are required to manage shared resources, such as spectrum and power, while minimizing interference between concurrent operations. Multi-objective optimization techniques become indispensable here, allowing designers to explore various trade-off regions depending on application-specific priorities [30]. By optimizing parameters such as transmit beamforming vectors and phase shifts of auxiliary devices, it becomes possible to achieve near-optimal performance across all connected nodes.

A notable example of multi-connectivity implementation is the use of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS)-assisted architectures [28]. These systems extend traditional RIS functionality by enabling dual-mode operation, where part of the incident signal is reflected while another portion is transmitted forward. Such mechanisms significantly increase flexibility in adapting to dynamic environments encountered in hybrid terrestrial-non-terrestrial setups. Furthermore, STAR-RIS facilitates efficient handling of mutual interferences arising between coexisting radar and communication subsystems, thus promoting cohabitation without compromising individual performances.

Security concerns also arise with increased reliance on multi-connectivity strategies since vulnerabilities could potentially propagate through interconnected layers [56]. Protecting sensitive information exchanged via such expansive configurations requires implementing stringent safeguards, possibly involving encryption schemes tailored specifically for ISAC contexts. Moreover, incorporating blockchain-based trust mechanisms might further bolster reliability when multiple stakeholders participate in collaborative tasks spanning wide geographic extents [69].

In conclusion, multi-connectivity represents a pivotal future research direction for ISAC systems seeking to unify disparate access technologies into cohesive infrastructures capable of delivering enhanced services. Through innovative combinations of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks supported by cutting-edge tools like RISs and sophisticated algorithmic paradigms, substantial improvements in reliability and coverage can be attained. Addressing inherent complexities associated with cross-domain interactions remains paramount; however, ongoing advancements suggest promising pathways toward realizing this ambitious vision, while setting the stage for sustainable ISAC frameworks discussed in the following sections.

### 6.7 Sustainable ISAC Frameworks

As we continue to explore the realm of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) for 5G/6G networks, it becomes essential to address sustainability as a key factor in system design. Following the advancements in multi-connectivity solutions discussed earlier, this subsection focuses on developing sustainable ISAC frameworks that not only enhance performance but also ensure long-term viability through energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact. Achieving a balance between spectral efficiency, energy consumption, and operational longevity presents one of the primary challenges in ISAC systems.

Energy efficiency serves as a cornerstone for any sustainable framework in wireless communication systems [79]. The optimization of power consumption while maintaining acceptable levels of communication and sensing performance is critical. Papers such as "Energy Efficient Beamforming Optimization for Integrated Sensing and Communication" propose methodologies aimed at maximizing energy efficiency (EE) by reformulating complex problems using techniques like successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR). These approaches provide benchmarks for designing systems that reduce power consumption without compromising functionality.

In addition to optimizing existing resources, integrating renewable energy sources into ISAC systems represents another avenue for promoting sustainability. Although direct implementation might pose challenges due to intermittent energy supply from renewables, hybrid energy storage solutions combined with intelligent resource management algorithms can mitigate these issues. For example, adaptive transmission schemes based on available solar or wind energy levels could dynamically adjust the system's operation mode [80].

Environmental considerations extend beyond mere energy savings; they encompass material usage, lifecycle analysis, and ecological footprint assessment. Technologies involving reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are particularly noteworthy because they offer passive means to enhance signal propagation, thereby reducing reliance on active components that consume significant amounts of electricity [81]. By employing metamaterial-based RISs, which require minimal maintenance and possess extended lifetimes compared to traditional hardware setups, future ISAC deployments could minimize their carbon footprints considerably.

Furthermore, the concept of green ISAC emphasizes minimizing electromagnetic pollution alongside improving efficiency [82]. Careful design of waveforms and beamforming patterns ensures minimal disruption to surrounding ecosystems while enabling high-quality service provision within desired regions. Robustness against uncertainties in channel conditions becomes crucial when striving toward eco-friendly operations since unpredictable variations might otherwise necessitate additional power expenditures to compensate for losses.

Another important aspect relates to scalability and adaptability over time. Future-proofing ISAC architectures involves ensuring compatibility with evolving standards and emerging technologies. Modular designs allow seamless upgrades as newer components become available, preventing obsolescence and waste generation associated with frequent replacements [83]. Incorporating machine learning techniques facilitates autonomous optimization according to real-time demands, further promoting sustainable practices throughout the entire lifecycle of the network infrastructure.

Security remains integral even amidst discussions about sustainability. Protecting sensitive data exchanged during both sensing and communication phases protects user privacy and maintains trustworthiness [84]. Ensuring secure transmission paths contributes indirectly yet significantly toward preserving resources by averting unauthorized access attempts that would otherwise lead to unnecessary retransmissions and increased power dissipation.

In conclusion, crafting sustainable ISAC frameworks requires multi-faceted efforts spanning across multiple domains, including energy-efficient design principles, utilization of advanced materials like RIS, integration of renewable energies, reduction of electromagnetic interference, emphasis on longevity via modularity, adoption of AI-driven self-optimization capabilities, adherence to stringent security protocols, and thorough evaluation of overall ecological impacts before large-scale deployment [45]. Each element plays an indispensable role in shaping resilient next-generation wireless networks capable of addressing contemporary challenges posed by rapid technological advancements alongside growing societal expectations regarding environmental stewardship.
