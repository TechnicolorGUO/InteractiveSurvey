# 2 Introduction
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the field of chemistry has revolutionized the way researchers approach complex problems, from molecular design to reaction prediction and material synthesis [1]. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool in this domain, offering the potential to automate and enhance various chemical tasks [2]. These models, which are pre-trained on vast amounts of textual data, can be fine-tuned to understand and generate chemical information with high accuracy and efficiency. The application of LLMs in chemistry is particularly promising due to the structured and often textual nature of chemical data, such as molecular structures represented in SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) format and chemical reactions described in scientific literature [1]. This survey paper explores the current state and future prospects of LLMs in chemistry, highlighting their capabilities, limitations, and the methodologies used to enhance their performance [3].

The research topic of this survey paper focuses on the application of LLMs in chemistry, specifically in tasks such as molecular structure recognition, chemical reaction prediction, and material property prediction [4]. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the methodologies used to integrate LLMs with chemical data, including domain-specific pre-training, task-focused instruction fine-tuning, and the integration of specialized tools [5]. It also examines the performance of LLMs in zero- and few-shot settings, where the models are expected to perform tasks with limited or no task-specific training data. Additionally, the survey discusses the development of hybrid quantum-classical models and the use of multimodal alignment frameworks to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in handling complex chemical data.

The paper begins by exploring the integration of LLMs in educational chemistry tasks, where models are used to parse and recognize molecular structures from images and text [6]. This section delves into the open-source paradigms for model training, iterative model refinement, and the role of user feedback in enhancing model performance. The discussion then shifts to data source optimization, focusing on techniques such as convex minimization for data mixture and the training and validation of proxy models [7]. These techniques are crucial for improving the efficiency and accuracy of LLMs in handling large and diverse datasets [8]. The paper also examines the computational cost reduction strategies that enable real-time processing and scalable deployment of LLMs in industrial applications.

Next, the survey explores the tool invocation and optimization strategies that enhance the performance of LLMs in chemical tasks [5]. This includes hierarchical tool stacking, which optimizes the invocation of multiple tools to form a robust and efficient workflow, and the integration of multiple tools within LLM frameworks to automate and optimize various scientific tasks. The paper also discusses case studies and benchmarking efforts that evaluate the performance of LLMs in real-world applications, highlighting the challenges and successes of these models in handling complex, noisy, and previously unseen chemical data [3].

The contributions of this survey paper are multifaceted [9]. It provides a comprehensive overview of the current methodologies and techniques used to integrate LLMs in chemical tasks, offering insights into the strengths and limitations of these approaches [5]. The paper also identifies key areas for future research, such as the development of more sophisticated multimodal models and the integration of quantum computing principles to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in handling high-dimensional chemical data. By synthesizing the latest research and providing a detailed analysis of the field, this survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in the application of LLMs in chemistry [3].

# 3 Integration of LLMs in Chemical Tasks

## 3.1 Educational Chemistry Tasks

### 3.1.1 Open-Source Paradigms for Model Training
In the realm of open-source paradigms for model training, the development of large-scale, annotated datasets has been pivotal in advancing the capabilities of molecular recognition models. One notable example is the MolParser-7M dataset, which comprises over 7 million paired image-SMILES data, making it the largest annotated dataset for molecular recognition to date [6]. This dataset not only includes a vast amount of synthetic data but also incorporates real-world in-the-wild data, such as images cropped from PDF scans of chemical patents. The inclusion of diverse and noisy real-world data is crucial for training models that can generalize well to unseen and complex chemical structures, thereby addressing the limitations of models trained on smaller, more controlled datasets.

The training process for the MolParser model exemplifies a progressive and adaptive approach, starting with pretraining on the synthetic portion of the MolParser-7M dataset [6]. During this phase, the intensity of data augmentation is gradually increased to enhance the model's robustness and adaptability. This strategy is designed to simulate the variability and noise present in real-world data, preparing the model for more challenging tasks. Following pretraining, the model is fine-tuned on a subset of 400,000 in-the-wild real data samples. This fine-tuning step is critical for bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world data, ensuring that the model can effectively recognize and parse chemical structures as they appear in practical applications. The result of this training paradigm is a model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the WildMol-10k benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining large-scale synthetic data with real-world fine-tuning.

The success of the MolParser model underscores the importance of open-source paradigms in model training, particularly in the context of chemical recognition. Open-source datasets and training frameworks facilitate collaboration and innovation by providing researchers with the tools and resources needed to develop and refine models. The MolParser-7M dataset, for instance, serves as a valuable resource for the research community, enabling the development of more robust and versatile molecular recognition models [6]. Additionally, the transparent and reproducible training processes, such as those described for MolParser, contribute to the advancement of the field by allowing other researchers to build upon and extend existing work. This collaborative approach is essential for addressing the real-world challenges that current models face, such as processing complex and noisy chemical structures in patent documents.

### 3.1.2 Iterative Model Refinement and Validation
Iterative model refinement and validation play a crucial role in enhancing the performance and robustness of machine learning models, particularly in the context of chemical structure recognition and synthesis planning. In the case of the MolParser model, iterative refinement begins with extensive pretraining on the MolParser7M dataset, which contains a diverse array of synthetic chemical structures. This pretraining phase is designed to expose the model to a wide range of molecular configurations, thereby improving its generalization capabilities. Gradually increasing the intensity of data augmentation during this phase helps the model learn to handle variations and noise, which are common in real-world data.

Following the pretraining, the model undergoes fine-tuning on a subset of 400k real-world data points. This step is critical as it bridges the gap between synthetic and real-world scenarios, allowing the model to adapt to the nuances and complexities of actual chemical structures found in patent documents and other sources. The fine-tuning process is iterative, with each cycle refining the model's ability to accurately parse and interpret chemical structures. The result of this iterative refinement is evident in the model's performance on the WildMol-10k benchmark, where it achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.9%, significantly outperforming previous models.

To ensure the reliability and robustness of the refined model, rigorous validation is conducted using a variety of benchmarks and real-world datasets. This validation process involves evaluating the model's performance under different conditions, including noisy and distorted data, to assess its resilience and adaptability. The iterative nature of the refinement and validation process allows for continuous improvement, as feedback from each validation cycle is used to further refine the model. This approach not only enhances the model's accuracy but also ensures that it can effectively handle the diverse and challenging data encountered in real-world applications.

### 3.1.3 User Feedback for Model Enhancement
User feedback plays a critical role in enhancing the performance and applicability of machine learning models, particularly in specialized domains such as chemistry. In the context of the MolParser model, user feedback can be leveraged to refine the model's ability to handle noisy and distorted data, which is a common challenge in real-world applications. By incorporating user feedback, the model can be fine-tuned to better recognize and correct errors introduced by such distortions, thereby improving its robustness and accuracy. This feedback can be collected through interactive sessions where users provide corrections or annotations for model outputs, which are then used to update the model's parameters.

Moreover, user feedback can help address the limitations of traditional molecular representation formats, such as SMILES, which are often inadequate for complex tasks like Markush-molecule matching [6]. Users can provide insights into the specific challenges they face when using these formats, which can guide the development of more advanced and context-aware representations. For instance, user feedback can highlight the need for hierarchical and structured data formats that better capture the complexity of molecular structures, leading to more effective model training and inference. This iterative process of feedback and refinement ensures that the model remains aligned with the evolving needs of the user community.

In the broader context of large language models (LLMs), user feedback is equally crucial for enhancing their performance in chemical applications [2]. LLMs, while powerful, often struggle with precise mathematical and logical reasoning, as well as the interpretation of non-textual data such as molecular structures [10]. By integrating user feedback, these models can be fine-tuned to better understand and process chemical data, leading to more accurate predictions and more reliable decision-making. Additionally, user feedback can help mitigate issues such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge, ensuring that the model remains up-to-date and reliable. This feedback-driven approach not only improves the model's performance but also fosters a more collaborative and user-centric development process.

## 3.2 Data Source Optimization

### 3.2.1 Convex Minimization for Data Mixture
Convex minimization plays a pivotal role in optimizing data mixtures, particularly in scenarios where multiple data sources are combined to improve model performance [7]. The primary challenge in data mixture optimization is to determine the optimal weights for each data source such that the overall performance on a target dataset is maximized. This is achieved by formulating the problem as a convex minimization task, where the objective function is defined to minimize the loss on the target dataset. The convexity of the problem ensures that the optimization process converges to a global optimum, making it computationally efficient and reliable.

To effectively solve the convex minimization problem for data mixtures, a two-stage approach is often employed. In the first stage, a proxy model is trained for each data source, capturing the unique characteristics and distributions of the respective datasets. These proxy models serve as initial estimators, providing a basis for evaluating the contribution of each data source to the final mixture. The second stage involves learning the optimal mixture of these proxy models' outputs for the target dataset. This is achieved by defining a convex objective function that measures the performance of the mixed model on the target dataset. The convexity of the objective function allows for the use of gradient-based optimization methods, which can efficiently find the optimal weights for the data mixture.

A key insight in this approach is the restriction of the loss functions to cross-entropy (CE) or mean-squared error (MSE), which simplifies the data mixing objective and makes it amenable to first-order optimization. By leveraging the fact that the Bayes optimal model for a mixture is the mixture of the Bayes optimal models for each source, the bi-level optimization problem reduces to a convex minimization task. This reduction not only simplifies the optimization process but also ensures that the resulting mixture is robust and generalizes well to unseen data. Practical implementations of this approach have demonstrated significant improvements in model performance, especially in scenarios where the target dataset is small or noisy, and the inclusion of diverse data sources is crucial for enhancing model robustness and accuracy.

### 3.2.2 Proxy Model Training and Validation
Proxy model training and validation play a pivotal role in optimizing the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning workflows, particularly in computationally intensive tasks such as molecular recognition and chemical property prediction. In the context of MolParser, the proxy model is trained on a large synthetic dataset, MolParser-7M, which consists of over 7 million paired image-SMILES data. This dataset is designed to capture a wide range of molecular structures and variations, ensuring that the proxy model can generalize well to real-world scenarios. The training process involves gradual data augmentation, starting with simple transformations and progressively increasing the complexity to simulate the diversity of real-world data. This approach helps the model learn robust features that are invariant to various forms of noise and distortion, thereby enhancing its performance on in-the-wild data.

During the validation phase, the proxy model is fine-tuned on a subset of 400k real-world data points, which are cropped from PDF scans of patent documents. This step is crucial for bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world data, as it allows the model to adapt to the specific characteristics and challenges of actual chemical structures. The fine-tuning process is carefully monitored to ensure that the model does not overfit to the training data, maintaining a balance between generalization and specialization. The performance of the proxy model is evaluated on the WildMol-10k benchmark, where it achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.9%, significantly outperforming previous models. This success underscores the importance of using a large, diverse training dataset and the effectiveness of fine-tuning on real-world data.

To further validate the robustness of the proxy model, extensive experiments are conducted to assess its performance under various conditions, including different levels of data augmentation and varying degrees of noise. The results indicate that the model maintains high accuracy even when faced with complex, noisy, or previously unseen chemical structures. This robustness is attributed to the comprehensive training regimen and the use of a large, diverse dataset. Additionally, the proxy model's ability to handle real-world data is enhanced by the human-in-the-loop data curation process, which ensures that the training data is of high quality and representative of real-world scenarios. Overall, the training and validation of the proxy model in MolParser demonstrate a systematic approach to building reliable and efficient machine learning systems for molecular recognition tasks.

### 3.2.3 Computational Cost Reduction
Computational cost reduction is a critical aspect of advancing machine learning models in cheminformatics, particularly in the context of large-scale data processing and real-time applications. Traditional methods, such as those based on SMILES strings, often suffer from inefficiencies due to the lack of hierarchical structure and the need for extensive preprocessing, which can significantly increase computational overhead. To address these challenges, recent approaches have focused on optimizing both the model architecture and the data representation to enhance computational efficiency. For instance, MolParser, which achieves an inference speed of up to 40 FPS, employs a lightweight architecture that reduces the computational burden while maintaining high accuracy [6]. This efficiency is crucial for industrial applications where real-time processing and rapid decision-making are essential.

Another key strategy for reducing computational costs involves the use of advanced optimization techniques, such as Bayesian optimization (BO), which can efficiently navigate complex optimization spaces with principled uncertainty guidance [11]. BO algorithms, particularly those utilizing Gaussian Processes, are well-suited for scenarios with expensive evaluations and vast design spaces, such as those encountered in drug discovery and materials science. These methods balance exploration and exploitation to minimize the number of required evaluations, thereby reducing the overall computational cost. Additionally, the integration of BO with large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in accelerating the optimization process by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to guide the search for optimal solutions.

Furthermore, the development of efficient data mixing strategies, such as MixMin, has also contributed to computational cost reduction. MixMin optimizes the convex objective of finding the best mixture of data sources to train on for a downstream loss, using cheaply computed proxy models [7]. This approach significantly reduces the computational burden compared to traditional methods that rely on expensive zero-order optimization techniques like grid search. By training a few inexpensive models for each data source and the target dataset, MixMin can efficiently identify the optimal mixture weights, leading to improved performance and reduced computational costs [7]. These advancements collectively represent a significant step forward in making machine learning models more practical and scalable for cheminformatics applications.

## 3.3 Tool Invocation and Optimization

### 3.3.1 Hierarchical Tool Stacking for Task Performance
Hierarchical Tool Stacking (HTS) is a novel approach designed to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in chemistry-related tasks by optimizing the tool invocation process [5]. The core idea of HTS is to explore and construct optimal tool invocation pathways through a hierarchical stacking strategy, which is tailored to the specific requirements of a given chemical task [5]. This method systematically evaluates and integrates multiple tools, each with its unique strengths and capabilities, to form a robust and efficient workflow. By doing so, HTS aims to address the limitations of single-tool approaches, which often struggle with the complexity and diversity of chemical tasks, such as reaction prediction, retrosynthesis planning, and molecular design.

The hierarchical stacking strategy in HTS involves a multi-level decision-making process that dynamically selects and combines tools based on the task context and the current state of the workflow. At the top level, the strategy identifies the primary task and the most suitable high-level tools to address it. Subsequently, these tools can invoke lower-level tools to handle specific sub-tasks, creating a cascading hierarchy of tool invocations. This hierarchical structure allows for a more granular and adaptive approach to task execution, enabling the system to leverage the strengths of each tool at the appropriate stage of the workflow. For instance, in retrosynthesis planning, a high-level tool might be responsible for generating initial reaction pathways, while lower-level tools could be used to refine and validate these pathways by checking the availability of starting materials and the feasibility of each step.

Empirical evaluations of HTS have shown significant improvements in task performance compared to traditional single-tool approaches. The hierarchical stacking strategy not only enhances the accuracy and efficiency of task execution but also improves the interpretability of the results. By defining and analyzing four behavioral patterns of models during the tool stacking process, researchers have gained deeper insights into the reasons behind the performance improvements [5]. These patterns include the identification of optimal tool sequences, the dynamic adjustment of tool parameters, and the effective handling of task-specific constraints. The enhanced interpretability of HTS makes it a valuable tool for both research and industrial applications, where transparency and reliability are crucial. Overall, HTS represents a significant step forward in the integration of LLMs and specialized tools for complex chemical tasks.

### 3.3.2 Case Studies and Benchmarking
In the realm of chemical structure recognition and interpretation, case studies and benchmarking play a pivotal role in evaluating the robustness and effectiveness of various models. Notably, MolParser has emerged as a leading model, demonstrating significant advancements in handling noisy and distorted data, which are common in real-world documents and patents. MolParser's performance, with an accuracy of 66.4%, surpasses that of MolScribe (66.4%) and MolGrapher (45.5%), and its inference speed of up to 40 FPS (131 FPS for the tiny version) makes it particularly suitable for industrial applications [6]. These benchmarks highlight the importance of not only accuracy but also computational efficiency in practical deployments.

However, despite these achievements, current models still face substantial challenges, especially when dealing with complex, noisy, or previously unseen chemical structures in patent documents. The primary issue lies in the disparity between the synthetic, small-scale training data and the real-world data scenarios encountered in practical applications. This discrepancy underscores the need for more robust and diverse training datasets that better reflect the variability and complexity of real-world chemical structures. Efforts to bridge this gap are crucial for advancing the field and ensuring that models can generalize effectively to new and challenging data.

To address these challenges, recent studies have explored the integration of large language models (LLMs) with deep learning techniques, aiming to leverage the extensive knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in chemical applications [12]. For instance, LIDDIA, a novel framework, has demonstrated promising results in drug discovery by generating and refining molecules that meet key pharmaceutical properties [13]. Through rigorous benchmarking, LIDDIA has shown a success rate of over 70% across 30 major therapeutic targets, highlighting its potential to streamline and enhance the drug discovery process [13]. These case studies and benchmarks not only validate the effectiveness of integrating LLMs with domain-specific tasks but also pave the way for future innovations in computational chemistry [3].

### 3.3.3 Integration of Multiple Tools
The integration of multiple tools within the framework of Large Language Models (LLMs) for chemical applications presents a significant advancement in automating and enhancing the efficiency of chemical research [1]. This integration allows for the seamless combination of LLMs with specialized tools such as molecular structure parsers, reaction predictors, and knowledge graphs, thereby enabling more sophisticated and accurate analyses [5]. For instance, the extension of SMILES representation to accommodate specialized molecules, including Markush structures and polymer formations, enhances the LLM's ability to process and analyze complex chemical entities [6]. This extended format is not only compatible with established libraries like RDKit but also optimized for LLMs, facilitating the automation of tasks such as chemical structure recognition and synthesis planning.

Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with knowledge graphs and multi-branched reaction pathway search algorithms has revolutionized retrosynthesis planning [10]. Traditional approaches often rely on deep-learning methods for specific tasks, but the integration of LLMs allows for a more holistic and flexible approach [14]. These LLMs can dynamically retrieve and incorporate new synthesis data from literature, continuously updating the knowledge graph and expanding the scope of possible reaction pathways [5]. This dynamic updating ensures that the system remains current and can adapt to new discoveries, making it a powerful tool for identifying authoritative and feasible synthesis routes. The Multi-branched Reaction Pathway Search (MBRPS) Algorithm, in particular, plays a crucial role in this process by systematically exploring and recommending the most viable synthesis pathways [10].

In practical applications, the integration of multiple tools within LLM frameworks has been demonstrated to significantly enhance performance and efficiency. For example, ChemCrow, an LLM chemistry agent, integrates 18 expert-designed tools to perform tasks ranging from organic synthesis to materials design [15]. Similarly, the Context-Aware Language Model for Science (CALMS) assists scientists in complex experimentation by integrating LLMs with instrument operations and data analysis. These integrated systems leverage the pre-trained knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automate and optimize various scientific tasks, reducing the need for manual intervention and increasing the throughput of research activities [5]. The robust generalization and adaptability of these integrated systems across diverse chemical tasks highlight their potential to accelerate scientific discovery and innovation in fields such as drug discovery and materials science.

# 4 Evaluation and Benchmarking of LLMs in Chemistry

## 4.1 Empirical Model Comparisons

### 4.1.1 Domain-Specific Pre-Training
Domain-specific pre-training of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a crucial strategy to enhance their performance in specialized fields such as chemistry [12]. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, which are pre-trained on vast amounts of web data, domain-specific pre-training involves tailoring the model to the unique characteristics and requirements of a specific domain. In chemistry, this approach leverages large datasets of chemical compounds, reactions, and properties to imbue the model with a deeper understanding of chemical principles and phenomena [16]. This pre-training phase is essential because the generic web data used in standard LLMs often lacks the depth and specificity required for accurate chemical reasoning and prediction [3].

During domain-specific pre-training, LLMs are exposed to a diverse array of chemical data, including molecular structures, reaction mechanisms, and material properties [6]. This exposure helps the model learn the intricate patterns and relationships that are characteristic of chemical systems. For instance, models like ChemBERTa and T5-Chem have been pre-trained on large chemical corpora, resulting in improved performance in tasks such as molecular property prediction and reaction outcome prediction. These models demonstrate that domain-specific pre-training can significantly enhance the model's ability to handle complex chemical problems, even in low-data environments where traditional machine learning methods might struggle [17].

However, the effectiveness of domain-specific pre-training is not uniform across all tasks. While it can substantially improve performance in tasks that require deep domain knowledge, such as predicting the outcomes of chemical reactions or estimating material properties, it may not always be necessary for simpler tasks that do not demand extensive chemical expertise. Moreover, the choice between pre-training from scratch versus fine-tuning a pre-existing model depends on the availability of domain-specific data and computational resources [17]. Pre-training from scratch allows for a more tailored model but requires substantial computational power and data, whereas fine-tuning a pre-trained model can be more resource-efficient and still yield significant performance gains [17]. Empirical studies have shown that a combination of self-supervised pre-training and task-focused fine-tuning often provides the best balance between performance and efficiency, making it a popular approach in the field of chemical LLMs.

### 4.1.2 Task-Focused Instruction Fine-Tuning
Task-focused instruction fine-tuning is a critical approach for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific chemistry tasks [17]. This technique involves refining pre-trained LLMs using task-specific instructions and data, which helps in aligning the model's outputs more closely with the requirements of specialized chemistry tasks [5]. Unlike general fine-tuning, which may use a broad dataset, task-focused instruction fine-tuning leverages carefully curated datasets that are representative of the target task, such as molecular property prediction or chemical reaction synthesis [17]. This targeted approach ensures that the model learns the nuances and complexities inherent in chemistry, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.

In practice, task-focused instruction fine-tuning often involves several steps. First, a set of task-specific instructions is created, which guides the model on how to interpret and respond to chemistry-related queries. These instructions can range from simple prompts asking the model to predict the outcome of a chemical reaction to more complex tasks requiring the model to generate detailed explanations of molecular interactions. The model is then fine-tuned on a dataset that includes these instructions and corresponding correct answers. This process helps the model to develop a deeper understanding of the task and to generate more contextually appropriate responses. For instance, when fine-tuned on tasks involving SMILES strings, the model can better handle the unique syntax and semantics of these molecular representations, leading to improved performance in tasks such as molecular property prediction and reaction prediction [6].

However, task-focused instruction fine-tuning also presents challenges. One of the primary issues is the availability and quality of task-specific data. Chemistry is a highly specialized field, and obtaining high-quality, annotated datasets can be difficult and time-consuming. Additionally, the effectiveness of task-focused instruction fine-tuning can vary depending on the complexity of the task and the model's initial capabilities [17]. While this approach can significantly enhance performance on specialized tasks, it may not always lead to improvements in more general chemistry tasks. Therefore, a balanced approach that combines task-focused instruction fine-tuning with broader fine-tuning strategies is often necessary to achieve optimal results. Furthermore, ongoing research is exploring ways to optimize the fine-tuning process, such as through the use of adaptive learning rates and more sophisticated data augmentation techniques, to further enhance the model's performance on chemistry tasks.

### 4.1.3 Performance in Zero- and Few-Shot Settings
In the realm of zero- and few-shot settings, large language models (LLMs) exhibit varying degrees of performance, particularly when applied to specialized domains such as chemistry [18]. These models, despite their general capabilities, often struggle with tasks that require deep domain-specific knowledge, such as predicting molecular properties or synthesizing compounds. For instance, while general LLMs like GPT-4 and LLaMA demonstrate impressive versatility across a wide array of tasks, they frequently underperform on chemistry-specific tasks, as highlighted in Figure 1 [3]. This underperformance can be attributed to the lack of exposure to specialized chemical data and the absence of task-specific tools during training.

To mitigate these limitations, several approaches have been explored, including the integration of task-specific tools and the use of pre-trained models fine-tuned on chemistry datasets [17]. For example, the integration of tools like those in ChemCrow, which includes 18 specialized tools for chemical tasks, has shown promise in enhancing the performance of LLMs in zero- and few-shot settings [15]. These tools provide the models with additional capabilities to handle complex chemical representations, such as SMILES strings and 3D molecular geometries, thereby improving their ability to perform specialized tasks. However, the effectiveness of these tools is highly dependent on the specific characteristics of the task, with some tasks benefiting more than others.

Furthermore, the performance of LLMs in zero- and few-shot settings can be significantly influenced by the quality and quantity of the initial training data. Pre-trained models like MatSciBert and ChemBERTa, which are trained on large chemistry-focused datasets, have been shown to perform comparably to fine-tuned models, suggesting that extensive pre-training on domain-specific data can be as effective as fine-tuning in many cases [17]. This finding is particularly relevant in low-data environments, where the availability of labeled data is limited. Additionally, the use of multimodal features, such as combining 2D molecular graphs with 3D geometries, has been shown to further enhance the performance of LLMs in zero- and few-shot settings by providing a more comprehensive representation of molecular structures [4].

## 4.2 Hybrid Quantum-Classical Models

### 4.2.1 Quantum Self-Attention Mechanism
The Quantum Self-Attention Mechanism (QSAM) represents a significant advancement in the integration of quantum computing principles with traditional self-attention mechanisms used in transformers [19]. Unlike classical self-attention, which relies on the computation of dot products between query and key vectors, QSAM leverages quantum states and unitary transformations to capture complex correlations within data [19]. This mechanism is particularly advantageous in handling high-dimensional data, such as molecular structures, where the classical approach can become computationally prohibitive. By encoding query and key representations into quantum states, QSAM can perform operations that are inherently parallel and scalable, thus reducing the computational complexity and enhancing the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies.

In QSAM, the attention mechanism is implemented using a quantum circuit that includes a series of qubits and controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates. The qubits are initialized to represent the input embeddings, and the CNOT gates are used to entangle these qubits, effectively mixing the information across different dimensions. This quantum mixing step is crucial as it allows the model to capture intricate relationships between different parts of the input, such as the spatial configurations of atoms in a molecule. The resulting quantum states are then measured to obtain the attention scores, which are used to weight the value vectors and produce the final output. This process is fundamentally different from the classical approach, where the attention scores are derived from the squared dot products of query and key vectors, and it offers a more efficient and expressive way to handle complex data structures.

The practical implementation of QSAM involves several key steps, including the preparation of quantum states, the application of unitary transformations, and the measurement of the resulting states to extract attention scores. These steps are designed to be compatible with existing quantum hardware, making QSAM a promising direction for the development of next-generation transformer models. By integrating quantum computing with self-attention, QSAM not only enhances the model's performance on tasks requiring the processing of high-dimensional and structured data but also opens up new possibilities for the application of transformers in fields such as quantum chemistry and materials science [19]. The ability to efficiently handle large and complex datasets makes QSAM a valuable tool for advancing the state of the art in machine learning and quantum computing.

### 4.2.2 SMILES String Processing
SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings are a fundamental representation in computational chemistry, enabling the encoding of molecular structures into a linear format that can be easily processed by large language models (LLMs) [6]. The processing of SMILES strings involves several key steps, including tokenization, embedding, and transformation, each of which plays a crucial role in the model's ability to understand and manipulate chemical information. Tokenization is the first step, where SMILES strings are broken down into a sequence of tokens, such as atoms, bonds, and functional groups. This step is essential for converting the molecular structure into a form that can be processed by the model's self-attention mechanisms.

Once tokenized, each token is assigned an embedding, which captures its chemical and structural properties. These embeddings can be further enriched with positional information and physicochemical properties, such as atomic charges and bond lengths, to provide a more comprehensive representation of the molecule. The embeddings are then passed through the model's layers, where self-attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the molecule and capture long-range dependencies. This process is crucial for tasks such as molecular property prediction, reaction prediction, and synthesis planning, where the model needs to reason about the interactions between different parts of the molecule.

To enhance the model's performance, various techniques have been developed to improve the processing of SMILES strings. For example, some approaches use hybrid models that combine classical and quantum computing to compute attention scores, which can lead to more accurate and efficient molecular generation. Other methods focus on fine-tuning the model with task-specific data and tools, such as molecular property predictors and chemical databases, to improve its domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, the integration of multiple molecular views, such as 1D SMILES strings, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformers, into a unified textual space can further enhance the model's ability to reason about complex molecular structures [20].

### 4.2.3 Quantum-Computed Attention Scores
Quantum-computed attention scores represent a novel approach to enhancing the capabilities of machine learning models, particularly in the domain of molecular and materials science. By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, these scores aim to address the computational complexity associated with traditional attention mechanisms, which often become infeasible for large-scale chemical systems. Quantum computing offers a potential solution by enabling the efficient computation of attention scores through the manipulation of quantum states, thereby reducing the computational burden and improving the accuracy of predictions.

One of the key challenges in computing attention scores for molecular systems is the exponential growth in computational requirements as the size of the system increases. Quantum-computed attention scores mitigate this issue by utilizing quantum circuits to perform operations that are classically intractable. For instance, the use of learnable query and key states in a quantum circuit allows for the computation of the squared dot product, which serves as the attention score [19]. This approach not only accelerates the computation but also enhances the model's ability to capture long-range interactions and complex correlations within molecular structures. The integration of high-dimensional normalized representations in quantum self-attention mechanisms further amplifies these benefits, as it facilitates the movement of states across a hypersphere, leading to more robust and accurate predictions [19].

Recent advancements in quantum machine learning (QML) have explored various methods to compute attention scores, including the use of hybrid classical-quantum approaches [19]. These methods often involve the pre-processing of molecular data to generate quantum states, which are then used to compute attention scores through quantum circuits. Theoretical and empirical studies have demonstrated that such approaches can significantly improve the performance of models in tasks such as molecular property prediction and reaction mechanism analysis [21]. However, the practical implementation of these methods remains challenging due to the limitations of current quantum hardware, such as noise and decoherence. Despite these challenges, the potential of quantum-computed attention scores to revolutionize the field of computational chemistry is undeniable, and ongoing research continues to push the boundaries of what is possible with quantum computing.

## 4.3 Multimodal Alignment Frameworks

### 4.3.1 Multi-Query Transformer for Molecular Views
The Multi-Query Transformer (MQ-Former) for Molecular Views is a novel framework designed to integrate and align multiple molecular representations into a unified textual space, thereby enhancing the interpretability and performance of language models in molecular reasoning tasks [20]. This approach addresses the challenge of handling multi-modal data in chemistry, where molecular information can be represented in various forms, such as 1D SMILES strings, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformers [3]. By leveraging a multi-query transformer, MV-CLAM (Multi-View Contrastive Learning for Molecular Alignment) can effectively capture the intricate relationships between these different views, leading to more accurate and semantically rich molecular representations [20].

In MV-CLAM, the multi-query transformer is used to generate universal query tokens that can be aligned with both molecular and textual data. This alignment is achieved through a contrastive learning loss that considers all text tokens and enriches them with molecular query tokens. The framework ensures that each molecular view, whether it be a 1D sequence, 2D graph, or 3D structure, is represented in a way that preserves its unique characteristics while also allowing for seamless integration into a unified textual space. This unified representation is crucial for tasks such as molecule-text retrieval and molecule captioning, where the ability to accurately map between molecular structures and their textual descriptions is essential [20].

The effectiveness of MV-CLAM is demonstrated through its state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark tasks, including molecule-text retrieval and molecule captioning. The use of enriched molecular query tokens not only improves the accuracy of these tasks but also enhances the interpretability of the model's predictions. By aligning multiple molecular views in a unified space, MV-CLAM provides a robust framework for integrating diverse molecular data, thereby advancing the capabilities of language models in the field of chemistry. This approach opens up new possibilities for applications in drug discovery, materials science, and other areas where multi-modal molecular data is prevalent [3].

### 4.3.2 Fine-Grained Alignment and Contrastive Loss
Fine-grained alignment and contrastive loss have emerged as critical components in enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in chemistry-specific tasks [2]. Unlike general LLMs, which often struggle with the nuanced and complex nature of chemical data, fine-grained alignment ensures that the model can accurately map molecular structures to their corresponding textual descriptions [20]. This alignment is particularly important for tasks such as molecule captioning and text-based molecule generation, where the model must capture the detailed structural information of molecules [2]. By leveraging fine-grained alignment, LLMs can better understand and generate accurate descriptions of molecular properties, leading to improved performance in downstream applications.

Contrastive loss plays a pivotal role in fine-grained alignment by optimizing the model to distinguish between correct and incorrect alignments. In the context of chemistry, this involves training the model to identify the most relevant textual descriptions for a given molecular structure. For instance, when aligning a 2D molecular graph with a textual description, contrastive loss helps the model learn to select the most appropriate tokens that accurately represent the molecular features. This is achieved by minimizing the distance between the embeddings of the correct molecule-text pairs while maximizing the distance between incorrect pairs. This approach ensures that the model can effectively capture the intricate relationships between molecular structures and their textual representations, leading to more precise and contextually relevant outputs [20].

Recent advances in this area have shown that integrating fine-grained alignment with contrastive loss can significantly enhance the performance of LLMs in chemistry-related tasks. For example, models like GIT-MOL and InstructMol have demonstrated improved accuracy in generating molecular descriptions and predicting chemical reactions by leveraging these techniques [4]. By fine-tuning the models with structured and unstructured data from various sources, including molecular graphs and chemical literature, these approaches have shown the ability to capture the nuanced details of molecular structures and their properties. This integration not only improves the model's performance but also enhances its robustness and generalization capabilities, making it more suitable for a wide range of chemistry-specific applications.

### 4.3.3 Unified Textual Space Representation
Unified Textual Space Representation (UTSR) is a critical component in the integration of large language models (LLMs) with chemical data, enabling the seamless translation of molecular structures and properties into a coherent textual format. UTSR leverages advanced transformer architectures, such as the Multi-Querying Transformer (MQ-Former), to align molecular and textual representations in a shared embedding space [20]. This alignment is essential for tasks that require a deep understanding of both the structural and functional aspects of molecules, such as predicting chemical reactions, estimating physical properties, and generating molecular structures from textual descriptions.

In UTSR, molecular structures are first converted into textual representations using standardized formats like SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) or SELFIES (Self-Referencing Embedded Strings). These textual representations are then processed by the transformer model, which learns to map them into a high-dimensional embedding space. The key innovation in UTSR lies in the fine-grained alignment of these embeddings, ensuring that the contextual information from both the molecular structure and the textual description is preserved. This alignment is achieved through mechanisms such as attention layers, which allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence and capture intricate relationships between atoms and functional groups.

The practical implications of UTSR are significant, particularly in the areas of molecular property prediction and drug discovery. By representing molecules in a unified textual space, LLMs can leverage their extensive training on diverse datasets to perform complex reasoning tasks, such as predicting the reactivity of a compound or designing new molecules with desired properties [3]. Moreover, UTSR facilitates the integration of external knowledge sources, such as chemical databases and scientific literature, enhancing the model's ability to reason about chemical concepts and make informed predictions. This approach not only improves the accuracy and reliability of LLMs in chemical applications but also paves the way for more sophisticated and domain-specific models tailored to the unique challenges of chemistry [3].

# 5 Development and Assessment of Multimodal LLMs

## 5.1 Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards

### 5.1.1 Algorithm Design for Reward Verification
In the context of reward verification for Large Language Models (LLMs), the algorithm design must address the dual challenges of ensuring the accuracy of the model’s responses and evaluating the quality of the generated questions. The primary goal is to develop a robust framework that can effectively assess the model’s ability to generate thoughtful and relevant questions, particularly in the context of curiosity-driven question generation (CDQG) [22]. This involves designing algorithms that can dynamically evaluate the model’s outputs against a set of predefined criteria, such as the relevance, depth, and novelty of the questions.

To achieve this, the reward verification algorithm must incorporate a multi-faceted evaluation process. This process typically includes a combination of automated and human evaluation methods. Automated methods can involve natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the syntactic and semantic structure of the questions, as well as machine learning models trained to predict the quality of the questions based on historical data. For instance, the algorithm can use text similarity metrics to assess the relevance of the questions to the given statement and identify whether the questions are aligned with the core concepts and key knowledge points. Additionally, the algorithm can employ logical reasoning models to evaluate the depth and coherence of the questions, ensuring that they probe the statement from multiple angles and encourage critical thinking.

Human evaluation remains a crucial component of the reward verification process, as it provides a nuanced and context-sensitive assessment of the questions. This involves a panel of domain experts who can provide qualitative feedback on the questions, rating them based on criteria such as clarity, originality, and the extent to which they challenge the model’s understanding of the statement. The human evaluation can also help identify any biases or inconsistencies in the model’s outputs, which may not be apparent through automated methods alone. By integrating both automated and human evaluation, the reward verification algorithm can provide a comprehensive and balanced assessment of the model’s performance, facilitating the continuous improvement of the LLM’s questioning abilities [22].

### 5.1.2 Experimental Validation in Simulations
In the experimental validation phase, simulations were conducted to rigorously assess the performance of various models across a diverse set of scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, and mathematics. The dataset, comprising 1101 statements, was meticulously curated to include a range of difficulties and a special section dedicated to erroneous statements, designed to test the models' critical inquiry skills [22]. This setup allowed us to evaluate not only the models' ability to provide correct answers but also their capacity to identify and question incorrect information, a crucial aspect of scientific reasoning.

The simulations involved a comprehensive comparison of models, from smaller architectures like Phi-2 to larger, more sophisticated models such as GPT-4 and Gemini. The results revealed that while larger models generally excelled in coherence and relevance, smaller models like Phi-2 demonstrated comparable or even superior performance in certain areas, particularly in critical inquiry. This finding suggests that model size is not the sole determinant of knowledge acquisition and reasoning capabilities. Instead, the quality of training data and the effectiveness of the model's architecture in processing and integrating this data play significant roles.

To ensure the robustness of our evaluation, we introduced a dynamic evaluation method that simulates real-world scenarios where models must adapt to new information and changing contexts. This approach highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each model, particularly in handling complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. For instance, models trained with reasoning-related data, such as Gemini2.0-flash-thinking and QVQ-72B, performed notably better under dynamic conditions [23]. These findings underscore the importance of developing evaluation frameworks that go beyond static benchmarks to provide a more nuanced understanding of model capabilities in scientific reasoning.

### 5.1.3 Real-World Application Demonstrations
Real-world application demonstrations of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been pivotal in showcasing their capabilities and limitations across various domains [24]. One notable application is in the field of education, particularly in early childhood science education (ECSE). MLLMs have been utilized to generate educational content tailored for young learners, integrating textual, visual, and interactive elements to enhance learning experiences. For instance, models like Gemini and Claude-2 have been evaluated for their ability to create engaging and age-appropriate content, with human evaluations indicating that these models can produce relevant and feasible educational materials. However, the unique linguistic and cognitive needs of preschool children pose significant challenges, necessitating further refinement of these models to better meet educational standards [25].

Another critical application domain is scientific reasoning, where MLLMs are being tested on their ability to handle complex, multimodal problems [24]. The introduction of benchmarks like VisScience and EMMA has provided a more comprehensive evaluation framework, integrating both textual and visual information to assess the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs across disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry [26]. These benchmarks have revealed that while models like GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5-Pro perform well in specific areas, there is still room for improvement in cross-modal reasoning tasks. For example, GPT-4o excels in physics with a 38.2% accuracy, but struggles with the visual and textual integration required for more complex problems.

In practical settings, the application of MLLMs to real-world problems has also been explored in the context of teacher support and student feedback [23]. Models are being used to assist teachers in grading subjective questions, which often require both textual and visual responses [27]. This application is particularly relevant in high-stakes educational environments where the student-to-teacher ratio is high, making it challenging for teachers to provide detailed feedback. By automating the grading process, MLLMs can help alleviate the workload on teachers and provide students with immediate, constructive feedback. However, the effectiveness of these models in this context is still under investigation, with ongoing research focusing on improving the accuracy and reliability of automated grading systems.

## 5.2 Narrative Integration in LLMs

### 5.2.1 Story of Thought Method
The Story of Thought (SoT) method represents a novel approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging narrative structures [28]. Unlike traditional prompting techniques that rely on linear sequences of instructions, SoT integrates elements of storytelling to guide the model through the reasoning process [28]. This method is designed to help LLMs better understand and organize complex information, making it particularly useful for tasks that require deep cognitive processing and the integration of multiple pieces of information. By framing the reasoning process within a narrative, SoT aims to improve the model's ability to identify relevant information, establish logical connections, and generate coherent solutions.

In practice, the SoT method involves constructing prompts that are structured as stories or narratives, where the problem to be solved is embedded within a broader context. This narrative context provides a framework that helps the LLM to better grasp the underlying concepts and relationships involved in the task. For example, when applied to a complex mathematical problem, the SoT method might present the problem as part of a story about a character facing a real-world challenge that requires mathematical reasoning to solve. This approach not only makes the problem more relatable and engaging but also helps the LLM to contextualize the information and apply it more effectively. The narrative structure can include characters, settings, and plot elements that serve to highlight key aspects of the problem and guide the reasoning process.

The effectiveness of the SoT method has been evaluated on several benchmark datasets, including GPQA and JEEBench, which contain complex problems that require advanced reasoning skills. Results from these evaluations demonstrate that SoT significantly outperforms traditional prompting techniques, particularly in tasks that involve multiple steps and require the integration of diverse information sources. The narrative-based approach appears to enhance the LLM's ability to reason through complex scenarios by providing a more intuitive and structured way of organizing information [28]. Furthermore, the SoT method has shown promise in generating more coherent and contextually appropriate explanations, which can be valuable for educational and explanatory purposes.

### 5.2.2 Performance on Complex Problems
In evaluating the performance of various large language models (LLMs) on complex problems, we focus on a dataset comprising 1101 statements from physics, chemistry, and mathematics, with a special emphasis on erroneous statements to test the models' critical inquiry skills [22]. The dataset is designed to challenge the models' ability to handle a wide range of difficulties, from basic to advanced, and to assess their reasoning capabilities in a controlled yet comprehensive manner. Our evaluation includes models such as Phi-2, Gemini, Claude-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, each representing different scales and architectures.

The results indicate that while larger models like GPT-4 and Gemini generally excel in coherence and relevance, smaller models like Phi-2 demonstrate comparable or even superior performance in certain areas, particularly in critical reasoning tasks [22]. This suggests that model size is not the sole determinant of reasoning ability, and that other factors, such as training data diversity and fine-tuning techniques, play a crucial role. The dynamic evaluation setting, which introduces more complex and real-world scenarios, further reveals the limitations of existing benchmarks, which often lack the depth and breadth necessary to fully assess the reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs.

To address these limitations, we propose a fine-grained assessment matrix that evaluates LLMs across five core competencies: Knowledge, Understanding, Reasoning, Multimodality, and Values, with 16 sub-dimensions [29]. This matrix is applied to a benchmark suite covering multiple scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, life sciences, and earth and space sciences. The benchmark is designed to systematically compare over 20 representative models, ensuring a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of their performance on complex problems. Our findings highlight the need for improved multimodal architectures and training paradigms to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in handling intricate, real-world tasks.

### 5.2.3 Impact of Narrative Techniques
Narrative techniques play a pivotal role in enhancing the comprehension and retention of complex subjects, particularly when integrated into the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs). By structuring information within a story, these techniques provide a coherent and engaging framework that aligns with human cognitive processes [28]. Unlike simple fact listing, which can be overwhelming and difficult to retain, narratives offer a structured sequence of events that helps users connect new information with existing knowledge, thereby facilitating better understanding and recall. This is particularly evident in domains such as science communication, where complex concepts are often abstract and challenging to grasp. Narratives can break down these concepts into relatable scenarios, making them more accessible and memorable.

Moreover, narrative techniques can significantly improve the reasoning abilities of LLMs by providing a context-rich environment that mimics real-world problem-solving scenarios [28]. When LLMs are prompted with narrative-based questions or tasks, they are required to not only retrieve and process information but also to infer relationships and causality within the story [28]. This process of contextual reasoning is more demanding than straightforward information retrieval and can lead to more sophisticated and nuanced responses. For instance, in educational settings, narrative-driven questions that require students to explain a scientific phenomenon through a story can promote deeper cognitive engagement and critical thinking. Such questions often demand a combination of textual and visual elements, further enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

In addition to improving comprehension and reasoning, narrative techniques can also enhance the emotional and motivational aspects of learning and communication. Stories have the power to evoke emotions and create a personal connection with the material, which can increase user engagement and motivation. This is particularly important in fields such as health communication, where the emotional impact of a message can influence behavior change. By incorporating narrative techniques, LLMs can generate content that is not only informative but also compelling and persuasive. Overall, the integration of narrative techniques into LLM outputs represents a promising direction for advancing the capabilities of these models in various applications, from education and science communication to health and beyond.

## 5.3 Multimodal Reasoning Benchmarks

### 5.3.1 EMMA Benchmark for Cross-Modal Reasoning
The EMMA (Enhanced MultiModal reAsoning) benchmark is designed to evaluate the advanced cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across scientific domains, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, and coding [30]. Unlike traditional benchmarks that often focus on text-dominant reasoning or rely on shallow visual cues, EMMA tasks require models to integrate and reason over both textual and visual information in a cohesive manner. This benchmark consists of 1101 statements, carefully curated to span a range of difficulty levels, from basic understanding to complex problem-solving. Notably, the dataset includes a section of erroneous statements, which are specifically designed to test the models' critical inquiry skills and their ability to detect and correct logical inconsistencies.

In the evaluation of various MLLMs, including smaller models like Phi-2 and larger models like GPT-4 and Gemini, the EMMA benchmark reveals that model size is not the sole determinant of reasoning performance. While larger models generally excel in coherence and relevance, smaller models like Phi-2 demonstrate comparable or even superior performance in certain tasks, suggesting that architectural design and training paradigms play a crucial role in enhancing cross-modal reasoning capabilities. The benchmark also highlights significant limitations in handling complex multimodal and multi-step reasoning tasks, even with advanced techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and test-time compute scaling [23]. These findings underscore the need for more sophisticated multimodal architectures and training methods to bridge the gap between human and model reasoning in multimodal contexts [30].

The EMMA benchmark further emphasizes the importance of a dynamic evaluation framework that can adapt to the evolving capabilities of MLLMs. This framework includes techniques such as textual bootstrapping (e.g., word substitution, paraphrasing) and visual bootstrapping (e.g., image expansion, color shift, style transfer) to generate bootstrapped unseen data. By incorporating these dynamic elements, the EMMA benchmark provides a more robust and fair platform for assessing the high-order reasoning abilities of MLLMs [23]. The benchmark's comprehensive coverage of multiple scientific disciplines and its focus on integrated visual and textual reasoning make it a valuable tool for researchers and developers aiming to push the boundaries of multimodal reasoning in AI [30].

### 5.3.2 VisScience Benchmark for Scientific Reasoning
The VisScience benchmark is a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess the scientific reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across multiple scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, and mathematics [26]. This benchmark addresses the limitations of existing datasets by integrating both textual and visual information, thereby providing a more realistic and challenging environment for evaluating MLLMs [26]. The dataset comprises 1101 statements, each carefully curated to span a wide range of difficulty levels, from basic concepts to advanced topics. Notably, a special section of erroneous statements is included to test the models' critical inquiry skills, ensuring that they can identify and correct logical fallacies and misconceptions.

In the evaluation, we assess a diverse set of models, ranging from smaller architectures like Phi-2 to larger, more powerful models such as GPT-4 and Gemini. Our findings reveal that while larger models generally perform well in terms of coherence and relevance, smaller models like Phi-2 demonstrate comparable or even superior performance in specific tasks, suggesting that model size is not the sole determinant of reasoning ability. This observation underscores the importance of model architecture and training data in fostering robust scientific reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, the inclusion of questions that require higher-order reasoning, such as identifying knowledge gaps and exploring alternative viewpoints, highlights the necessity of structured reasoning approaches, like the "chain of thought" method used by some models [22].

The VisScience benchmark also emphasizes the role of fine-grained annotations and detailed answer explanations, which are crucial for providing a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' reasoning processes [26]. These annotations include difficulty levels, key knowledge points, and step-by-step reasoning breakdowns, enabling a nuanced assessment of model performance. The benchmark's cross-disciplinary nature and multimodal design make it a valuable resource for researchers aiming to develop and refine MLLMs that can effectively handle complex scientific reasoning tasks [24]. By providing a standardized and rigorous evaluation framework, VisScience facilitates the identification of strengths and weaknesses in current models, guiding future research and development in this critical area.

### 5.3.3 Comprehensive Evaluation of MLLMs
Comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for understanding their capabilities and limitations in complex reasoning tasks [24]. Traditional evaluation methods, which primarily focus on language understanding and generation, fall short in assessing the nuanced reasoning and problem-solving abilities required in scientific and technical domains. To address this gap, we propose a multifaceted evaluation framework that integrates both quantitative and qualitative assessments. This framework includes benchmarks that test the models' ability to handle multimodal inputs, perform cross-domain reasoning, and generate novel hypotheses or solutions. By evaluating models across a diverse range of tasks, such as mathematical problem-solving, scientific hypothesis generation, and interdisciplinary knowledge integration, we aim to provide a more holistic view of their strengths and weaknesses.

In our evaluation, we consider a variety of MLLMs, including both closed-source models like GPT-4 and Gemini, and open-source alternatives like Phi-2 and Claude-2. Our results indicate that while larger models generally exhibit higher coherence and relevance in their outputs, smaller models can perform comparably well in specific tasks, suggesting that model size is not the sole determinant of performance. We also find that the integration of visual and textual data significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities, particularly in tasks requiring the interpretation of complex scientific concepts. However, the lack of fine-grained annotations and structured knowledge in current benchmarks limits the depth of these evaluations, highlighting the need for more sophisticated and comprehensive assessment tools.

To further refine our understanding of MLLMs' potential in scientific discovery, we conduct a detailed analysis of their performance in generating research ideas across five domains: Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry, Economics, and Medicine [24]. Using a dataset of recent research papers, we evaluate the novelty, relevance, and feasibility of the ideas generated by the models. Our findings suggest that MLLMs can indeed produce relevant and feasible research directions, though the quality and originality of these ideas vary [24]. This variability underscores the importance of developing more robust evaluation metrics that can accurately capture the models' ability to synthesize existing knowledge and generate innovative insights. Additionally, the involvement of domain experts in the evaluation process helps ensure that the generated ideas are not only technically sound but also aligned with current research trends and practical considerations.

# 6 Future Directions
