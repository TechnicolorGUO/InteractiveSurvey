# 2 Introduction
The field of drug discovery has been revolutionized by the advent of advanced computational methods, particularly generative artificial intelligence (AI) [1]. Traditional approaches to drug design, which often rely on high-throughput screening and empirical methods, are time-consuming and resource-intensive. The integration of generative AI models has opened new avenues for accelerating the drug discovery process by enabling the de novo design of novel molecules with desired properties [2]. These models can generate large libraries of potential drug candidates, predict their binding affinities, and optimize them for various physicochemical and pharmacological properties. However, the complexity and multidimensionality of the chemical space, coupled with the need for computational efficiency and accuracy, pose significant challenges that require innovative solutions.

This survey paper focuses on the application of generative AI models in drug design, specifically highlighting recent advancements and key techniques that have emerged in this domain [3]. The paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art, discussing the strengths and limitations of various generative models and their potential impact on the drug discovery pipeline [3]. It covers a wide range of models, including generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), flow-based models, and generative flow networks (GFlowNets), and explores their applications in molecular and protein design [4]. The survey also delves into the integration of these models with other computational tools and experimental techniques, emphasizing the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in advancing the field.

The content of this survey is organized to cover several key areas. First, it examines advanced generative models for protein and molecular design, including enhanced generative adversarial networks (GANs) with modified loss functions, non-equivariant denoising networks, and the integration of pretrained random forest classifiers [4]. These models are discussed in the context of their ability to improve selectivity, computational efficiency, and the quality of generated molecules. The survey then explores flow-based and diffusion models, such as CRYOFM for cryo-EM density maps, Best-of-K Diffusion Alignment for optimizing molecular properties, and Generative Fractional Diffusion Models for protein design [5]. These models are evaluated for their capacity to capture complex data distributions and generate high-quality, biologically relevant structures.

Next, the survey delves into variational autoencoders (VAEs) and GFlowNets, focusing on semi-supervised graph-to-string VAEs, divergence measures for GFlowNets, and equivariant consistency models. These models are discussed in terms of their ability to handle mixed data types, optimize training efficiency, and maintain the structural and functional properties of generated molecules. The survey also covers synthesis-oriented and property-optimized molecular generation, including pharmacophore-based models like SynthFormer, 3D molecule generation with E3WAE, and scaffold hopping with TurboHopp [1]. These models are evaluated for their effectiveness in generating molecules that are not only structurally valid but also synthesizable and optimized for specific properties [6].

Finally, the survey explores integrative approaches for structure-based drug design, including multi-task learning and docking methods such as FABFlex, IDOLpro, and FlowDock. These approaches are discussed in the context of their ability to predict and optimize protein-ligand interactions, as well as their integration with language models and hybrid approaches like DrugGen, Fragment Retrieval-Augmented Generation (f-RAG), and Collaborative Intelligence Drug Design (CIDD) [7]. The survey also touches on the integration of protein dynamics and cross-modal models, such as DYNAMICFLOW and Chem42, which are designed to capture the dynamic nature of protein-ligand interactions and generate target-specific ligands [8].

The contributions of this survey paper are multifaceted. It provides a comprehensive review of the latest generative AI models and techniques in drug design, offering insights into their strengths, limitations, and potential applications [3]. The paper also highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, integrating computational methods with experimental validation to advance the field. By synthesizing the current state of the art and identifying key areas for future research, this survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders in the drug discovery community.

# 3 Advanced Generative Models for Protein and Molecular Design

## 3.1 Enhanced Generative Adversarial Networks

### 3.1.1 Modified Loss Functions for Selectivity
Modified loss functions play a crucial role in enhancing the selectivity of generative models, particularly in the context of diffusion models. These models typically rely on a forward process that gradually adds noise to the data, followed by a reverse process that denoises the data to generate new samples [9]. The standard loss function used in these models, such as the mean squared error (MSE), may not always be sufficient to capture the intricate details and specific characteristics of the data, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this, researchers have proposed various modified loss functions that incorporate additional terms to improve selectivity and fidelity.

One such approach involves the use of categorical cross-entropy (CCE) loss, which is particularly effective for discrete data such as molecular structures. In this context, the loss function is designed to penalize the model for incorrect predictions of atom types and bond types at each step of the denoising process. The overall loss is a weighted sum of the reconstruction losses for atom types and bond types, with weights \( \gamma_v \) and \( \gamma_b \) respectively [10]. This ensures that the model not only reconstructs the overall structure accurately but also maintains the correct chemical properties of the generated molecules. By carefully tuning these weights, the model can be made more selective in generating molecules that meet specific criteria, such as desired functional groups or pharmacological properties.

Another modification involves the use of f-divergence measures, such as the reverse and forward KL divergences, which are known for their ability to capture the distributional differences between the generated and target data. These divergences are particularly useful in scenarios where the target distribution is sparse or has complex structures. By minimizing these divergences during training, the model can better align the generated data with the target distribution, leading to improved selectivity and sample quality. Empirical evaluations have shown that these modified loss functions often accelerate training and result in more stable and accurate generative models, making them a valuable tool in the development of advanced generative models for various applications.

### 3.1.2 Non-Equivariant Denoising Networks
Non-equivariant denoising networks represent a significant departure from the traditional equivariant architectures commonly employed in generative models, particularly in the context of diffusion models. These networks do not enforce symmetry constraints, allowing them to capture a broader range of data distributions and patterns. Unlike equivariant models, which are designed to maintain specific symmetries (such as rotational or translational invariance) throughout the denoising process, non-equivariant networks can adapt more flexibly to the complexities of the data. This flexibility is particularly advantageous in scenarios where the data does not exhibit clear or consistent symmetries, or where the symmetries are too complex to be effectively captured by current equivariant architectures.

One of the key benefits of non-equivariant denoising networks is their computational efficiency. By removing the need for specialized operations like group convolutions or spherical harmonics, these networks can significantly reduce inference time and computational resources. This efficiency is crucial for large-scale applications, such as generating high-resolution images or complex molecular structures, where computational constraints can be a significant bottleneck. Furthermore, the lack of symmetry constraints allows non-equivariant networks to potentially achieve higher sample quality, as they are not limited by the expressivity constraints inherent to equivariant models. This has been empirically demonstrated in various studies, where non-equivariant denoising networks have outperformed their equivariant counterparts in terms of both sample quality and diversity.

However, the flexibility and efficiency of non-equivariant denoising networks come with their own set of challenges. One major challenge is ensuring that the network can generalize well to unseen data, especially in tasks where symmetry is a critical feature of the data distribution. To address this, researchers have explored the use of learned canonicalizers, which preprocess the input data to align it with a canonical form before feeding it into the denoising network. This approach helps to mitigate the lack of built-in symmetry constraints, allowing the network to focus on learning the essential features of the data. Despite these challenges, non-equivariant denoising networks remain a promising direction for advancing generative modeling, particularly in applications where computational efficiency and sample quality are paramount.

### 3.1.3 Pretrained Random Forest Classifiers
Pretrained Random Forest Classifiers (RFs) have emerged as a valuable tool in enhancing the performance of generative models, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or imbalanced. RFs, due to their ensemble nature, offer robustness and interpretability, making them suitable for use as auxiliary discriminators in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In this context, the integration of a pretrained RF classifier into the SeqGAN framework aims to improve the quality and stability of SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) generation. By leveraging the RF's ability to capture complex patterns and provide reliable class probabilities, the SeqGAN can better distinguish between real and generated molecular sequences, thereby refining the adversarial training process.

To further enhance the stability and effectiveness of the adversarial training, the proposed architecture incorporates Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) pretraining for the generator and Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) [11]. MLE pretraining initializes the generator with a good starting point, reducing the risk of mode collapse and improving the convergence of the GAN. WGANs, on the other hand, address the vanishing gradient problem often encountered in traditional GANs by using the Wasserstein distance as the loss function. This combination ensures that the generator receives meaningful gradients throughout the training process, leading to more stable and high-quality molecular sequence generation.

The integration of a pretrained RF classifier as an auxiliary discriminator not only improves the quality of generated SMILES but also addresses the challenge of dataset imbalances, which are common in molecular datasets. By providing additional supervision signals, the RF helps the GAN focus on the most relevant features of the data, thereby enhancing the model's ability to generalize and generate diverse and valid molecular structures. This approach has shown promise in various molecular generation tasks, including de novo drug design and lead optimization, where the ability to generate novel and diverse compounds is crucial [12]. Overall, the synergy between sequence-based GANs and pretrained RF classifiers offers a powerful framework for advancing molecular generative modeling in low-data regimes [11].

## 3.2 Flow-Based and Diffusion Models

### 3.2.1 CRYOFM for Cryo-EM Density Maps
CRYOFM, or Cryo-EM Flow Matching, represents a significant advancement in the field of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) by leveraging flow-based generative models to improve the quality and interpretability of cryo-EM density maps [13]. Unlike traditional methods that rely on hand-crafted heuristics or empirical adjustments, CRYOFM employs a data-driven approach to learn the underlying distribution of high-quality density maps directly from experimental data. This is achieved through a flow-based generative model that maps a simple prior distribution to the complex distribution of cryo-EM density maps, enabling the generation of realistic and high-resolution maps [13].

The core innovation of CRYOFM lies in its ability to derive a flow posterior sampling algorithm, which allows the model to be effectively utilized as a prior for various downstream tasks [13]. This algorithm facilitates the generation of density maps that are consistent with the observed data while also incorporating prior knowledge about the expected structure and quality of the maps. By doing so, CRYOFM not only enhances the resolution and clarity of the maps but also provides a principled framework for integrating additional constraints or prior information, such as known structural motifs or biochemical properties. This capability is particularly valuable in the context of cryo-EM, where the quality of the density maps can significantly impact the accuracy of subsequent structural analyses and interpretations.

In an unsupervised manner, CRYOFM demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving better results in several key metrics, including map resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and structural fidelity. The model's effectiveness is further enhanced by its ability to handle the inherent variability and noise present in cryo-EM data, making it a robust tool for both routine and challenging cryo-EM applications. Overall, CRYOFM represents a foundational model that can be leveraged to address more complex problems in cryo-EM and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), thereby advancing the field of structural biology and facilitating the discovery of new insights into macromolecular structures and functions.

### 3.2.2 Best-of-K Diffusion Alignment
In the context of molecular generative models, the Best-of-K Diffusion Alignment (BoKDiff) framework represents a significant advancement by integrating reward ranking and fine-tuning to optimize molecular properties [14]. This method leverages the inherent flexibility of diffusion models to generate high-quality molecular structures while ensuring that the generated molecules meet specific criteria, such as drug-likeness, synthesizability, and docking scores. BoKDiff operates by first generating a large set of candidate molecules through the diffusion process, which are then ranked based on a reward function that evaluates the desired properties. The top K candidates are selected and used to fine-tune the diffusion model, thereby iteratively improving the model's ability to generate molecules with the desired characteristics.

The BoKDiff framework addresses the challenge of optimizing multiple molecular properties simultaneously, which is crucial for applications in drug discovery and materials science. By using a reward-based selection process, BoKDiff ensures that the generated molecules not only have high-quality structural features but also meet specific functional requirements. This is particularly important in scenarios where the optimization of a single property might lead to suboptimal results. For instance, a molecule with high drug-likeness but poor synthesizability would be of limited practical value. The iterative fine-tuning process in BoKDiff allows the model to learn from the most successful candidates, gradually shifting the generated distribution towards the desired region of the chemical space.

Moreover, BoKDiff enhances the efficiency of the generative process by focusing computational resources on the most promising candidates. This is achieved through the use of a reward ranking mechanism that efficiently filters out low-reward molecules, reducing the computational burden of fine-tuning. The method also maintains the diversity of the generated molecules, which is essential for exploring the vast chemical space and discovering novel structures. By balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, BoKDiff provides a robust and scalable solution for molecular generative tasks, making it a valuable tool in the arsenal of computational chemists and biologists.

### 3.2.3 Generative Fractional Diffusion Models
Generative Fractional Diffusion Models (GFDMs) represent a significant advancement in the field of generative modeling, particularly in the context of protein design [5]. Unlike traditional diffusion models that rely on Brownian motion (BM) as the underlying stochastic process, GFDMs incorporate fractional Brownian motion (fBm) to capture long-range dependencies and super-diffusive behavior [4]. This mathematical framework allows for more expressive and controllable generative dynamics, making GFDMs particularly suitable for tasks that require modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions. The use of fBm introduces a new level of flexibility, enabling the model to better represent the intricate and often non-Markovian nature of biological systems.

In the context of protein design, the ProT-GFDM model leverages the mathematical properties of fBm to generate protein sequences that not only adhere to the syntactic rules of SMILES notation but also capture the structural and functional features of the proteins. This is achieved by defining a new metric on the ambient space \( \mathbb{R}^d \) using pullback geometry, which preserves the geometric structure of the data manifold \( D \) on the latent manifold \( M \) [15]. The learned isometry \( \varphi \) ensures that the generative process respects the intrinsic geometry of the protein data, leading to more biologically meaningful and diverse protein designs. The model's ability to integrate with both stochastic and deterministic solvers, such as SDE and ODE solvers, further enhances its applicability and efficiency in generating high-quality protein structures.

The sampling methods in GFDMs are crucial for the practical implementation and performance of the model. These methods include the use of SDE solvers to simulate the forward diffusion process and ODE solvers to reverse the diffusion and generate samples. The integration of these solvers with the fractional diffusion framework allows for efficient and accurate sampling, even in high-dimensional spaces. Additionally, the use of Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM) on the latent manifold \( M \) supports interpolation and ensures that the generated samples remain within the feasible region of the data manifold [15]. This approach not only improves the quality of the generated proteins but also reduces the computational complexity, making GFDMs a powerful tool for advancing generative protein design.

## 3.3 Variational Autoencoders and GFlowNets

### 3.3.1 Semi-Supervised Graph-2-String VAE
Semi-Supervised Graph-2-String Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) represent a significant advancement in the field of molecular generative models, particularly for tasks involving the design of complex polymers and proteins [16]. These models integrate the strengths of graph-based representations with the flexibility of string-based encodings, allowing for a more comprehensive capture of both structural and functional properties. The semi-supervised nature of these VAEs enables them to effectively leverage partially labeled data, which is often more readily available in real-world scenarios compared to fully annotated datasets. This is achieved by augmenting the traditional VAE framework with a semi-supervised learning component that can handle both labeled and unlabeled data during training, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize and generate high-quality outputs.

The core architecture of a Semi-Supervised Graph-2-String VAE consists of an encoder that maps the input molecular graph into a latent space, followed by a decoder that reconstructs the molecular structure as a string representation, such as SMILES. The encoder-decoder framework is enhanced with a semi-supervised loss function that includes terms for both labeled and unlabeled data. For labeled data, the model is trained to minimize the reconstruction error and the KL divergence between the learned latent distribution and a prior distribution. For unlabeled data, the model leverages a consistency regularization term that encourages the latent representations of similar inputs to be close to each other, thus preserving the structural and functional relationships within the data. This dual training mechanism ensures that the model can effectively learn from the available labeled data while still benefiting from the additional information contained in the unlabeled data.

In practice, the semi-supervised Graph-2-String VAE has demonstrated superior performance in generating novel and valid molecular structures compared to fully supervised or unsupervised VAEs. The ability to handle mixed data types and the integration of graph and string representations make it particularly well-suited for tasks such as de novo protein design and polymer synthesis, where the structural complexity and functional diversity of the molecules are crucial. Additionally, the model's flexibility in handling partial labels allows for more efficient data utilization, making it a valuable tool in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. Overall, the semi-supervised Graph-2-String VAE represents a robust and versatile approach to molecular generative modeling, bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications in the field of chemical and biological sciences.

### 3.3.2 Divergence Measures for GFlowNets
Divergence measures play a crucial role in the training of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), providing a principled way to optimize the model parameters to match the target distribution. Among the various divergence measures, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, Renyi-α divergence, and Tsallis-α divergence have been extensively evaluated for their effectiveness in GFlowNets. The forward KL divergence, which measures the difference between the model distribution and the target distribution, is commonly used due to its straightforward interpretation and ease of implementation. However, the reverse KL divergence, which measures the difference in the opposite direction, can sometimes lead to more stable training dynamics and better sample quality, especially in high-dimensional spaces.

To further enhance the training efficiency and performance of GFlowNets, control variates (CVs) have been designed to reduce the variance of the gradient estimators [17]. These CVs are constructed to be correlated with the original gradient estimators but have lower variance, thereby accelerating the convergence of the optimization process. The use of CVs in conjunction with divergence-based objectives has been shown to significantly reduce the variance of the estimators, leading to faster and more stable training. This approach leverages the strengths of automatic differentiation frameworks, enabling efficient and scalable computation of the gradients required for optimization.

Empirical evaluations have demonstrated that divergence measures, particularly the forward and reverse KL- divergences, Renyi-α, and Tsallis-α divergences, often outperform traditional loss functions in GFlowNets [17]. The choice of divergence measure can significantly impact the quality of the generated samples and the overall training dynamics. For instance, the Renyi-α divergence, with its adjustable α parameter, provides a flexible trade-off between bias and variance, making it suitable for different stages of training. Similarly, the Tsallis-α divergence, known for its non-extensive properties, can help in capturing long-tail distributions, which are common in many generative tasks. These findings underscore the importance of carefully selecting and tuning divergence measures to achieve optimal performance in GFlowNets [17].

### 3.3.3 Equivariant Consistency Models
Equivariant Consistency Models (ECMs) represent a significant advancement in the field of generative modeling, particularly in scenarios where the data exhibits symmetries. These models are designed to be invariant or equivariant to specific transformations, such as rotations, translations, and permutations, which are common in physical and biological systems [18]. By incorporating these symmetries, ECMs can achieve more efficient and accurate learning, as they generalize better across different orientations and configurations of the data. This is particularly crucial in applications such as molecular generative tasks, where the structural properties of molecules are invariant to rotations and translations.

The key idea behind ECMs is to leverage the mathematical structure of the data manifold to ensure that the learned generative model respects the underlying symmetries. This is achieved through the use of equivariant operations, such as group convolutions and spherical harmonics, which are designed to maintain the equivariance property throughout the model. For instance, in the context of molecular generative models, SE(3)-equivariant operations ensure that the generated molecular structures are consistent with the physical symmetries of the atoms and bonds. This not only improves the quality of the generated samples but also reduces the number of parameters required to achieve high performance, as the model does not need to learn redundant transformations.

Despite their advantages, ECMs face several challenges. One major issue is the computational complexity associated with equivariant operations, which can be significantly more expensive than their non-equivariant counterparts. This is particularly true for operations involving higher-dimensional symmetries, such as spherical harmonics, which require extensive computational resources. Additionally, the expressivity of equivariant models can be limited, as they are constrained to functions that respect the specified symmetries [18]. This may restrict their ability to capture more complex patterns in the data, especially in scenarios where the symmetries are not strictly adhered to. Nevertheless, the benefits of equivariance in terms of sample efficiency and generalization make ECMs a promising direction for future research in generative modeling.

# 4 Synthesis-Oriented and Property-Optimized Molecular Generation

## 4.1 Synthesis-Aware Generative Models

### 4.1.1 SynthFormer for Pharmacophore-Based Molecules
SynthFormer represents a significant advancement in the field of pharmacophore-based molecular design by integrating 3D pharmacophore information with synthesis-aware generation [1]. Unlike traditional approaches that often rely on 1D sequences or 2D graphs, SynthFormer employs a 3D equivariant encoder to capture the spatial relationships and interactions between pharmacophoric features [1]. This allows the model to generate molecules that not only match the desired pharmacophore constraints but also maintain realistic 3D conformations, which are crucial for accurate binding predictions and subsequent biological activity [14].

The core innovation of SynthFormer lies in its Synthesis-Aware Decoder, which constructs molecules as synthetic trees, ensuring that each generated molecule is not only structurally valid but also synthesizable [6]. By formulating the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), SynthFormer can iteratively assemble molecules from a library of purchasable building blocks and reaction templates [19]. This approach addresses the common issue of generating molecules that lie outside the synthetically accessible chemical space, a problem that has plagued many generative models [6]. The model's ability to generate synthetic pathways alongside the final molecules provides a clear roadmap for chemists, facilitating the practical realization of the designed compounds [6].

In validation studies, SynthFormer has demonstrated its effectiveness in generating molecules with high docking scores for a variety of protein targets, indicating its potential for identifying potent ligands in the early stages of drug discovery [20]. Moreover, the model's flexibility in handling different pharmacophore representations and its robust performance across various protein families suggest its broad applicability. The integration of 3D pharmacophore information and synthesis-aware generation in SynthFormer marks a promising step towards more efficient and practical de novo molecular design [1].

### 4.1.2 E3WAE for 3D Molecule Generation
E3WAE, or Equivariant Wasserstein Autoencoder, is a recent advancement in the field of 3D molecule generation, designed to address the limitations of sequential generation methods that often lead to inaccurate and unreasonable 3D molecular structures [21]. Unlike traditional methods that generate atoms and bonds sequentially, E3WAE operates in a latent space where it learns the joint distributions of all atoms within the 3D pocket simultaneously. This approach ensures that the position and element type of each atom are influenced by the entire molecular structure, leading to more stable and accurate 3D configurations.

The core of E3WAE lies in its ability to maintain E(3)-equivariance, which ensures that the generated molecular structures are invariant to translations, rotations, and reflections. This property is crucial for generating realistic 3D molecules, as it aligns with the physical principles governing molecular interactions [21]. By operating in the latent space, E3WAE can efficiently capture the complex dependencies between atoms, leading to a more coherent and chemically plausible representation of the molecule. The model uses a denoising diffusion process to generate the latent states, which are then decoded into 3D coordinates, ensuring that the generated molecules are not only structurally valid but also optimized for specific properties such as binding affinity.

Despite its advantages, E3WAE faces challenges in incorporating chemical bond information during the training process, which can result in unrealistic molecular structures. To mitigate this, the model integrates a post-processing step that refines the generated 3D structures by enforcing chemical rules and constraints. This hybrid approach combines the strengths of generative models with the precision of chemical knowledge, making E3WAE a promising tool for de novo 3D molecule generation in drug discovery and materials science [22]. The ability to generate optimized molecules with high binding affinity while maintaining chemical validity positions E3WAE as a significant advancement in the field of computational molecular design.

### 4.1.3 TurboHopp for Scaffold Hopping
TurboHopp represents a significant advancement in scaffold hopping, a technique pivotal for generating novel chemical scaffolds with similar biological activities but distinct structures compared to known active compounds. Unlike traditional methods that often rely on manual intervention and heuristic rules, TurboHopp leverages deep learning and graph neural networks to automate the scaffold hopping process. By encoding both the molecular graph and the protein-ligand interaction environment, TurboHopp can efficiently explore the chemical space and identify promising scaffolds that maintain the desired biological activity while differing structurally from the initial lead compound.

The core innovation of TurboHopp lies in its ability to perform rapid and accurate scaffold hopping through an E(3)-equivariant consistency model. This model ensures that the generated molecules not only retain the essential pharmacophoric features necessary for binding to the target protein but also exhibit improved drug-like properties such as solubility, permeability, and metabolic stability. The equivariant nature of the model allows it to handle the 3D geometry of molecules effectively, ensuring that the generated scaffolds fit well into the binding site of the target protein. This is achieved by incorporating geometric constraints during the generation process, which helps in maintaining the spatial relationships between the functional groups of the molecule and the residues of the protein.

Furthermore, TurboHopp addresses the computational efficiency challenge by significantly reducing the generation time compared to traditional diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). The model achieves this through a combination of advanced sampling techniques and a learnable standardization module that mitigates scale imbalances across molecular features, thereby improving numerical stability and convergence speed [23]. This efficiency makes TurboHopp particularly suitable for large-scale drug discovery projects where rapid iteration and exploration of chemical space are crucial. The integration of these features not only enhances the quality of the generated molecules but also streamlines the drug discovery pipeline, making it a valuable tool for pharmaceutical researchers.

## 4.2 Multi-Fidelity and Active Learning

### 4.2.1 Multi-Fidelity Latent Space Active Learning
Multi-Fidelity Latent Space Active Learning (MF-LAL) represents a significant advancement in the generative modeling of chemical compounds, particularly in the context of drug discovery [2]. This framework integrates active learning with multi-fidelity surrogate models, allowing for the simultaneous generation and evaluation of compounds at different levels of fidelity [2]. By leveraging a sequence of hierarchical latent spaces, MF-LAL enables the generative model to adapt to the varying levels of complexity and accuracy required by different oracles, such as docking and binding free energy methods. Each latent space is specialized for a particular fidelity level, which not only enhances the quality of the generated queries but also facilitates more accurate and efficient surrogate modeling [2].

The core mechanism of MF-LAL lies in its ability to perform surrogate modeling and generation in tandem at each fidelity level. This is achieved through a series of latent spaces that are organized to predict and generate compounds at specific levels of detail. The use of hierarchical latent spaces ensures that the model can efficiently handle the trade-off between computational cost and predictive accuracy. For instance, lower-fidelity oracles, which are computationally less expensive, can be used to screen a large number of compounds, while higher-fidelity oracles can be reserved for more detailed evaluations of the most promising candidates. This approach not only optimizes the use of computational resources but also accelerates the discovery process by reducing the number of high-fidelity evaluations required.

In practice, MF-LAL operates by iteratively selecting the most uncertain compounds from the current latent space and querying the appropriate oracle for feedback. The results from these queries are then used to update the training data for the surrogate model, which in turn refines the latent space and improves the generative capabilities of the model. This active learning loop ensures that the model continuously learns and adapts, leading to the generation of increasingly high-quality and diverse compounds. The integration of multi-fidelity oracles, such as docking and binding free energy methods, further enhances the model's ability to predict the biological activity and synthesizability of the generated compounds, making MF-LAL a powerful tool for accelerating the drug discovery pipeline.

### 4.2.2 MetaMolGen for Few-Shot Generation
MetaMolGen is a meta-learning-based molecular generation model specifically designed to address the challenges of few-shot molecular generation [23]. Unlike traditional generative models that require vast amounts of data to achieve optimal performance, MetaMolGen can effectively leverage prior knowledge to rapidly adapt with only a fraction of the data, making it highly suitable for scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This is achieved through a meta-learning framework that captures the underlying patterns and structures in molecular data, allowing the model to generalize well to new tasks with minimal retraining.

Through large-scale experiments on multiple datasets, including ChEMBL, QM9, ZINC, and MOSES, the advantages of MetaMolGen in molecular generation tasks have been extensively validated [23]. The model significantly outperforms traditional generative models in terms of validity, uniqueness, property matching accuracy, and generation quality, as reflected in its superior Overall Score across key metrics. Specifically, MetaMolGen excels in generating molecules with specific chemical properties based on given target attributes, demonstrating its capability for conditional generation [23]. This feature is particularly valuable in drug discovery, where the ability to generate molecules with desired properties is crucial for optimizing lead compounds [24].

Moreover, MetaMolGen's ability to balance model validity and uniqueness is a significant advancement in the field. Traditional generative models often struggle to maintain a high level of validity while ensuring the diversity of generated molecules. MetaMolGen addresses this challenge by incorporating a meta-learning strategy that fine-tunes the model's parameters to better capture the trade-offs between validity and uniqueness. This results in a more robust and versatile model that can generate a wide range of molecules, from small organic compounds to complex macromolecules, with high fidelity and diversity. The model's performance on benchmarks such as the CrossDocked2020 pocket-conditional generation benchmark further underscores its potential to drive innovation in structure-based drug design [19].

### 4.2.3 RXNFLOW for Synthesis-Oriented Generation
RXNFLOW is a synthesis-oriented generative framework that leverages generative flow networks (GFlowNets) to navigate and generate synthetic pathways for drug design [19]. Unlike traditional generative models that focus solely on the structural properties of molecules, RXNFLOW integrates the synthetic feasibility of the generated compounds by training on a large action space of reaction templates and building blocks [19]. This approach ensures that the generated molecules are not only structurally valid but also readily synthesizable, addressing a critical gap in the field of de novo molecular design [6].

A key innovation in RXNFLOW is the introduction of action space subsampling, which allows the model to handle the vast combinatorial space of possible reactions and reactants without incurring significant memory overhead [19]. This is achieved through an importance sampling technique, where the model selectively samples from the action space based on the current state of the synthetic pathway. This subsampling strategy not only reduces computational complexity but also enhances the model's ability to explore diverse synthetic routes, leading to a more comprehensive and realistic generation of synthetic pathways.

The molecular generation process in RXNFLOW is iterative, with the model progressively building synthetic pathways by selecting the most probable actions at each step. The policy estimation, which guides the selection of actions, is refined through continuous training, ensuring that the generated pathways are optimized for both synthetic feasibility and desired molecular properties. This approach not only accelerates the discovery of novel compounds but also provides a clear and actionable synthetic plan, making RXNFLOW a powerful tool for synthetic chemists and drug designers.

## 4.3 Property Prediction and Optimization

### 4.3.1 Two-Phase Generative Approach
The two-phase generative approach represents a significant advancement in the field of molecular generative models, particularly in the context of de novo drug design [2]. This approach divides the molecular generation process into two distinct phases: the 'molecule nucleation phase' and the 'molecule growth phase' [25]. The nucleation phase focuses on the initial formation of a stable molecular core, analogous to the initial crystallization event in physical systems. During this phase, the model generates a small, stable molecular fragment that serves as the seed for subsequent growth. This phase is crucial for ensuring that the initial molecular structure is both chemically plausible and structurally sound, setting a strong foundation for the subsequent growth phase.

In the growth phase, the model expands the initial molecular core by iteratively adding atoms and bonds, guided by the desired molecular properties and structural constraints. This phase is where the model incorporates property predictions and atom type predictions, ensuring that the growing molecule meets specific criteria such as binding affinity, solubility, and synthetic accessibility. By separating the generation process into these two phases, the model can more effectively balance the trade-offs between structural stability and functional optimization. The nucleation phase ensures that the initial structure is robust, while the growth phase allows for fine-tuning and optimization of the molecular properties.

To enhance the performance of the two-phase generative approach, disentangled representation learning is integrated into the model. This involves factorizing the latent space into two disentangled aspects: one representing the desired molecular properties and the other capturing the structural details of the molecule. This disentanglement allows for more precise control over the generation process, enabling the model to generate molecules that not only meet specific property targets but also maintain structural integrity. Additionally, the use of E(3)-equivariant networks ensures that the generated 3D molecular structures are geometrically consistent, further improving the quality and realism of the generated molecules [21]. This approach not only addresses the limitations of previous generative models but also opens new avenues for the design of highly optimized and synthesizable molecules [6].

### 4.3.2 Reinforcement Learning with TANGO
Reinforcement Learning (RL) with TANimoto Group Overlap (TANGO) represents a significant advancement in the field of molecular generative modeling, particularly in the context of drug design [6]. TANGO leverages RL to optimize the generation of molecules that are not only synthetically feasible but also possess desired properties [6]. Unlike traditional RL approaches that often suffer from sparse reward signals, TANGO introduces a dense reward function that guides the model towards generating molecules with specific building blocks and properties. This is achieved by integrating chemical principles into the reward shaping process, ensuring that the generated molecules are not only structurally sound but also align with the constraints of synthetic chemistry.

The TANGO reward function is designed to evaluate the overlap between the generated molecules and predefined building blocks, thereby promoting the creation of molecules that can be synthesized using known chemical reactions. This approach not only enhances the synthesizability of the generated molecules but also allows for the simultaneous optimization of other molecular properties, such as binding affinity and solubility [6]. By incorporating forward reaction models into the evaluation process, TANGO can simulate the synthetic routes of the generated molecules, providing a more realistic assessment of their feasibility. This integration of forward reaction models with RL ensures that the model learns to generate molecules that are not only theoretically possible but also practically viable in a laboratory setting.

Furthermore, the TANGO framework demonstrates the effectiveness of using RL to overcome the limitations of traditional generative models, which often struggle with the complexity and diversity of chemical space. By allowing the model to learn through incentives rather than strict constraints, TANGO fosters a more flexible and adaptive approach to molecular generation. This flexibility is crucial in drug design, where the ability to explore a wide range of molecular structures is essential for identifying novel and effective therapeutic candidates [8]. The results of experiments using TANGO show that it can generalize across different types of synthesis constraints, making it a versatile tool for various drug discovery applications.

### 4.3.3 Three-Stage Synthesizability Evaluation
In the context of molecular design, synthesizability is a critical factor that significantly influences the practical applicability of generated molecules [6]. The three-stage synthesizability evaluation framework is designed to systematically assess and ensure the synthesizability of molecules generated by generative models [6]. The first stage involves a preliminary screening using fast, heuristic-based methods to filter out molecules that are clearly unsynthesizable. These methods often rely on synthetic accessibility scores (SAs) or other computationally inexpensive metrics that can quickly identify molecules with infeasible synthetic routes. While these heuristics are useful for initial filtering, they are inherently limited in their ability to capture the complex nuances of chemical synthesis.

The second stage of the evaluation framework employs more sophisticated, data-driven retrosynthetic planners to propose potential synthetic routes for the molecules that pass the initial screening [3]. These planners, which are typically based on deep learning models, can generate a set of plausible synthetic pathways by recursively decomposing the target molecule into simpler building blocks [19]. The success rate of these planners in proposing viable synthetic routes serves as a more stringent measure of synthesizability. However, it is important to note that the success of these planners does not guarantee the practical feasibility of the proposed routes, as many reactions predicted by these models may not be reproducible in a wet lab setting. Therefore, this stage provides a more refined, but still computational, assessment of synthesizability [3].

The final stage of the three-stage evaluation framework involves experimental validation, where a subset of the molecules that pass the computational evaluations is synthesized in a laboratory setting to confirm their actual synthesizability [3]. This stage is crucial for providing a ground truth against which the predictions of the computational models can be validated. The experimental results not only confirm the synthesizability of the generated molecules but also provide valuable feedback for refining the computational models. By integrating these three stages, the framework ensures a comprehensive and robust evaluation of synthesizability, thereby enhancing the practical utility of generative models in molecular design [6].

# 5 Integrative Approaches for Structure-Based Drug Design

## 5.1 Multi-Task Learning and Docking

### 5.1.1 FABFlex for Blind Flexible Docking
FABFlex is a novel approach designed to address the limitations of traditional rigid docking methods by incorporating flexibility in both the ligand and the protein. Unlike earlier methods that assume a static protein structure, FABFlex models the dynamic nature of protein pockets, which is crucial for accurate ligand binding predictions. This method employs a deep learning framework that integrates molecular dynamics simulations to simulate the conformational changes of the protein and ligand during the docking process. By doing so, FABFlex can more accurately predict the binding poses of ligands, even in cases where the protein pocket is highly flexible or undergoes significant structural changes upon ligand binding.

The performance of FABFlex has been rigorously evaluated on the PDBBind benchmark, a widely used dataset for assessing docking methods [20]. In these experiments, FABFlex demonstrated a significant improvement in the accuracy of ligand binding predictions, with a 40.59% increase in the percentage of ligand root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) below 2 Å, compared to traditional rigid docking methods [20]. Additionally, FABFlex achieved a reduced pocket RMSD of 1.10 Å, indicating its ability to accurately model the conformational changes of the protein pocket. These results highlight the method's capability to handle the complexities of flexible docking, which is essential for designing high-affinity ligands for drug discovery [20].

Moreover, FABFlex addresses the computational efficiency challenge that often hinders the practical application of flexible docking methods. By leveraging advanced computational techniques and parallel processing, FABFlex achieves a remarkable speedup of approximately 208 times compared to recent flexible docking methods. This significant improvement in computational efficiency makes FABFlex a practical and powerful tool for large-scale drug discovery projects, where the ability to rapidly screen a vast number of ligand candidates is crucial. The combination of high accuracy and computational efficiency positions FABFlex as a leading method for blind flexible docking, offering a promising avenue for advancing structure-based drug design.

### 5.1.2 IDOLpro for Latent Variable Optimization
IDOLpro (Inverse Design of Optimal Ligands for Protein pockets) represents a significant advancement in the field of structure-based drug design (SBDD) by leveraging latent variable optimization within a diffusion model framework [26]. Unlike traditional methods that rely on empirical energy scoring functions, IDOLpro employs a generative workflow that actively guides the diffusion process to produce optimized ligands for a given protein pocket [26]. The core innovation lies in the modification of latent variables at a strategic point in the reverse diffusion process, allowing for the fine-tuning of generated ligands to meet specific physicochemical objectives.

The workflow of IDOLpro begins with the sampling of a random latent vector \( z_{\ell T} \) for each ligand in the batch, conditioned on the pocket coordinates \( z_p \) [26]. This initial step sets the stage for the reverse diffusion process, which is run from time \( T \) to a predefined optimization horizon \( t_h \). During this phase, the latent variables are modified to optimize one or more target properties, such as binding affinity, solubility, or drug-likeness. The optimization is guided by a set of differentiable scores that define the desired physicochemical properties, enabling the model to iteratively refine the ligand structures. This approach not only ensures that the generated ligands are structurally plausible but also aligns them with the specific requirements of the drug discovery process [27].

By integrating classifier guidance techniques, IDOLpro enhances the interpretability and controllability of the generative process. Classifier guidance allows the diffusion model to generate samples conditioned on the gradients of classifiers, which provide feedback on the quality and relevance of the generated ligands. This feedback loop is crucial for refining the ligand structures and ensuring that they meet the desired criteria. The ability to inspect the model's structure prediction trajectories also provides valuable insights into the common molecular interactions that drive the optimization process [24]. Overall, IDOLpro offers a powerful and flexible framework for the rational design of ligands, bridging the gap between structural precision and chemical reasoning in the pursuit of novel therapeutic candidates.

### 5.1.3 FlowDock for Protein-Ligand Prediction
FlowDock is a state-of-the-art hybrid generative model designed for flow matching-based protein-ligand structure prediction and binding affinity estimation [28]. Unlike traditional models that focus solely on structural prediction, FlowDock integrates both structure and affinity prediction, providing a comprehensive framework for drug discovery [28]. The model leverages a flow-based architecture to transform the apo state of protein pockets and noisy ligands into holo states and their corresponding binding ligand molecules [8]. This approach ensures that the generated structures are not only physically plausible but also have a high likelihood of binding to the target protein.

The core of FlowDock's architecture is an SE(3)-equivariant full-atom flow model, which ensures that the transformations are invariant to rotations and translations, a critical property for maintaining the physical integrity of molecular structures. The model is trained using a dataset of apo and holo state pairs, which serve as a natural coupling for conditional flow matching. This training regime allows the model to learn the intricate relationships between the apo and holo states, enabling it to generate highly accurate and realistic holo structures. The flow model's ability to transport one arbitrary distribution to another is particularly useful in this context, as it can effectively capture the dynamic nature of protein-ligand interactions [8].

To enhance the practical utility of FlowDock, the model incorporates a stochastic version that can generate multiple plausible holo states for a given apo state, reflecting the inherent variability in protein-ligand binding [8]. This feature is crucial for screening drug candidates, as it allows researchers to explore a broader range of potential binding modes and select the most promising candidates for further evaluation. Additionally, FlowDock's modular design facilitates the integration of various physicochemical scores, such as binding affinity and synthetic accessibility, directly into the optimization process. This direct integration avoids the need for intermediate regressors, streamlining the drug discovery pipeline and improving the efficiency of ligand optimization.

## 5.2 Language Models and Hybrid Approaches

### 5.2.1 DrugGen for Policy Optimization
In the realm of deep learning-driven drug discovery, the development of DrugGen represents a significant advancement in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for the generation of optimized drug candidates [29]. DrugGen, built upon the DrugGPT architecture, is finetuned using a meticulously curated dataset of approved drug-target pairs, enhancing its ability to generate molecules with desired properties [29]. The integration of policy optimization techniques further refines the model's capabilities, allowing it to iteratively improve the quality of generated drug candidates by optimizing specific molecular properties such as binding affinity, solubility, and toxicity.

The policy optimization framework employed in DrugGen is designed to dynamically adjust the generative process based on feedback from property predictors. This approach involves training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to navigate the chemical space, proposing molecular modifications that enhance the desired properties while maintaining chemical feasibility [6]. The RL agent receives rewards based on the improvement in the target properties of the generated molecules, encouraging it to explore and exploit the chemical space efficiently. This iterative process ensures that the generated molecules not only meet the initial design criteria but also exhibit enhanced properties that align with the therapeutic goals [6].

To evaluate the effectiveness of DrugGen, a series of experiments were conducted using a diverse set of molecular optimization tasks. The results demonstrated that DrugGen outperformed baseline models in terms of generating molecules with high validity, diversity, and novelty [29]. The model's ability to produce molecules with optimized properties was particularly noteworthy, highlighting its potential for accelerating the early stages of drug discovery [30]. The use of custom metrics, such as binding affinity and synthetic accessibility, provided a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance, underscoring the importance of fine-tuning and policy optimization in enhancing the practical utility of generative models in drug design [3].

### 5.2.2 Fragment Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Fragment Retrieval-Augmented Generation (f-RAG) represents a significant advancement in the field of molecular design by integrating retrieval-augmented generation with pre-trained molecular language models [31]. This approach leverages the strengths of both hard and soft fragment retrieval to enhance the exploration-exploitation trade-off in the generation of novel molecular structures. Hard fragments, which are well-defined and structurally rigid, provide a solid foundation for the generation process, ensuring that the generated molecules adhere to known pharmacophoric constraints. Soft fragments, on the other hand, offer a more flexible and exploratory component, allowing the model to generate diverse and potentially novel molecular scaffolds. By combining these two types of fragments, f-RAG can effectively balance the need for innovation with the requirement for structural validity.

The f-RAG framework augments the pre-trained molecular language model, SAFE-GPT, with a fragment injection module that integrates the retrieved fragments into the generation process [31]. This module injects the embeddings of hard fragments (or input embeddings) into the middle layers of SAFE-GPT, enabling the model to generate new fragments while referencing the information conveyed by the soft fragments [31]. This mechanism ensures that the generated molecules are not only structurally sound but also possess the desired functional properties. The fragment injection module is designed to be lightweight, minimizing computational overhead while maximizing the impact on the generative process. This approach allows f-RAG to explore a broader chemical space, leading to the discovery of more diverse and potentially effective molecules.

To further enhance the exploration capabilities of f-RAG, a post-hoc genetic fragment modification process is employed. This process involves modifying the generated fragments to introduce additional variability and novelty. The genetic modification step can include operations such as fragment swapping, mutation, and recombination, which help to generate a wider range of molecular structures. The combination of hard and soft fragment retrieval, along with the genetic modification process, enables f-RAG to produce molecules that are both innovative and biologically relevant. The effectiveness of f-RAG has been validated through various molecular design tasks, demonstrating its potential to accelerate the drug discovery process by generating high-quality lead compounds.

### 5.2.3 Collaborative Intelligence Drug Design
Collaborative Intelligence Drug Design (CIDD) represents a significant advancement in the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with traditional drug discovery methodologies [7]. This framework leverages the complementary strengths of 3D structure-based drug design (3D-SBDD) models and large language models (LLMs) to address the multifaceted challenges of drug discovery [7]. 3D-SBDD models excel in predicting the precise binding interactions between ligands and protein targets, providing a detailed structural foundation for drug design [26]. However, these models often lack the chemical reasoning capabilities necessary to navigate the vast chemical space and ensure the synthesizability and drug-likeness of proposed compounds [30]. LLMs, on the other hand, can generate a diverse range of molecular structures and predict their properties, but they may not always account for the specific protein context and binding interactions.

CIDD bridges this gap by combining the structural precision of 3D-SBDD with the generative and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The process begins with the 3D-SBDD model identifying potential binding sites and predicting the interactions between the ligand and the target protein [7]. These predictions are then fed into the LLM, which uses its extensive chemical knowledge to generate a set of candidate molecules that are likely to bind effectively to the target. The LLM considers factors such as molecular stability, solubility, and synthesizability, ensuring that the generated molecules are not only structurally compatible but also viable for further development. This collaborative approach allows for the generation of more refined and context-aware drug candidates, reducing the likelihood of failure in later stages of drug development.

To further enhance the CIDD framework, a human-in-the-loop process is integrated, enabling chemists to review and refine the AI-generated candidates [32]. This collaborative aspect is crucial, as it leverages the expertise of human chemists to provide critical feedback and suggest additional modifications or constraints. The chemist’s input helps guide the AI in exploring the chemical space more effectively, ensuring that the generated molecules meet the desired criteria for drug development [32]. The iterative process continues until the convergence criteria are met, producing a set of high-quality drug candidates that are both structurally and chemically optimized. This hybrid approach not only accelerates the drug discovery process but also increases the likelihood of identifying novel and effective therapeutic agents.

## 5.3 Protein Dynamics and Cross-Modal Models

### 5.3.1 DYNAMICFLOW for Full-Atom Modeling
DYNAMICFLOW represents a significant advancement in the integration of protein dynamics into structure-based drug design, addressing the limitations of static models by incorporating the dynamic nature of protein-ligand interactions [8]. This model is built upon a large dataset of molecular dynamics traces, including both apo and holo states of protein-ligand complexes, which provides a comprehensive view of the conformational changes that occur upon ligand binding. The SE(3)-equivariant full-atom flow model in DYNAMICFLOW is designed to transform the apo states of protein pockets into holo states, generating the corresponding 3D ligand molecules in the process [8]. This transformation is achieved through a combination of continuous and discrete flow matching, which models the distribution of atom positions, atom types, and bond types of the ligand, ensuring that the generated molecules are not only structurally plausible but also dynamically consistent with the protein environment.

To enhance the robustness and accuracy of the model, DYNAMICFLOW introduces a stochastic version of the flow, which further promotes the exploration of the conformational space and reduces the risk of overfitting to the training data. The stochastic flow is trained to learn the dynamics of both backbone frames and side-chain torsions of protein pockets, capturing the subtle movements that are critical for ligand binding and function [8]. This approach not only improves the model's ability to generate realistic ligand poses but also enhances its predictive power for binding affinity and other functional properties [28]. The integration of protein dynamics into the model training process ensures that the generated ligands are more likely to be effective in real-world biological systems, where proteins are constantly moving and changing shape.

Furthermore, DYNAMICFLOW's ability to generate full-atom models of ligands in the context of their protein binding sites makes it a powerful tool for virtual screening and lead optimization in drug discovery [28]. By accurately modeling the dynamic interactions between proteins and ligands, DYNAMICFLOW can help identify novel compounds that are not only structurally complementary to the target protein but also dynamically stable and functional [28]. This capability is particularly valuable in the early stages of drug development, where the identification of high-quality lead compounds is crucial for the success of the entire discovery process. The model's efficiency and scalability also make it suitable for large-scale screening of chemical libraries, enabling the rapid identification of promising drug candidates for further experimental validation.

### 5.3.2 Chem42 for Target-Specific Ligands
Chem42 represents a significant advancement in the field of target-specific ligand design by integrating a protein language model (Prot42) with a chemical language model, thereby enabling the generation of ligands that are not only structurally valid but also biologically relevant to the target protein [27]. This integration is achieved through a cross-attention mechanism that embeds the protein sequence information into the chemical model, guiding the generation of ligands that are specifically tailored to the target's binding site [27]. The model's ability to generate ligands without the need for explicit 3D structures during training enhances its versatility and applicability across a wide range of protein targets, including those with poorly characterized or flexible binding sites.

The architecture of Chem42 is designed to capture the intricate details of protein-ligand interactions by incorporating both SE(3)-equivariant geometric message passing layers and residue-level Transformer layers [8]. This dual-layer approach ensures that the generated ligands not only fit well into the target's binding pocket but also maintain the necessary chemical properties for high binding affinity and stability. The experimental validation of Chem42 has demonstrated its effectiveness in generating ligands that can stabilize specific protein conformations, such as the Y220C p53 mutant, a critical tumor suppressor protein [27]. The model's output was compared to a known stabilizer, JC769, and showed comparable binding poses, highlighting its potential for structure-guided drug design.

Furthermore, Chem42's generative capabilities are complemented by its ability to integrate with downstream evaluation pipelines, allowing for the rapid assessment of generated ligands' binding affinities and synthetic accessibility. This streamlined process reduces the computational overhead typically associated with traditional drug discovery workflows, making it a valuable tool for accelerating the identification of lead compounds [24]. The model's flexibility in handling diverse protein targets and its capacity to generate multiple high-quality ligand candidates make it a promising approach for addressing the complex challenges of modern drug discovery.

### 5.3.3 DL-Guided Drug Discovery Pipeline
The DL-guided drug discovery pipeline is designed to streamline the integration of deep learning (DL) techniques into the drug discovery process, addressing the complexities and challenges associated with traditional methods [30]. This pipeline encompasses a range of tasks, from target identification to compound realization, leveraging advanced DL models to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of each step. Specifically, the pipeline utilizes structure-based clustering of predicted proteomes from multiple pathogens to identify conserved, essential bacterial targets that lack homologous sequences in human hosts, thereby reducing the risk of off-target effects [30]. This approach not only accelerates the target identification phase but also ensures that the selected targets are biologically relevant and druggable.

Central to the pipeline is the use of DL models for de novo 3D ligand design, a critical step in structure-based drug design (SBDD) [26]. These models, such as DeepBlock and TamGen, are trained on large datasets of protein-ligand complexes to predict and generate novel ligands with high binding affinity to specific target pockets [28]. The models employ sophisticated techniques, including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), to explore the vast chemical space and produce diverse, drug-like molecules [14]. By integrating these DL models with traditional SBDD methods, the pipeline enhances the ability to design ligands that not only fit well into the target binding site but also meet key medicinal chemistry criteria, such as solubility and synthetic feasibility.

To further refine the generated ligands, the pipeline incorporates a collaborative intelligence approach, combining the strengths of protein language models (pLMs) and chemical language models (cLMs) [27]. This collaboration allows for the generation of ligands that are not only structurally optimized but also contextually appropriate within the biological system [27]. For instance, the pLM, Prot42, can embed the molecular features of a target protein, guiding the cLM, Chem42, to generate ligands that are tailored to the specific interactions within the protein's binding pocket [27]. This integrated approach not only improves the binding affinity of the designed ligands but also enhances their overall drug-likeness, making them more suitable for downstream development and clinical testing [26]. The DL-guided pipeline thus represents a comprehensive and innovative solution for accelerating the drug discovery process, from target identification to lead optimization.

# 6 Future Directions


The current landscape of generative AI in drug discovery, while promising, is not without its limitations and gaps. One of the primary challenges is the computational efficiency and scalability of the models, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional and complex data such as 3D molecular structures and protein dynamics. Current models often require significant computational resources, which can be a bottleneck in large-scale applications. Additionally, the models' ability to generalize across different protein families and chemical spaces remains limited, often leading to suboptimal performance when applied to novel or diverse datasets. Another critical gap is the integration of physical and biological constraints into the generative process, which is essential for ensuring the synthesizability and biological relevance of the generated molecules. Despite the advancements in generative models, there is still a need for more robust methods to predict and optimize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the generated compounds, which are crucial for their success in clinical trials.

To address these limitations, several directions for future research are proposed. First, the development of more efficient and scalable generative models is essential.

Additionally, the integration of hardware acceleration, such as GPUs and TPUs, can significantly speed up the training and inference processes, making these models more accessible for large-scale applications.

Second, enhancing the models' ability to generalize and adapt to diverse datasets is crucial. This could be achieved through the development of meta-learning and transfer learning approaches that allow models to quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal retraining. Another promising direction is the use of multi-task learning frameworks that can simultaneously optimize for multiple objectives, such as binding affinity, solubility, and synthetic feasibility. This would enable the generation of molecules that are not only structurally valid but also optimized for a wide range of properties.

Third, the integration of physical and biological constraints into the generative process is essential for ensuring the practical applicability of the generated molecules. This could involve the development of constraint-aware generative models that explicitly incorporate rules and constraints from chemistry and biology, such as the rules of organic synthesis and the principles of protein-ligand interactions. Additionally, the use of hybrid models that combine generative AI with traditional computational chemistry methods, such as molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemistry, can provide a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the generated molecules.

The potential impact of these proposed future research directions is significant. More efficient and scalable generative models would accelerate the drug discovery process, enabling researchers to explore a broader chemical space and identify novel drug candidates more rapidly. Enhanced generalization and adaptability would make these models more versatile, allowing them to be applied to a wider range of therapeutic areas and diseases. The integration of physical and biological constraints would ensure that the generated molecules are not only structurally sound but also viable and effective in real-world biological systems, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful clinical outcomes. Overall, these advancements would contribute to the development of more effective and safer drugs, ultimately improving patient outcomes and advancing the field of pharmaceutical research.
