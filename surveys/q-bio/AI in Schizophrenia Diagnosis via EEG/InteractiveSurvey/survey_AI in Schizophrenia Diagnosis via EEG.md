# 2 Introduction
Schizophrenia is a complex and debilitating mental disorder characterized by a range of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral symptoms [1]. It affects approximately 1% of the global population and poses significant challenges for both patients and healthcare providers. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as clinical interviews and psychological assessments, are often subjective and can be influenced by the clinician's experience and the patient's ability to articulate their symptoms. Moreover, the early detection of schizophrenia remains a critical challenge, as early intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroimaging technologies have opened new avenues for more objective and reliable diagnostic tools. Among these, electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a promising modality due to its non-invasive nature, high temporal resolution, and cost-effectiveness. This survey paper focuses on the application of AI techniques to EEG data for the diagnosis of schizophrenia, highlighting the latest research trends, methodologies, and challenges in this field.

The primary research topic of this survey paper is the integration of AI techniques with EEG data to enhance the accuracy and reliability of schizophrenia diagnosis. Specifically, the paper explores the use of advanced machine learning and deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformer models, to extract meaningful features from EEG signals. The paper also examines the role of multimodal integration, combining EEG with other data sources such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and clinical data, to improve diagnostic performance. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges associated with EEG data, including signal variability, noise, and the need for large, well-annotated datasets, and proposes potential solutions to these challenges.

The paper begins by discussing the importance of feature extraction and enhancement in EEG-based schizophrenia diagnosis. It highlights the use of dynamic window mechanisms (DWM) and channel and spatial attention mechanisms (CBAM) to improve feature localization and extraction. The integration of self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques, such as the DINOv2 architecture, is also discussed, emphasizing their role in extracting high-quality features from large, unlabeled datasets [2]. The paper then delves into the concept of dynamic receptive field selection (DRFS), explaining how it allows models to adaptively select the most appropriate receptive fields based on the input data, thereby enhancing the precision of feature localization [3]. Furthermore, the paper explores methods for reducing information redundancy, such as the V-ViT framework, which leverages a voting system and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout to produce more reliable and concise feature representations.

Next, the paper examines the role of self-supervised learning and pretraining in enhancing the robustness of AI models for EEG-based schizophrenia diagnosis. It discusses the use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and two-stage pretraining strategies, which combine an initial pretraining phase on large, unlabeled datasets with a fine-tuning phase on smaller, labeled datasets specific to the target task. The paper highlights the benefits of these approaches, including improved feature extraction capabilities and enhanced generalization to new and unseen data. Additionally, the paper explores the integration of cross-attention mechanisms and multi-scale feature fusion to further improve the robustness of ViT models in handling complex EEG data.

The paper also covers the use of generative models for data augmentation and enhancing dataset diversity. It discusses the challenges of racial biases in machine learning models and the importance of balanced and diverse datasets in ensuring equitable healthcare outcomes. The paper examines techniques such as adaptive batch normalization (FairAdaBN) and ensemble methods to mitigate racial biases and improve fairness [4]. Furthermore, it explores the use of high-resolution image generation techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), to enhance the quality and detail of EEG data [5]. The paper also discusses the integration of domain-specific knowledge and data augmentation techniques to address the unique challenges of medical imaging data.

Finally, the paper concludes by summarizing the key contributions of this survey. It provides a comprehensive overview of the latest research trends and methodologies in AI for EEG-based schizophrenia diagnosis, highlighting the potential of advanced feature extraction, self-supervised learning, and generative models. The paper also identifies the challenges and future directions in this field, emphasizing the need for large, well-annotated datasets, improved interpretability, and the integration of multimodal data to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reliability. By synthesizing the current state of the art and identifying gaps in the literature, this survey aims to guide future research and development in AI for schizophrenia diagnosis.

# 3 Multimodal Integration and Enhancement

## 3.1 Cross-Attention and Dynamic Window Mechanism

### 3.1.1 Enhancing Feature Localization and Extraction
Enhancing feature localization and extraction is crucial for improving the accuracy and reliability of medical image analysis systems. One of the primary challenges in this domain is the variability and complexity of medical images, which often contain subtle and intricate patterns that are difficult to discern. To address this, recent approaches have focused on integrating advanced feature extraction techniques with sophisticated localization mechanisms. For instance, the use of dynamic window mechanisms (DWM) in patch selection modules has shown promise in autonomously identifying optimal receptive fields, thereby minimizing the likelihood of focusing on irrelevant information [3]. This approach not only enhances the precision of feature localization but also improves the overall efficiency of the model by reducing computational overhead.

Another significant advancement in this area is the integration of Channel and Spatial Attention Mechanisms (CBAM) into the feature extraction pipeline. CBAM enhances the model's ability to selectively focus on relevant features by adaptively recalibrating channel-wise and spatial-wise feature responses. By doing so, CBAM helps in mitigating the impact of noise and irrelevant features, which are common in medical images due to variations in imaging conditions and patient-specific factors. This dual attention mechanism ensures that the model can effectively capture both global and local features, leading to more robust and accurate predictions. The combination of DWM and CBAM has been particularly effective in tasks such as lesion detection and segmentation, where precise localization is critical for clinical decision-making.

Furthermore, the integration of self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques, such as those employed in the DINOv2 architecture, has revolutionized the way features are extracted from medical images [2]. By leveraging large-scale unlabeled datasets, SSL methods enable the model to learn rich, generalizable feature representations without the need for extensive manual annotations. This is particularly beneficial in the medical domain, where annotated data is often scarce and expensive to obtain. The DINOv2 architecture, which uses a teacher-student framework based on Vision Transformers (ViT), has demonstrated superior performance in extracting high-quality features from medical images [6]. The alignment mechanism in DINOv2 ensures that the student network learns meaningful feature representations by aligning its outputs with those of the teacher network, thus enhancing the model's ability to capture subtle and complex patterns in the data [6].

### 3.1.2 Dynamic Receptive Field Selection
Dynamic Receptive Field Selection (DRFS) is a critical component in modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers, particularly in medical imaging tasks where the scale and complexity of relevant features can vary significantly. Unlike static receptive fields, which are fixed during the training and inference phases, DRFS allows the model to adaptively select the most appropriate receptive field sizes based on the input data. This adaptability is crucial in scenarios where the diagnostic relevance of features is not uniformly distributed across the image, such as in the detection of glaucoma from fundus images or the segmentation of tumors in MRI scans.

The core mechanism of DRFS involves a dynamic window mechanism (DWM) that operates within a patch selection module. This module autonomously identifies the optimal receptive fields by computing the maximum and total scores of each feature map [3]. These scores are indicative of the relevance and importance of the features within the corresponding regions. By selecting the centers of the highest-scoring patches and determining the boundaries of the receptive fields based on the scales of these regions, the DWM ensures that the model focuses on the most informative areas of the image [3]. This process not only enhances feature localization but also reduces the risk of overfitting to noise or irrelevant information, which is a common issue in medical imaging datasets characterized by high inter-observer variability.

In practice, the implementation of DRFS involves integrating the DWM into a multi-branch architecture, where the global branch captures spatial features at a global level, and the local branch extracts features from the region of interest (ROI). The DWM-based local branch, which is the key innovation, dynamically adjusts the receptive fields to ensure that the model can effectively handle both fine-grained and global features [3]. This adaptive approach has been shown to improve the overall performance of the model, particularly in tasks requiring precise localization and classification, such as the early detection of diabetic retinopathy or the segmentation of breast cancer lesions. By dynamically adjusting the receptive fields, the model can better capture the heterogeneity of medical images, leading to more accurate and reliable diagnostic outcomes.

### 3.1.3 Reducing Information Redundancy
Reducing information redundancy is a critical aspect of optimizing the performance and efficiency of machine learning models, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices or edge computing. In the context of medical imaging, where large volumes of data are generated and processed, redundancy can lead to increased storage requirements, longer processing times, and higher computational costs. One effective approach to addressing this issue is through the implementation of a voting system, as seen in the V-ViT (Voting-based ViT) framework [7]. This system leverages multiple assessments from different models or experts, averaging their outputs to produce a more reliable and less redundant final result. By aggregating diverse perspectives, the voting system can filter out noise and inconsistencies, leading to a more concise and accurate representation of the data.

In the V-ViT framework, the voting system is further enhanced by incorporating Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, a technique that introduces stochasticity during the inference phase to estimate the uncertainty of predictions. This probabilistic approach helps in identifying and reducing redundant information by focusing on the most confident and consistent predictions. The MC dropout-based voting system not only improves the robustness of the model but also ensures that the final output is well-calibrated, aligning the predicted probabilities with the actual likelihood of correctness. This is particularly important in clinical settings, where overconfidence in predictions can lead to incorrect diagnoses and inappropriate treatments, while underconfidence can result in missed opportunities for early intervention.

To further optimize the reduction of information redundancy, the V-ViT framework employs a selection optimization strategy that prioritizes the most informative and relevant data points during training. This is achieved through a combination of cross-entropy loss functions and adaptive weighting schemes, which emphasize cases with higher losses, especially those from underrepresented groups. By focusing on these critical instances, the model can better generalize and reduce redundancy without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, the framework incorporates feature-level alignment and consistency losses to ensure that the student model, trained on a larger but noisier dataset, learns to mimic the refined and concise representations of the teacher model. This hierarchical learning approach not only reduces redundancy but also enhances the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the model in handling complex medical imaging tasks.

## 3.2 Self-Supervised Learning and Pretraining

### 3.2.1 Vision Transformers for Robust Feature Learning
Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a powerful alternative to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for robust feature learning in medical imaging, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained and global feature extraction [8]. Unlike CNNs, which rely on local receptive fields and convolutional operations, ViTs leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and global context. This is particularly beneficial in medical imaging, where both local details (e.g., lesion boundaries) and global structures (e.g., overall tissue patterns) are crucial for accurate diagnosis. For instance, in breast cancer diagnosis, ViTs can effectively model the intricate relationships between lesion shapes and the surrounding tissue, leading to more accurate and robust feature representations.

To enhance the robustness of feature learning, several advanced techniques have been integrated into ViT architectures. One such technique is the use of self-supervised learning frameworks, such as DINOv2, which employ a teacher-student framework to pre-train ViTs on large, unlabeled datasets. This pre-training step enables the model to learn high-quality visual features that can be fine-tuned for specific medical imaging tasks with minimal labeled data. Additionally, methods like Efficient Self-supervised Vision Transformers (EsViT) introduce token sparsification to focus on the most informative regions within an image, thereby reducing computational costs while preserving the ability to extract high-quality features [2]. This is particularly useful in handling high-resolution medical images, such as whole slide images (WSIs) in pathology, where computational efficiency is critical.

Moreover, the integration of cross-attention mechanisms and multi-scale feature fusion has further improved the robustness of ViTs in medical imaging. Cross-attention allows the model to incorporate information from multiple sources, such as binocular data or metadata, into the feature learning process. For example, in glaucoma diagnosis, a Cross-Attention (CA) block can be integrated into the ViT model to leverage binocular data, enhancing the model's ability to detect subtle changes in the optic nerve head. Additionally, multi-scale feature fusion techniques ensure that the model captures both fine-grained and global features, leading to more comprehensive and accurate representations. These advancements in ViT architectures have significantly contributed to the robustness and generalization capabilities of deep learning models in medical imaging, making them a promising tool for clinical applications.

### 3.2.2 Two-Stage Pretraining Strategies
Two-stage pretraining strategies have emerged as a powerful approach to enhance the performance of deep learning models, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. These strategies typically involve an initial pretraining phase on a large, unlabeled dataset, followed by a fine-tuning phase on a smaller, labeled dataset specific to the target task. The first stage leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to learn rich, generalizable feature representations that capture the underlying structure and patterns of the data [2]. This stage is crucial as it enables the model to develop a robust understanding of the input space, which is particularly beneficial for medical imaging tasks where the data distribution can be highly complex and varied.

In the second stage, the pretrained model is fine-tuned on a smaller, labeled dataset to adapt the learned features to the specific characteristics of the target task. This fine-tuning process is often more efficient and effective than training from scratch, as the model has already acquired a strong foundation of generalizable knowledge. For instance, in the context of breast cancer detection, the Swin-T backbone can be pretrained using the EsViT SSL approach on a large, diverse image dataset, and then fine-tuned on a smaller, domain-specific mammogram dataset [2]. This twostage pretraining strategy not only improves the model's feature extraction capabilities but also enhances its ability to capture complex patterns in mammograms, even when the labeled training data is limited. The integration of SSL pretraining has been shown to significantly boost performance metrics such as AUC, accuracy, and F1-score, demonstrating its potential for advancing the accuracy of medical image analysis [2].

Moreover, the flexibility of two-stage pretraining strategies allows for the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge and constraints during the fine-tuning phase, further refining the model's performance. For example, in skin disease classification, the pretrained model can be fine-tuned with a focus on underrepresented subgroups, such as images of darker skin tones, to address issues of fairness and bias [5]. This approach ensures that the model generalizes well across different patient populations and reduces the risk of overfitting to the dominant subgroup in the training data. Overall, two-stage pretraining strategies represent a promising direction for improving the robustness, efficiency, and fairness of deep learning models in medical imaging applications.

### 3.2.3 Enhancing Classification Performance
Enhancing classification performance in medical imaging, particularly in glaucoma diagnosis, is a critical challenge due to the high inter-observer variability and subjective nature of the task [7]. To mitigate these issues, a multi-specialist approach is proposed, where dataset labels are generated based on the averaged assessments of multiple trusted ophthalmologists [7]. This method not only reduces the influence of any single ophthalmologist's bias but also indirectly achieves the benefits of label smoothing, leading to improved calibration and overall model performance. By leveraging the collective expertise of multiple specialists, the model can better generalize and handle the inherent variability in glaucoma diagnosis [7].

To further enhance the robustness and fairness of the classification model, a novel selection optimization framework is introduced. This framework emphasizes cases with higher cross-entropy loss in underrepresented groups, ensuring that the model is trained to perform well across diverse patient populations. For instance, diagnostic accuracy is often lower for images of darker skin tones compared to lighter skin tones, a common issue in medical image classification [4]. By giving more emphasis to these underrepresented cases during training, the model can achieve more balanced performance across different subgroups, thereby reducing bias and improving overall fairness. This approach is particularly important in medical applications, where fairness and accuracy are paramount for ensuring equitable patient outcomes.

Additionally, the integration of advanced techniques such as self-supervised learning (SSL) and Vision Transformers (ViT) can significantly boost classification performance. The use of SSL allows the model to learn rich, generalizable feature representations from large, unlabeled datasets, which can then be fine-tuned on smaller, labeled datasets for specific tasks. This not only reduces the annotation burden but also enhances the model's ability to generalize to new and unseen data. Furthermore, the implementation of a hierarchical prediction mechanism and a voting system based on Monte Carlo (MC) dropout can further improve the model's reliability and interpretability, making it a more robust tool for clinical decision-making.

## 3.3 Generative Models for Data Augmentation

### 3.3.1 Mitigating Racial Biases
Mitigating racial biases in machine learning models, particularly in medical applications, is crucial for ensuring equitable healthcare outcomes [9]. Racial biases can manifest in various ways, such as systematic underdiagnosis of diseases in certain racial groups, which can lead to delayed treatment and poorer health outcomes. For instance, deep learning models trained on chest X-rays have been shown to underdiagnose conditions in Black patients, likely due to underrepresentation in training datasets [10]. Addressing these biases requires a multifaceted approach, including the use of balanced and diverse datasets, the implementation of fairness-aware algorithms, and the development of metrics to assess and monitor fairness.

One effective strategy to mitigate racial biases is the use of adaptive batch normalization (FairAdaBN), which adjusts the normalization parameters based on sensitive attributes such as race [4]. This technique helps minimize the differences in prediction probabilities between subgroups, thereby reducing unfairness. Another approach involves pruning sensitive nodes from the model architecture to make the model independent of racial attributes. Ensemble methods, such as training separate models for different racial groups and combining them, have also shown promise in improving fairness. For example, Almuzainit et al. proposed an ensemble approach where two models were trained for lighter and darker skin tones, and their predictions were combined to achieve more balanced outcomes [5].

Despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly in the context of underrepresented racial subgroups in medical datasets. Techniques such as synthetic minority over-sampling (SMOTE) and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) can help address data imbalance by generating synthetic samples and enhancing image quality, respectively [11]. Additionally, developing and validating fairness metrics that can comprehensively evaluate the performance of models across different racial groups is essential. These metrics should not only measure overall accuracy but also assess the distribution of errors and the impact on specific subgroups. Ensuring transparency and interpretability in model decisions is also crucial for building trust and facilitating clinical acceptance.

### 3.3.2 High-Resolution Image Generation
High-resolution image generation has emerged as a critical area in medical imaging, driven by the need for detailed and accurate representations of anatomical structures. Techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have been at the forefront of this advancement. GANs, with their adversarial training paradigm, have demonstrated the ability to generate high-fidelity images that closely mimic real data. However, GANs often struggle with mode collapse and require careful tuning of hyperparameters to achieve stable training. In contrast, LDMs, which operate by iteratively denoising images in a latent space, have shown superior performance in generating high-resolution, diverse, and realistic images. The denoising process in LDMs allows for better control over the generation process, making them particularly suitable for medical applications where image quality and detail are paramount.

The success of LDMs in high-resolution image generation can be attributed to their ability to handle complex image structures and textures. These models are trained to progressively refine images by removing noise, which results in high-fidelity outputs. This iterative refinement process is particularly beneficial for medical imaging, where subtle details can be crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. For instance, in the context of fundus imaging, LDMs can generate images that capture the intricate details of the retina, including blood vessels and lesions, which are essential for diagnosing conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. Additionally, LDMs can be conditioned on various attributes, such as patient metadata and clinical biomarkers, to generate images that are not only high-resolution but also clinically relevant.

Despite the advancements in high-resolution image generation, several challenges remain. One of the primary challenges is the computational cost associated with training and deploying these models, especially for large-scale medical datasets. Furthermore, the domain-specific nature of medical imaging requires models to be adapted to handle the unique characteristics of medical data, such as varying image qualities and modalities [12]. To address these challenges, recent research has focused on integrating domain-specific knowledge and data augmentation techniques into the training process. For example, methods like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) have been used to enhance image quality and balance datasets [11]. These techniques, combined with the robust generative capabilities of LDMs, hold the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of medical image analysis.

### 3.3.3 Enhancing Dataset Diversity
Enhancing dataset diversity is crucial for improving the robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, particularly in medical imaging tasks such as glaucoma diagnosis. One of the primary challenges in this domain is the high inter-observer variability among ophthalmologists, which introduces significant subjectivity into dataset labels [7]. Relying on a single ophthalmologist's diagnosis can lead to biased and unreliable labels, thereby affecting the model's performance. To mitigate this, integrating multiple trusted specialists' opinions can provide a more balanced and reliable dataset. This approach not only reduces the influence of any single ophthalmologist's biases but also indirectly achieves the benefits of label smoothing, leading to better-calibrated models.

To further enhance dataset diversity, several novel approaches have been proposed. First, incorporating binocular data through a Cross-Attention (CA) block in the Vision Transformer (ViT) model can help capture more comprehensive and contextually rich features. This integration ensures that the model considers both eyes simultaneously, which is particularly important in conditions like glaucoma where binocular information can provide additional diagnostic insights. Second, concatenating demographic information such as age and sex into the patch embeddings can help the model account for population-specific variations, thereby improving its generalization capabilities. Finally, consulting a panel of 1 to 18 trusted ophthalmologists to create a custom dataset labeled with the averaged diagnosis can significantly reduce the risk of misdiagnosis and ensure a more diverse and representative dataset [7].

Addressing the underrepresentation of certain subgroups in medical imaging datasets is another critical aspect of enhancing diversity. For instance, diagnostic accuracy is often poorer for images of darker skin tones compared to those with lighter skin tones, highlighting the need for more inclusive datasets [4]. Techniques such as synthetic data generation and data augmentation, including methods like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), can help balance the representation of different subgroups. These techniques not only improve the quality and diversity of the training data but also enhance the model's ability to generalize across a wider range of patient populations, ultimately leading to more equitable and effective medical diagnostics.

# 4 Reasoning and Dialogue in Medical AI

## 4.1 Large Language Models in Medical Reasoning

### 4.1.1 Dialogue Analysis for Depression Detection
Dialogue analysis for depression detection has emerged as a critical area within mental health informatics, leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify depressive symptoms in patient-therapist interactions. This section delves into the methodologies and models employed in this domain, focusing on the integration of NLP with clinical insights to enhance the accuracy and reliability of depression detection. Recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly contributed to this field, enabling the extraction of nuanced emotional and cognitive indicators from textual and spoken dialogues. These models can analyze various linguistic features, such as sentiment, lexical choice, and discourse structure, to identify patterns indicative of depression.

One notable approach is the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to develop dialogue systems that can dynamically adapt to the evolving needs of patients during therapy sessions. For instance, the Reinforced Recommendation model for Dialogue topics in psychiatric Disorders (R2D2) transcribes therapy sessions in real-time, predicts therapeutic outcomes, and recommends personalized treatment strategies [13]. This model not only enhances the therapeutic process but also provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of different intervention approaches. By integrating RL with NLP, R2D2 can fine-tune its recommendations based on the specific clinical condition and therapeutic emphasis, thereby improving the overall quality of care.

Moreover, the development of Disorder-Specific Multi-Objective Policies (DISMOP) represents a significant advancement in the field. These policies are pre-trained on large corpora of therapeutic dialogues and fine-tuned using off-policy training to optimize for multiple objectives, such as symptom reduction and patient engagement. DISMOP agents can generate interpretable insights by visualizing the policies fine-tuned for different clinical conditions, offering therapists a deeper understanding of the therapeutic process. This approach not only aids in the detection of depression but also supports the development of more effective and personalized treatment plans, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes.

### 4.1.2 Quantitative and Qualitative Model Evaluation
In the evaluation of multimodal medical models, a dual approach encompassing both quantitative and qualitative assessments is essential to ensure the robustness and reliability of the models. Quantitative evaluation primarily focuses on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, which are crucial for assessing the model's performance on specific tasks such as disease classification, anomaly detection, and treatment recommendation. These metrics provide a clear, objective measure of how well the model performs compared to human experts or other models. For instance, in the context of MedAgent-Pro, quantitative evaluations have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in 2D and 3D multi-modal medical diagnosis, surpassing both general and task-specific models [14]. However, while quantitative metrics are indispensable, they often fail to capture the full spectrum of a model's capabilities, particularly in complex clinical scenarios where interpretability and contextual understanding are paramount.

Qualitative evaluation, on the other hand, delves into the interpretability, reliability, and clinical relevance of the model's outputs. This involves analyzing the model's reasoning processes, the clarity of its explanations, and its ability to provide evidence-based recommendations. Qualitative assessments are often conducted through case studies, expert reviews, and user feedback, which can highlight aspects of the model's performance that quantitative metrics might overlook. For example, MedAgent-Pro's qualitative evaluations have shown that the model not only achieves high accuracy but also provides interpretable and reliable diagnoses, supported by clinical literature and visual evidence [14]. This dual approach ensures that the model's outputs are not only correct but also clinically meaningful and actionable, which is crucial for real-world applications in healthcare.

To further enhance the evaluation process, a comprehensive benchmark like 3MDBench has been developed, which integrates both quantitative and qualitative assessments in a structured framework. This benchmark evaluates models on their ability to handle complex, multi-modal data and to generate reasoning chains that are both factually accurate and clinically relevant [15]. By incorporating real-time ratings and adaptive dialogue, 3MDBench provides a more dynamic and realistic assessment of the model's performance, reflecting the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of clinical settings [16]. This approach not only improves the model's diagnostic precision but also enhances its ability to engage with patients and clinicians, ultimately leading to better clinical outcomes.

### 4.1.3 Enhancing Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful technique to enhance the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical diagnosis. By integrating RL, models such as GMAI-VL-R1 can dynamically adjust their reasoning processes based on feedback, leading to more accurate and reliable diagnostic outcomes [17]. The core idea is to use RL to fine-tune the model's ability to generate intermediate reasoning steps, known as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which enhances the model's interpretability and performance in complex medical scenarios [15]. This approach moves beyond traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) by allowing the model to learn from its own mistakes and successes, thereby improving its ability to handle high-risk clinical decisions.

In the context of medical diagnosis, RL tuning enables the model to develop a deeper understanding of the reasoning process by reinforcing correct reasoning paths and penalizing incorrect ones [15]. For instance, GMAI-VL-R1 leverages a high-quality dataset, GMAI-Reasoning10K, which includes detailed CoT annotations across 12 imaging modalities. This dataset serves as a critical resource for training the model to generate structured and medically grounded explanations. The RL training procedure involves an outcome reward model that evaluates the quality of the reasoning paths, ensuring that the model focuses on relevant and clinically significant information [15]. This process not only improves the model's diagnostic accuracy but also makes its reasoning more transparent and explainable, which is crucial in medical applications.

The integration of RL in MLLMs also addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks, which often evaluate models under constrained conditions and fail to capture the complexity of real-world medical scenarios. By simulating interactive and dynamic environments, RL training provides a more realistic and comprehensive evaluation of the model's reasoning capabilities. For example, the model can be trained to engage in dialogue-driven reasoning, where it generates structured medical reasoning steps before making a diagnosis. This not only enhances the model's ability to handle multi-modal data but also improves its adaptability to new and unseen cases. Overall, the use of RL in medical MLLMs represents a significant step forward in aligning AI systems with evidence-based medical protocols, making them more reliable and trustworthy in clinical settings [14].

## 4.2 Multimodal Data Integration

### 4.2.1 Text and Audio Embeddings for CPS Indicators
Text and audio embeddings play a pivotal role in the identification and assessment of Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS) indicators within multimodal data. Traditional approaches often rely on manual coding, which is labor-intensive and prone to inconsistencies. By leveraging advanced embedding techniques, these models can capture nuanced aspects of CPS, such as communication patterns, emotional states, and cognitive processes, from both textual and auditory data. Text embeddings, derived from large language models (LLMs), provide rich semantic representations that can identify key phrases, sentiments, and logical structures in dialogue. Similarly, audio embeddings extract features from speech, capturing prosodic elements like intonation, stress, and pace, which are crucial for understanding the emotional and cognitive states of participants.

The integration of text and audio embeddings allows for a more holistic and context-aware analysis of CPS interactions. For instance, in educational settings, these embeddings can help identify moments of confusion, collaboration, and leadership within group discussions. By combining these modalities, researchers can gain deeper insights into the dynamics of team problem-solving, enabling the development of more effective intervention strategies. Moreover, the use of multimodal embeddings enhances the robustness of CPS indicator detection, as it compensates for the limitations of single-modality analysis. For example, text embeddings might miss subtle emotional cues that are evident in audio, while audio embeddings alone might struggle to capture complex cognitive processes expressed in text.

Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have further propelled the field forward [14]. Models like SilVar, which supports speech-driven interactions, demonstrate the potential for real-time CPS assessment in various settings, including telehealth and remote learning environments. These models can process and reason through spoken and written data simultaneously, providing continuous and dynamic feedback to participants. However, despite these promising developments, there remains a need for more extensive research to refine the integration of text and audio embeddings, particularly in terms of interpretability and scalability. Future work should focus on developing more sophisticated multimodal architectures and benchmarking frameworks to ensure that these models can reliably and accurately identify CPS indicators across diverse contexts [18].

### 4.2.2 Speech-Driven Medical VLMs
Speech-driven medical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) represent a significant advancement in the integration of speech and visual data for healthcare applications. These models leverage the strengths of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to process and interpret both spoken and visual inputs, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnostics and patient interactions [14]. Unlike traditional text-based VLMs, speech-driven VLMs can facilitate more natural and intuitive communication, particularly beneficial in time-sensitive clinical settings or for patients with visual impairments [19]. This section explores the development and application of speech-driven medical VLMs, focusing on their unique capabilities and the challenges they address [19].

One of the key challenges in developing speech-driven medical VLMs is the need for robust speech recognition and natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities. These models must accurately transcribe and interpret spoken commands and responses, often in noisy clinical environments. Recent advancements in deep learning and reinforcement learning have enabled the creation of models that can handle these complexities. For instance, SilVar-Med, a recently proposed speech-driven medical VLM, demonstrates improved performance in abnormality detection through speech instructions [19]. By integrating text and audio embeddings, SilVar-Med enhances multimodal learning and provides more interpretable reasoning behind its predictions. This is crucial for building trust and ensuring the clinical utility of these models.

Another critical aspect of speech-driven medical VLMs is their potential to improve patient engagement and satisfaction. Interactive dialogue systems, such as those used in psychotherapy, can benefit significantly from speech-driven VLMs by providing real-time feedback and personalized recommendations. The Reinforced Recommendation model for Dialogue topics in psychiatric Disorders (R2D2) exemplifies this approach by transcribing therapy sessions, predicting therapeutic outcomes, and suggesting optimal treatment strategies [13]. Additionally, the use of speech-driven VLMs in telemedicine and remote patient monitoring can streamline consultations and enhance accessibility, particularly for patients in rural or underserved areas. Overall, the development of speech-driven medical VLMs represents a promising direction in AI-driven healthcare, offering enhanced diagnostic accuracy and improved patient care.

### 4.2.3 Adaptive Dialogues and Multimodal Reasoning
Adaptive dialogues and multimodal reasoning represent a significant advancement in the capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), particularly in the medical domain [14]. These models are designed to integrate various forms of input, including text, images, and speech, to provide more comprehensive and contextually relevant responses. The integration of multimodal data allows MLLMs to better understand the nuances of patient interactions, leading to more accurate and personalized diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations. For instance, in medical vision question answering (MedVQA), MLLMs can analyze both textual queries and visual data, such as X-rays or MRI scans, to provide detailed and accurate answers [14]. This capability is crucial in clinical settings where the diagnosis often relies on the synthesis of multiple data sources.

To enhance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, several approaches have been proposed, including the development of specialized models and the integration of reinforcement learning (RL). One notable example is the MedAgent-Pro framework, which leverages RL to fine-tune MLLMs with medical guidelines and expert tools, enabling them to perform evidence-based medical diagnosis [14]. This approach not only improves the accuracy of the models but also ensures that their recommendations align with current medical protocols. Additionally, the introduction of DisorderSpecific Multi-Objective Policies (DISMOP) further refines the decision-making process by training reinforcement learning agents to optimize for specific clinical conditions and therapeutic goals [13]. These agents are pre-trained on large corpora of medical dialogues and then fine-tuned using off-policy training, allowing them to adapt to new and evolving medical scenarios.

Despite the progress, challenges remain in fully realizing the potential of adaptive dialogues and multimodal reasoning in medical AI [19]. One key challenge is the integration of speech-driven interactions, which are underexplored in current models. The SilVar-Med model, an end-to-end speech-instructed medical VLM, addresses this gap by enabling users to interact with the model verbally, thereby enhancing the naturalness and accessibility of the dialogue. Another challenge is the evaluation of these models, which requires benchmarks that assess both medical knowledge and diagnostic dialogue accuracy [16]. The 3MDBench benchmark, designed for this purpose, evaluates LVLMs across various tasks, including diagnostic reasoning and interactive dialogue, highlighting the importance of structured medical reasoning in improving diagnostic quality [16]. These advancements underscore the ongoing efforts to develop more sophisticated and clinically relevant MLLMs that can effectively support healthcare professionals in their decision-making processes.

## 4.3 Reinforcement Learning in Medical AI

### 4.3.1 On-Policy and Off-Policy Training
On-Policy and Off-Policy training methods are fundamental to the development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, particularly in the context of medical decision-making and therapy. On-Policy methods, such as SARSA and REINFORCE, learn the value of actions based on the policy that is currently being used to make decisions. These methods are particularly useful in scenarios where the actions taken during training are directly influenced by the policy being learned, ensuring that the model's decisions are continually updated based on the most recent policy. However, on-policy methods can be sample-inefficient, as they require a significant amount of data to converge, and they are sensitive to the initial policy, which can lead to suboptimal solutions if the initial policy is poor.

In contrast, Off-Policy methods, such as Q-learning and DQN, allow the model to learn from historical data that was generated by a different policy, making them more sample-efficient and adaptable to a variety of data sources. This is particularly advantageous in medical applications, where historical data from patient interactions, such as psychotherapy sessions, can be leveraged to train models without the need for extensive new data collection. Off-Policy methods can also incorporate post-hoc reward signals, which can be computed using computational inference to align the learned policies with specific therapeutic goals, such as improving patient bonding or targeting specific disorders [13]. This flexibility enables the development of Disorder-Specific Multi-Objective Policies (DISMOP), which can be fine-tuned for different clinical conditions and therapeutic emphases, thereby enhancing the personalization and effectiveness of AI-driven therapy companions.

The integration of on-policy and off-policy training in medical AI systems, such as MedAgent-Pro, can lead to more robust and reliable models. By combining the strengths of both approaches, these systems can benefit from the continuous learning and adaptability of on-policy methods while leveraging the efficiency and flexibility of off-policy methods. For instance, pre-training on a large corpus of medical dialogues using off-policy methods can provide a strong initial policy, which can then be fine-tuned using on-policy methods to adapt to specific clinical scenarios and patient needs. This hybrid approach not only improves the overall performance and reliability of the AI system but also ensures that it remains aligned with evidence-based medical protocols and clinical guidelines, thereby enhancing its utility in real-world medical decision-making.

### 4.3.2 Policy Visualization and Interpretability
Policy visualization and interpretability are crucial for ensuring the transparency and trustworthiness of AI systems in medical applications, particularly in the context of MedAgent-Pro. By visualizing the policies that govern the decision-making processes of these AI agents, researchers and practitioners can gain deeper insights into how and why certain diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations are made. This section delves into the methods and techniques used to visualize and interpret the policies of MedAgent-Pro, focusing on the DisorderSpecific Multi-Objective Policies (DISMOP) framework [13].

The DISMOP framework employs reinforcement learning to fine-tune policies for specific clinical conditions and therapeutic emphases. These policies are pre-trained on a large corpus of medical dialogues and then fine-tuned using off-policy training to adapt to specific therapeutic contexts. The visualization of these policies involves mapping the decision-making process into a comprehensible format, such as decision trees, heatmaps, or state-action diagrams. These visualizations help in identifying the key factors and conditions that influence the AI's recommendations, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the model. For instance, heatmaps can show the relative importance of different symptoms or patient characteristics in the decision-making process, while decision trees can illustrate the sequence of decisions leading to a particular recommendation.

To further enhance interpretability, MedAgent-Pro integrates explainable AI (XAI) techniques that provide detailed explanations for each policy decision [20]. These explanations can be generated in natural language, making it easier for healthcare professionals to understand and validate the AI's reasoning [21]. Additionally, the framework supports the adaptive updating of policies based on therapeutic rewards, such as the computational inferred working alliance between the therapist and the patient [13]. This dynamic updating ensures that the policies remain relevant and effective over time, while the visualizations and explanations provide a transparent and accountable decision-making process. Overall, the combination of policy visualization and XAI techniques in MedAgent-Pro not only improves the model's performance but also fosters trust and collaboration between AI systems and human healthcare providers.

### 4.3.3 Evidence-Based Multi-Modal Diagnosis
Evidence-based multi-modal diagnosis represents a critical advancement in the field of medical informatics, leveraging the integration of diverse data types to enhance diagnostic accuracy and reliability. This approach combines textual, imaging, and other sensor-derived data to provide a holistic view of a patient's condition, facilitating more informed clinical decisions. MedAgent-Pro, a sophisticated agentic system, exemplifies this paradigm by incorporating medical guidelines and expert tools to process multi-modal patient information [14]. Through a structured reasoning workflow, MedAgent-Pro not only executes diagnostic tasks but also provides interpretable qualitative and quantitative analyses, thereby supporting evidence-based decision-making at the case level [14]. This system is particularly adept at handling both 2D and 3D medical data, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal medical diagnosis [14].

The core of MedAgent-Pro's effectiveness lies in its ability to incentivize reasoning capabilities through the integration of medical guidelines and expert tools. By fine-tuning policies specific to different clinical conditions and therapeutic emphases, MedAgent-Pro ensures that its diagnostic processes are aligned with modern medical protocols. This is achieved through a combination of reinforcement learning and off-policy training, allowing the system to learn from historical data and adapt to new scenarios. The use of post hoc reward signals further enhances the system's ability to generate disorder-specific and therapeutically focused policies, thereby improving the precision and relevance of its diagnostic outputs. This approach not only addresses the limitations of empirical question-answering systems but also provides a robust framework for evidence-based multi-modal diagnosis.

To further validate the efficacy of evidence-based multi-modal diagnosis, the development of benchmarks and evaluation metrics is essential. 3MDBench, a Medical Multimodal Multi-agent Dialogue Benchmark, serves this purpose by assessing the diagnostic accuracy and reasoning capabilities of AI systems in telemedicine settings [16]. This benchmark evaluates how well models can integrate and reason over multi-modal data, including text and images, to diagnose patient conditions accurately. Additionally, the introduction of a novel evaluation metric that leverages large language models (LLMs) as judges helps in assessing the reasoning quality of medical vision-language models (VLMs). These advancements collectively contribute to the robustness and reliability of multi-modal diagnostic systems, paving the way for more effective and personalized healthcare solutions.

# 5 Diagnostic Accuracy and Interpretability

## 5.1 Topology-Guided Generative Models

### 5.1.1 Anatomical and Tumor Morphological Integration
Anatomical and tumor morphological integration represents a critical frontier in the development of advanced medical imaging and AI-driven diagnostic tools. This integration aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of disease diagnosis by leveraging detailed anatomical information alongside tumor characteristics. For instance, in the context of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), tools like Retuve utilize both ultrasound and X-ray imaging to generate precise anatomical indices, such as the acetabular alpha angle and acetabular index, which are crucial for diagnosing DDH [22]. These indices not only provide a standardized method for assessing hip anatomy but also serve as valuable training data for AI models, thereby improving the robustness and reproducibility of DDH diagnostics [22].

In oncology, the integration of anatomical and tumor morphological data is equally vital. Traditional imaging techniques often struggle to capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of tumors, leading to suboptimal diagnostic outcomes. Advanced AI models, particularly those incorporating explainable AI (XAI) techniques like Grad-CAM++, have shown promise in addressing these limitations [10]. By focusing attention on specific anatomical features and tumor regions, these models can enhance the interpretability and clinical confidence in tumor detection and classification [10]. However, the challenge lies in maintaining the topological consistency of the generated anatomical structures, especially in regions where tumor morphology varies significantly across patients [23]. This variability necessitates the development of sophisticated models that can adapt to diverse anatomical contexts while preserving the integrity of the tumor structures [23].

To achieve this, recent research has explored the use of diffusion-based models, which can generate high-fidelity images that maintain the intricate structural relationships between anatomical regions and tumors [23]. These models are conditioned on detailed anatomical inputs, ensuring that the synthesized images remain clinically relevant and interpretable. Additionally, the introduction of modules like the Tumor-Structure Aggregation Module helps integrate multiple anatomical structures and tumor morphology, further enhancing the model's ability to produce realistic and accurate representations. This approach not only improves the diagnostic accuracy of AI models but also paves the way for more personalized and effective treatment planning in clinical settings [21].

### 5.1.2 Topological Consistency in MRI Sequences
Topological consistency in MRI sequences is crucial for ensuring that the generated images not only visually resemble real MRI scans but also maintain the correct anatomical and structural relationships. In the context of brain MRI, this involves preserving the intricate topological features of brain tissues, particularly in regions with complex structures such as tumors. The preservation of these features is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning, as subtle topological discrepancies can lead to misinterpretation and erroneous clinical decisions.

To achieve topological consistency, recent advancements in deep learning have focused on integrating topological information into the generative models used for MRI sequence synthesis. One such approach involves the use of diffusion models, which are capable of learning the complex distributions of MRI data and generating high-fidelity images. These models are trained to iteratively denoise and reconstruct the MRI sequences, ensuring that the generated images maintain the topological integrity of the original data. A key innovation in this area is the introduction of a Structure-Aware Topology Module, which computes persistence diagrams (PDs) from the masked tumor regions within the MRI sequences [23]. The PDs capture the topological features of the tumor, such as the number and size of connected components and holes, and serve as a conditional input to the diffusion model, guiding the generation process to produce anatomically coherent images [23].

To further enhance topological consistency, a topology-preserving loss function is employed during the training of the diffusion model [23]. This loss function penalizes deviations from the expected topological features, ensuring that the generated MRI sequences not only look realistic but also retain the correct structural relationships. This approach has been shown to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of synthetic MRI sequences, making them more suitable for clinical applications such as tumor segmentation, diagnosis, and treatment planning. By addressing the challenges of topological variability and ensuring structural fidelity, these models pave the way for more robust and clinically relevant medical imaging solutions.

### 5.1.3 Enhancing Structural Accuracy
Enhancing structural accuracy in medical imaging analysis is crucial for improving the diagnostic reliability and clinical utility of AI models. One of the primary methods to achieve this is through the use of advanced segmentation techniques that can accurately delineate anatomical structures from imaging data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been particularly effective in this regard, especially when pre-trained on large datasets and fine-tuned for specific tasks such as skeletal muscle segmentation in CT scans or brain tumor detection in MRI [24]. These models can capture intricate structural details and variations, leading to more precise and reliable segmentations.

To further enhance structural accuracy, recent approaches have integrated anatomical knowledge into the model training process. For instance, the use of topology-preserving loss functions ensures that the generated images not only appear realistic but also maintain the correct anatomical relationships and structural integrity. This is particularly important in applications such as synthetic MRI generation, where the preservation of tumor regions and other critical structures is essential for clinical diagnosis. By enforcing these constraints, models can produce outputs that are both visually convincing and clinically accurate, thereby improving their utility in real-world medical settings.

Another key aspect of enhancing structural accuracy is the use of explainability techniques to validate and improve model performance. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is one such technique that has gained prominence in medical imaging [10]. Grad-CAM helps in identifying the regions of the input image that are most influential in the model's decision-making process, providing insights into the model's focus and helping to identify potential errors or biases. This transparency is crucial for building trust in AI models and ensuring that they are making accurate and reliable predictions based on the correct anatomical features. By combining these advanced techniques, researchers can develop more robust and clinically relevant AI models for medical imaging analysis.

## 5.2 Deep Learning for Tumor Detection and Classification

### 5.2.1 Evaluating Pre-Trained Models
Evaluating pre-trained models is a critical step in the development and deployment of machine learning systems, especially in medical imaging applications where accuracy and reliability are paramount. Pre-trained models, often initialized with weights learned from large-scale datasets like ImageNet, serve as a foundation for fine-tuning on smaller, task-specific datasets. This approach leverages the general features learned from extensive data, potentially improving performance on specialized tasks such as brain tumor detection or skeletal muscle assessment. However, the effectiveness of pre-trained models can vary significantly depending on the domain and the specific task at hand. Recent studies have highlighted the limitations of using natural image pre-training for medical imaging tasks, suggesting that within-domain transfer learning, where pre-training is conducted on similar medical datasets, often yields better results [10].

One key aspect of evaluating pre-trained models is the development of comprehensive performance metrics that go beyond traditional accuracy measures. For instance, the Heat-Score, a novel metric derived from heatmaps generated by Grad-CAM, provides a quantitative assessment of the model's attention to clinically relevant regions. This metric complements traditional accuracy metrics by ensuring that the model not only classifies images correctly but also focuses on the correct anatomical features. Such a balanced evaluation framework is crucial for ensuring that the model's decisions are both accurate and clinically meaningful, thereby enhancing its reliability in real-world applications.

Another critical factor in the evaluation of pre-trained models is the reproducibility and transparency of the research process. The availability of open datasets, such as MIMIC-III and OpenML, has significantly improved the ability to validate models across diverse populations and settings [22]. Leading conferences like MICCAI and ICML have further emphasized the importance of open data and data-centric AI, encouraging the sharing of datasets and pre-trained models to foster collaboration and advance the field [22]. Despite these efforts, challenges remain, particularly in the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and the need for robust uncertainty estimation methods. Addressing these issues will be essential for the continued improvement and clinical adoption of pre-trained models in medical imaging.

### 5.2.2 Custom Deep Neural Networks
Custom deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool in medical imaging, particularly for tasks such as brain tumor classification and segmentation [25]. Unlike pre-trained models, which are often optimized for general image recognition tasks, custom DNNs can be tailored to the specific characteristics and requirements of medical datasets [25]. This customization allows for the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge, leading to improved performance and interpretability. For instance, in brain tumor classification, custom DNNs can be designed to focus on specific features such as tumor boundaries, texture, and intensity variations, which are crucial for accurate diagnosis [25]. Additionally, custom architectures can be optimized to handle the unique challenges of medical imaging, such as high variability in image quality and the presence of artifacts.

One of the key advantages of custom DNNs is their ability to integrate advanced architectural components that enhance their performance. For example, attention mechanisms can be incorporated to highlight relevant regions within the image, improving the model's focus on critical areas. Similarly, multi-scale architectures can be employed to capture both local and global features, which is particularly beneficial in tasks involving complex anatomical structures. Furthermore, the use of residual connections and skip connections can help mitigate issues related to vanishing gradients and improve the training efficiency of deep networks. These design choices not only enhance the model's accuracy but also contribute to its robustness and generalization capabilities, making it more suitable for clinical applications.

Despite the potential benefits, the development of custom DNNs also presents several challenges. One major challenge is the need for large, well-annotated datasets to train these models effectively. In the medical domain, such datasets are often scarce and expensive to obtain, which can limit the performance of custom DNNs. Additionally, the design and optimization of custom architectures require significant expertise and computational resources, which may not be readily available in all research settings. To address these challenges, researchers are exploring strategies such as transfer learning, where pre-trained models are fine-tuned on smaller medical datasets, and data augmentation techniques to artificially expand the training set. These approaches aim to strike a balance between the benefits of custom DNNs and the practical constraints of medical imaging research.

### 5.2.3 Optimization Techniques for Diagnostic Accuracy
Optimization techniques play a crucial role in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning models, particularly in medical imaging applications such as automated DDH detection. One of the primary approaches involves the use of advanced loss functions that better capture the nuances of medical images. For instance, topology-preserving loss functions ensure that the structural fidelity of anatomical regions, such as the hip joint, is maintained during the training process. This is particularly important in conditions like DDH, where subtle changes in the acetabular index or alpha angle can significantly impact the diagnosis. By enforcing these constraints, the models can achieve higher accuracy and robustness, even when dealing with noisy or low-quality images.

Another key optimization technique is the integration of explainable AI (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, to enhance the interpretability of the models. Grad-CAM generates heatmaps that highlight the regions of the input image most influential in the model's decision-making process. This not only improves the transparency of the model but also increases clinical confidence by allowing clinicians to verify the model's focus on relevant anatomical features. For example, in the context of DDH detection, Grad-CAM can help identify the specific areas of the hip joint that the model is analyzing, thereby facilitating a more informed and collaborative diagnostic process between AI and human experts.

Finally, the use of uncertainty quantification techniques is essential for improving the reliability of diagnostic models. These techniques, such as threshold-based mechanisms, allow the model to estimate its own uncertainty in predictions, which is particularly valuable in clinical settings where the consequences of incorrect diagnoses can be severe. By identifying and flagging cases with high uncertainty, the model can alert clinicians to potential issues, prompting further manual review or additional diagnostic tests. This hybrid approach combines the strengths of AI with human expertise, ensuring that the final diagnosis is both accurate and trustworthy. Together, these optimization techniques contribute to the development of more robust and clinically viable diagnostic tools, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes.

## 5.3 Interpretative Techniques in Medical Imaging

### 5.3.1 Heatmap-Based Interpretation for FCD Detection
Heatmap-based interpretation techniques, particularly Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), have emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing the interpretability of deep learning models in FCD (Focal Cortical Dysplasia) detection. By generating heatmaps that highlight the regions of an image most relevant to the model's decision-making process, Grad-CAM provides a visual explanation of the model's predictions. This transparency is crucial in medical diagnostics, where understanding the rationale behind a model's output can significantly increase clinical trust and adoption [20]. In the context of FCD detection, Grad-CAM has been applied to both 2D and 3D imaging modalities, such as MRI and CT scans, to identify the specific areas of the brain that are most indicative of FCD. These heatmaps can help radiologists and neurologists to focus their attention on the most salient regions, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of the diagnostic process.

The application of heatmap-based techniques in FCD detection also addresses the challenge of model interpretability, which is a significant barrier to the clinical acceptance of deep learning models [10]. By providing a clear and intuitive visualization of the model's decision-making process, heatmaps can facilitate the validation and verification of AI models. For instance, in a study comparing multiple deep learning architectures for FCD detection, Grad-CAM was used to generate heatmaps that highlighted the regions of the brain that the model deemed most important for classification. These heatmaps were then compared with the annotations provided by expert radiologists, revealing a high degree of overlap and confirming the model's ability to focus on the correct anatomical regions. This level of transparency not only enhances the model's credibility but also provides valuable insights into the underlying pathology, potentially leading to improved diagnostic accuracy and more personalized treatment plans.

Moreover, the integration of heatmap-based interpretation techniques with cross-modality transfer learning has shown promising results in enhancing the robustness and generalizability of FCD detection models [10]. By leveraging pre-trained models from one imaging modality to improve performance on another, cross-modality transfer learning can help overcome the limitations of small and imbalanced datasets [10]. In this context, heatmaps generated by techniques like Grad-CAM can serve as a bridge between different imaging modalities, providing a consistent and interpretable representation of the model's decision-making process. This approach not only improves the model's performance but also facilitates the clinical validation of AI models by ensuring that the model's predictions are grounded in clinically relevant features. As the field of medical AI continues to evolve, the combination of heatmap-based interpretation and cross-modality transfer learning is expected to play a pivotal role in advancing the clinical utility of deep learning models for FCD detection.

### 5.3.2 Radiomics and Deep Learning Comparison
Radiomics and deep learning (DL) have emerged as two powerful methodologies for extracting meaningful features from medical images, each with its unique strengths and limitations [2]. Radiomics involves the extraction of a large number of quantitative features from medical images, which are then used to build predictive models. These features, often derived from texture, shape, and intensity, can provide detailed insights into the underlying biology of diseases. However, the process of feature selection and extraction in radiomics is often manual and requires significant domain expertise, which can be a bottleneck in the development and validation of radiomic models.

In contrast, deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), automate the feature extraction process through end-to-end learning. DL models can learn complex and hierarchical representations directly from raw image data, making them highly effective in tasks such as tumor detection, segmentation, and classification. The ability of DL models to generalize from large datasets and their capacity to capture intricate patterns in images have led to significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy. However, the "black-box" nature of DL models, where the decision-making process is often opaque, can be a significant barrier to their clinical adoption, especially in scenarios where interpretability is crucial.

Despite these differences, there is a growing trend towards integrating radiomics and deep learning to leverage the strengths of both approaches. For instance, radiomic features can be used to guide the training of DL models, providing additional context that can improve model performance and interpretability. Conversely, DL models can be used to automate the extraction of radiomic features, reducing the need for manual feature engineering. This hybrid approach has shown promise in various medical imaging applications, including the detection and classification of tumors, and is expected to play a crucial role in the future of medical diagnostics.

### 5.3.3 Enhancing Transparency and Confidence
Enhancing transparency and confidence in AI-driven medical research is crucial for ensuring the reliability and trustworthiness of these systems [22]. Transparency involves making the data, methodologies, and algorithms used in AI research openly accessible, allowing for independent verification and replication of results. In the medical domain, where the stakes are particularly high, this transparency is essential for building trust among clinicians, patients, and regulatory bodies. Open data initiatives, such as MIMIC-III and OpenML, have played a pivotal role in this regard by providing large, well-curated datasets that can be used to validate and refine AI models [22]. These platforms not only facilitate the sharing of data but also promote the standardization of evaluation metrics and experimental protocols, thereby enhancing the comparability and reproducibility of research findings.

Another key aspect of enhancing transparency is the use of explainable AI (XAI) techniques, which aim to make the decision-making processes of AI models more interpretable. Techniques such as Grad-CAM, which highlight the regions of an input image that most influence the model's predictions, have been particularly useful in medical imaging applications. For instance, in the context of tumor detection, Grad-CAM can help identify the specific anatomical features that the model is focusing on, thereby improving the clinical confidence in the model's outputs. However, while these methods provide valuable insights, they often lack quantitative measures to assess the accuracy of the explanations. Future research could explore the integration of other XAI methods, such as SHAP values and positive-gradient-weighted approaches, to provide a more comprehensive and robust interpretation of model decisions.

Finally, enhancing confidence in AI models also requires addressing the issue of dataset accessibility and diversity. Many medical AI studies suffer from limited access to high-quality, diverse datasets, which can lead to biased and less generalizable models [22]. Pre-trained models, which have been trained on large, heterogeneous datasets, can serve as a foundation for fine-tuning on smaller, task-specific datasets, thereby improving model performance and reducing the need for extensive data collection at individual centers [10]. Additionally, the reuse of pre-trained models can help preserve prior computational investments and accelerate the development of new applications [10]. By combining open data initiatives, XAI techniques, and the strategic use of pre-trained models, the medical AI community can significantly enhance the transparency and confidence in AI-driven solutions, paving the way for their broader adoption in clinical practice.

# 6 Future Directions


The current landscape of AI-driven EEG-based schizophrenia diagnosis, while promising, is not without its limitations and gaps. One of the primary challenges is the variability and noise inherent in EEG data, which can significantly affect the performance of machine learning models. Despite advances in feature extraction techniques, such as dynamic window mechanisms and channel and spatial attention mechanisms, there remains a need for more robust methods to handle the high variability and noise levels in EEG signals. Additionally, the reliance on large, well-annotated datasets is a significant bottleneck, as such datasets are often scarce and expensive to generate. This limitation hinders the generalizability and reliability of the models, particularly in real-world clinical settings where data quality and quantity can vary widely. Furthermore, the interpretability of AI models in this domain remains a critical issue.

This could involve the integration of domain-specific knowledge and the exploration of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methods to improve the quality of EEG signals. Secondly, the development of more efficient and scalable methods for generating and annotating large EEG datasets is crucial. This could be achieved through the use of synthetic data generation techniques, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), and the integration of crowdsourcing platforms to facilitate data labeling. Additionally, the exploration of transfer learning and few-shot learning techniques could help in leveraging pre-trained models to improve performance on smaller, task-specific datasets. Thirdly, enhancing the interpretability of AI models is essential for their clinical adoption. This could involve the development of explainable AI (XAI) techniques that provide clear and understandable explanations of the model's decision-making process. Techniques such as gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) and attention mechanisms could be further refined to offer more detailed insights into the model's focus and reasoning.

The potential impact of the proposed future work is substantial. By developing more robust and interpretable AI models for EEG-based schizophrenia diagnosis, we can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of diagnostic tools, leading to better patient outcomes. Enhanced noise reduction and signal enhancement techniques will make the models more resilient to variations in data quality, ensuring consistent performance across different clinical settings. The availability of large, well-annotated datasets will facilitate the training of more generalized models, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the model's ability to handle new and unseen data. Moreover, the integration of XAI techniques will build trust and confidence among clinicians, accelerating the adoption of AI-driven diagnostic tools in routine clinical practice. Ultimately, these advancements have the potential to transform the landscape of schizophrenia diagnosis, enabling earlier and more accurate detection, and thereby improving the quality of life for patients and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
