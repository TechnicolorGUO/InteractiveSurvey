# 1. Introduction  

Bacteriophages (phages), viruses that specifically infect bacteria, represent the most abundant biological entities on Earth and serve fundamental roles in global ecosystems [12,15]. Their ecological functions encompass gene-to-gene communication, maintaining microbial diversity, and participating in crucial biogeochemical cycles [15]. Beyond their ecological significance, phages are increasingly recognized for their practical applications in diverse fields such as ecology, therapy, microbiome research, diagnostics, biotechnology, and food safety [22]. Notably, phages hold significant promise in addressing the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance, serving as potential therapeutic agents in phage therapy [9,26,35]. Their role in shaping bacterial evolution and potential applications in synthetic biology further underscore the importance of understanding phage biology and diversity [15].​  

Accurate classification of phages is a prerequisite for unlocking their full potential in these varied applications [4,12].  

However, classifying phages presents inherent difficulties [3,13]. These challenges stem from their immense diversity in size, morphology, and genomic organization [12], coupled with complex genomic structures characterized by high genetic diversity, rapid evolutionary rates, high recombination rates, and pervasive genome mosaicism resulting from horizontal gene transfer [2,13]. The lack of universally conserved genes further complicates traditional classification efforts [2].  

Historically, phage classification relied primarily on phenotypic characteristics such as morphology determined by electron microscopy, host range, and serological properties [4]. The advent of advanced sequencing technologies, particularly second-generation sequencing, has revolutionized biology by providing unprecedented access to viral genomes, including those from uncultivated sources like environmental or host-associated metagenomes [2,13]. This technological shift has driven a transition from morphology-based methods towards genomics-driven classification approaches [4,13]. The official taxonomy, curated by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), increasingly incorporates genomic data for classification, reflecting this paradigm shift [12]. Recent updates to the ICTV system, such as the reorganization of major tailed dsDNA phage families, highlight the dynamic nature of phage taxonomy in the genomic era [12].​  

Despite the wealth of genomic data, the inherent challenges of phage diversity, mosaicism, and the sheer volume of data, especially from metagenomic studies, necessitate computational solutions [2]. Identifying viral sequences and classifying them accurately within complex metagenomic datasets remains a significant hurdle [2]. Computational tools play a crucial role in overcoming the limitations of traditional and manual genomic analyses, enabling more efficient and accurate classification by integrating diverse features like sequence alignment, structural characteristics, and machine learning techniques [2].​  

This survey aims to provide a structured and comprehensive review of existing computational tools for phage classification [12]. We discuss their underlying principles, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and explore their typical applications. The review is structured to present major categories of phage classification tools, detailing their methodologies and performance. Evaluation considerations, including various performance metrics relevant to machine learning applications in genomics, will be discussed to provide a framework for comparing tool efficacy [17].

Historically, phage classification primarily relied on observable physical and biological characteristics. Early systems included morphology-based classification and the Baltimore classification system [4].  

Morphology-based classification was a cornerstone of early phage taxonomy, particularly for tailed phages which constitute the majority of known phages [26]. This approach categorized phages based on the visual characteristics of their virions, predominantly using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [4,18]. Key morphological features included the presence or absence of a tail, and for tailed phages, the shape, length, and presence of a contractile sheath [4,26]. This led to the establishment of prominent families within the order Caudovirales, namely Myoviridae (contractile tails), Podoviridae (short tails), and Siphoviridae (long, non-contractile tails) [4,13,26]. For instance, a phage isolated from E.coliwas classified into the Myoviridae family based on its icosahedral head and contractile tail observed via electron microscopy, with specific dimensions reported (head diameter ${ \sim } 6 0 \mathsf { n m }$ , tail length $\mathord { \sim } 1 5 0 \mathsf { n m }$ ) [9]. Microscopy techniques like TEM, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and epifluorescence microscopy (EFM) were also employed for direct observation and counting of viruslike particles (VLPs) in various samples, though their effectiveness in quantifying phages in complex environments like the gut was limited [18]. These morphological categories provided an initial framework for organizing phage diversity, with these families remaining relevant today [26].​  

Beyond morphology, early identification and characterization also relied on biological properties, notably host range and culture-based methods. Phage identification and quantification historically utilized culture-based isolation on specific host strains [18]. This involved observing and counting plaques formed by phage lysis on bacterial lawns on solid media [18], a method fundamental to determining which bacterial strains a phage could infect. Other biological features, such as being Mu-like, T4-like, T7-like, or lambdoid, were also used to group phages [13].  

While morphology-based and culture-dependent methods were instrumental in the early stages of phage research, they possessed significant limitations. A major drawback was the inability to classify phages that could not be cultured invitro, a substantial portion of the environmental phageome [4]. Furthermore, morphological characteristics did not always reliably correlate with evolutionary relationships, leading to difficulties in accurately reflecting phage phylogeny [4]. These methods were also often subjective, particularly in the interpretation of fine morphological details, and suffered from low throughput, making large-scale classification challenging. The reliance on morphological features, while useful for initial description, proved inadequate for resolving complex taxonomic relationships or for classifying unicellular organisms effectively [10]. Consequently, by 2022, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) acknowledged these limitations and decided that morphology should primarily serve as a descriptive feature rather than a direct basis for classification, emphasizing the need to incorporate genomic and proteomic data as primary taxonomic criteria [4,13].  

The limitations of traditional methods prompted a transition towards molecular approaches. Early molecular techniques included DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH), which compared the overall similarity of genomes by measuring the degree of hybridization between denatured DNA strands from different organisms [10]. Although DDH was considered a "gold standard" for bacterial taxonomy for a period, it was technically demanding, onerous, and had limited resolution for closely related strains or distinguishing species boundaries effectively [10]. Despite its limitations, DNA hybridization represented a significant historical step, marking a move towards molecular-based metrics and serving as a precursor to the highthroughput genome sequencing methods that would later revolutionize phage classification.  

# 3. Genomic/Sequence-Based Phage Classification  

Advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies have positioned genomic and sequence-based methods as the cornerstone of modern phage classification [2,4]. These approaches leverage the wealth of genetic information available for phages to infer taxonomic relationships, identify functional characteristics, and understand evolutionary histories. Unlike traditional methods that rely on morphological or phenotypic traits, sequence-based classification offers high resolution and is particularly critical for analyzing uncultivated phages from diverse environments, such as those revealed through metagenomics [3,18].​  

![](images/15aaa032cb36cd7d835c8822b729afe59368a5b48552c0aeea7d788cfe858320.jpg)  

Sequence-based classification encompasses a variety of computational techniques that analyze DNA or protein sequences. These methods can be broadly categorized based on the type of sequence information they utilize and the underlying algorithms. Alignment-based methods assess similarity by aligning query sequences against known databases, employing tools like BLAST and Diamond to find homologous regions [2,7,12]. While powerful for identifying related sequences and used in tools like PhaBOX [7] and integrated systems like G-InforBIO [21], their effectiveness diminishes significantly for highly divergent or novel phages that lack substantial sequence similarity to existing entries [2].  

Composition-based methods, conversely, rely on statistical properties of sequences, such as k-mer frequencies and GC content [2,9,10]. These alignment-free techniques, implemented in tools like Kraken2 and VirFinder [5,28], are computationally efficient and better suited for classifying short reads and novel sequences found in large metagenomic datasets [2]. However, their discriminatory power can be limited, particularly at finer taxonomic levels, and their performance can be influenced by factors like sequencing depth [16].​  

Gene content methods analyze the presence or absence of specific genes or gene families (core vs. pan-genome) to define taxonomic groups and infer evolutionary relationships [13]. Identifying phylogenetic marker genes, which are conserved genes assumed to reflect vertical evolutionary history, is a key component of this approach [4,25]. Markers like the terminase large subunit or capsid protein are commonly used, often in concatenated alignments for phylogenetic tree construction [4,9,11]. Phylogenetic analysis based on these markers provides insights into evolutionary history [4].  

However, the prevalence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in phage genomes complicates gene content and marker-based analyses, as different genes may have distinct evolutionary histories [18].  

Whole-genome comparison methods provide a high-resolution view by analyzing the entire genome sequence or its encoded proteome [13]. Metrics like Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and analyses of gene order (synteny) are used to define species boundaries and identify larger-scale genomic rearrangements [3,10,11]. ANI, with thresholds typically around $\geq 9 5 \%$ for species delineation [3,10,11], is a robust measure for closely related genomes. Gene sharing profiles and network-based approaches, implemented in tools like vConTACT and VirClust [12,13], cluster genomes based on shared protein content, offering insights into genus- or family-level relationships. These methods offer detailed insights but are computationally intensive, particularly for large and diverse datasets [10].​  

In summary, sequence-based phage classification employs a diverse toolkit, ranging from similarity-based alignment and statistical composition analysis to sophisticated gene content and whole-genome comparisons. Each approach possesses unique strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different classification tasks and genomic datasets. The challenges posed by high genomic diversity, mosaicism, HGT, and the abundance of novel sequences [2] necessitate the integration and complementary application of these methods for comprehensive and accurate phage classification. Benchmarking studies highlight variability in tool performance across different datasets and classification levels [5,16], underscoring the importance of selecting appropriate methods and reference databases for specific research questions.  

# 3.1 Alignment-Based Methods  

Alignment-based methods represent a foundational approach to classifying phages, relying on the principle of determining sequence similarity between unknown phage sequences and known sequences stored in comprehensive databases [2]. This similarity is assessed through sequence alignment algorithms, which identify conserved regions, homologous genes, or overall genomic relatedness. The degree and pattern of similarity are then used to infer taxonomic relationships or assign functions [7,9,12,29].​  

Various alignment algorithms are employed, each with its characteristics regarding speed, sensitivity, and suitability for different tasks [2]. Generally, alignment methods can be broadly categorized into local and global approaches, as well as heuristic and exact algorithms. Local alignment, exemplified by tools like BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) and Diamond, is particularly effective for identifying regions of similarity between sequences that may otherwise be largely unrelated, which is common in diverse viral genomes [2]. BLAST, a widely used heuristic algorithm, sacrifices some sensitivity for speed, making it suitable for searching large databases. Diamond is a faster alternative to BLAST, particularly for protein sequence comparisons [2]. Other related tools include Blat, DDBJ Blast, and MegaBLAST, offering varying tradeoffs and specific applications [21]. Global alignment, such as Needleman-Wunsch, aims to align sequences end-to-end and is more appropriate for closely related sequences of similar length. Exact algorithms guarantee finding the optimal alignment but are computationally intensive, limiting their use for extensive database searches compared to heuristic methods. Multiple sequence alignment tools, such as MultAlin and Clustal Omega/W, are also crucial for aligning multiple related sequences simultaneously to identify conserved patterns and support phylogenetic analyses [13,21].​  

The interpretation of statistical parameters is critical for determining the significance and reliability of alignment matches [2]. Key parameters include E-value (Expectation value) and score thresholds. The E-value estimates the number of matches one would expect to see by chance in a database of a particular size. Lower E-values indicate more statistically significant matches. Score thresholds represent the raw alignment score required for a match to be considered relevant. Other parameters like query coverage and percent identity are also frequently used to filter results and define relatedness thresholds, for instance, in calculating Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) which relies on aligning fragments and requiring minimum identity and coverage [10,13]. Adequate filtering based on these parameters is essential to minimize misclassification, especially when dealing with complex metagenomic data [16].​  

Despite their utility, alignment-based methods face significant challenges when classifying highly divergent or novel phages that share limited homology with sequences in current databases [2]. These methods fundamentally rely on the existence of detectable similarity, and sequences without close relatives in the database may yield weak or no significant alignments, rendering classification difficult or impossible. This limitation is reflected in observations that, in some contexts, k-mer based tools might outperform reference similarity (alignment-based) tools, particularly when novel sequences are prevalent [5].​  

To potentially improve sensitivity for novel phages [2], several strategies can be employed. Adjusting alignment parameters, such as increasing the E-value threshold or reducing minimum query coverage, can help identify weaker, more distant homologies, although this increases the risk of false positives. A more robust strategy involves complementing standard sequence-to-sequence alignment with methods that detect similarity at the protein family or domain level. For example, using taxonomically informative profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) from databases like VOG (Viruses of Prokaryotes) can reveal conserved protein domains indicative of broader taxonomic groups, even when overall genome or protein sequence similarity is low [11]. Such approaches have proven effective in classifying viruses, including many previously unannotated sequences, often assigning them to higher taxonomic ranks like the _Caudovirales_ order [11]. Iterative search methods, such as PSI-BLAST, which build position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) from initial hits and use them in subsequent searches, can also improve sensitivity for more divergent homologs. Furthermore, integrating alignment results with other genomic features or utilizing protein-level analyses, such as clustering protein sequences with tools like BLASTP and building phylogenetic trees, can provide additional evidence for classification and reveal functional relationships that may not align strictly with traditional taxonomic boundaries [12,14]. ANI calculation, while requiring alignment, provides a metric for genomic relatedness useful for species-level delineation [5,10]. Providing raw alignment outputs also allows for downstream analyses, including network visualization, to explore relationships further [7].​  

# 3.2 Composition-Based (Alignment-Free) Methods  

Composition-based methods represent a class of alignment-free approaches for sequence analysis and classification, relying on the statistical properties of DNA or protein sequences rather than requiring direct sequence homology comparison [2]. The fundamental principle involves analyzing the frequency and distribution of fixed-length subsequences or other compositional features within a genome or sequence fragment [2]. Unlike alignment-based techniques that can be computationally intensive and struggle with highly divergent or fragmented sequences, alignment-free methods offer potential advantages in computational efficiency and are particularly well-suited for analyzing large-scale metagenomic datasets where sequences are often incomplete or represent novel, distantly related organisms [2].​  

A prominent compositional metric utilized in phage classification and viral identification is the frequency distribution of kmers, which are contiguous subsequences of length k [2]. By comparing the k-mer profiles of query sequences against known databases or using them as features for machine learning models, taxonomic assignments can be inferred [2]. This kmer approach has been applied in various contexts, including designing sequence "fingerprints" for identifying the source origins of metagenomic samples [28]. Several tools leverage k-mer analysis for metagenomic classification and virus detection. For instance, Kraken2 functions as a k-mer-based metagenomic classifier that queries input k-mers against a database to assign sequences to the lowest common ancestor taxonomic unit [5]. Machine learning has also been integrated with k-mer features, exemplified by VirFinder, which was an early tool using machine learning with $k$ -mer based features for virus identification [5]. More advanced methods, such as DeepVirFinder, build upon this by employing convolutional neural networks trained on extensive datasets, including environmental viral metagenomic data, to potentially improve performance [5]. Benchmarking studies evaluating k-mer-based metagenomic classifiers, including tools like CLARK, Kraken, LMAT, and NBC, have demonstrated their capability in classification tasks [16].​  

Beyond k-mer analysis, other simple compositional metrics are also employed. GC content, the percentage of guanine and cytosine bases in a sequence, is a basic compositional feature known to vary across different organisms and genomic regions [2]. Differences in GC content between viruses and their hosts can assist in identifying viral sequences within host backgrounds [2]. For example, the genome of the E.coliphage vB\_EcoM\_F2 was reported to have a GC content of $3 7 . 3 2 \%$ [9]. While GC content can provide initial clues, its effectiveness as a sole metric for distinguishing phages from hosts or classifying different phage groups is limited due to overlapping distributions and variability within taxonomic groups [2]. More complex compositional approaches, such as K-string composition based on the oligopeptide content of predicted proteomes, have also been explored, where genomic divergence is computed using metrics like the cosine function of the angle between composition vectors [10].​  

Evaluating the performance of composition-based methods reveals both strengths and limitations. Benchmarking studies indicate that integrating strategies like adding an abundance threshold can enhance the precision and F1 score of k-merbased tools, bringing their performance closer to that of marker-based methods [16]. However, the robustness of these methods can be affected by variations in sequencing depth and data quality. Notably, studies have observed that for many kmer-based methods, the incidence of false positives tends to increase with a higher number of reads, suggesting a positive correlation between sequencing depth and misclassified reads [16]. This highlights a challenge in applying these methods to deep sequencing data without careful parameter tuning or post-processing. Despite this, the inherent efficiency and capacity to handle divergent sequences make compositional approaches indispensable tools, particularly for initial screening and classification in metagenomic contexts [2].  

# 3.3 Gene Content and Phylogenetic Marker-Based Methods  

Gene content and phylogenetic marker-based methods constitute foundational approaches in phage classification, providing insights into their evolutionary history and relationships [4]. These methods leverage the genomic information of phages, either by examining the conservation of genes (core genome) or the entire gene repertoire (pan-genome), including flexible and unique genes [13]. The identification of a core genome, comprising genes common to a group of phages, helps define conserved functional and structural characteristics, thereby delineating phage groups. Conversely, the pan-genome, encompassing all genes found within a clade, including those present in only some or one genome [13], reflects the genetic diversity and potential functional variability within that group, influenced by gene gain and loss events. Analyzing the distribution of these genes provides a basis for understanding phage diversity and delineating phylogenetic relationships [7]. For instance, identifying orthologs, genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation, is crucial for core genome analysis, often performed using tools like OrthoMCL [10].  

The process of classification often relies on selected phylogenetic marker genes. These are typically core proteins, functional domains, or conserved sequences that are assumed to reflect the evolutionary history of the phages [4].

Common choices for marker genes include the terminase large subunit, particularly useful for analyzing closely related DNA phages, the capsid protein gene for assessing relationships among more distantly related DNA phages, the portal protein for tailed phages, and the RdRp functional domain for RNA phages [4]. The suitability of a marker gene depends on the taxonomic level being investigated. A single marker, while useful for resolving relationships at lower levels, is generally insufficient for accurate classification at higher ranks, such as the order level [4]. More robust methods often employ concatenated alignments of multiple single-copy protein-coding marker genes to construct phylogenetic trees capable of resolving species-level relationships [11]. The selection of reliable markers involves specific criteria such as universality (presence across the target taxonomic group), evenness in copy number, monophyly (genes from a group clustering together in a tree), and uniqueness (distinguishable from other gene families, often using HMMs) [25]. Automated protocols exist to systematically identify such markers from complete genome sequences based on these criteria [25]. Collections of orthologous genes from phages, like Phage Orthologous Groups (POGs), can serve as profiles or signatures for classification using homology search methods like BLASTP or HMMs [12].  

Significant challenges exist in accurately applying gene content and marker-based methods. Defining gene families, particularly distinguishing orthologs from paralogs or identifying evolutionarily related sequences across diverse phage lineages, is complex. This process often relies on sequence similarity clustering or more sophisticated methods [12]. The quality of gene annotation significantly impacts the accuracy of gene content analysis and subsequent marker selection. Inconsistent or erroneous annotations can lead to misidentification of homologous genes, affecting core/pan-genome definitions and phylogenetic signal [13,21]. Re-annotation using standardized pipelines can help homogenize datasets [13]. Tools also utilize protein annotations based on HMM hits from multiple databases to identify phages [5].  

Phylogenetic trees are typically constructed from alignments of selected marker gene sequences or concatenated alignments of multiple markers [9,11,21]. Methods like neighbor-joining [21] or more complex tree-building algorithms [25] are employed. These trees are then used to infer evolutionary relationships and classify phages [3,4]. Novel phage groups, such as crAssphages, Megaphages (Lak Phages), and Gubaphage, have been discovered and classified based on phylogenetic analysis using conserved proteins or specific markers like the large terminase gene, demonstrating their position as independent evolutionary branches or novel groups within existing families. Filtering genomes with insufficient marker gene representation is often necessary for robust tree construction [11]. Marker-based classification tools like MetaPhlAn and PhyloSift have been evaluated for precision in metagenomic contexts [16].​  

Despite their utility, methods relying solely on conserved genes have limitations. Phage genomes exhibit high rates of gene mosaicism and horizontal gene transfer (HGT), meaning large portions of their genomes can be acquired from unrelated sources, obscuring true vertical evolutionary signals. Relying only on a small set of conserved core genes may fail to capture the full evolutionary history and diversity, as much of the genome architecture and functional capacity is shaped by these dynamic processes. This inherent genomic fluidity, along with the insufficient resolution of single markers for higher taxonomic ranks [4], necessitates the integration of other classification approaches to complement marker-based phylogeny.​  

# 3.4 Whole-Genome Comparison Methods  

Whole-genome comparison methods offer high-resolution approaches for phage classification, moving beyond single-gene analysis to capture broader genomic relationships. Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) is a widely adopted metric for species delineation, providing a robust, quantitative measure [3,10,11]. Historically, ANI values have shown a strong correlation with DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) results, with an ANI value of $\geq 9 5 \%$ typically corresponding to the traditional $7 0 \%$ DDH threshold for species boundaries [10]. ANI is calculated from pairwise comparisons of all shared sequences between two genomes [10]. Common thresholds for defining species-level viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) often involve $\geq 9 5 \%$ ANI over at least $8 5 \%$ of the shorter genome's length [3,11]. Tools like VIRIDIC facilitate intergenomic distance calculations, which can be based on metrics related to ANI [13].  

Beyond simple sequence identity, analyzing gene content and organization, including synteny and gene order, is crucial for understanding genome evolution and identifying conserved genomic modules. Methods based on gene sharing profiles provide insights into the functional and structural relatedness of phage genomes, often used for clustering at genus or family levels [3,11]. For example, Average Amino Acid Identity (AAI) and gene sharing profiles have been utilized to cluster genomes into genus- and family-level groups [11]. Tools like vConTACT leverage whole-genome gene-sharing profiles in a network-based approach to cluster viral genomes [12]. Similarly, VirClust calculates intergenomic distances based on conserved protein clusters and identifies viral genome clusters [13]. Metrics like genomic fluidity quantify dissimilarity at the gene level using ortholog data, reflecting changes in gene content [10]. Genomic organization models (GOMs), as employed by tools like GRAViTy, further integrate information about gene order and content [12].​  

Whole-genome alignment tools are fundamental for capturing large-scale genome similarities and rearrangements. Tools such as MegaBLAST can be used for alignment across entire genomes to identify common regions and visualize the distribution of these regions, revealing structural features like fragmentations and complex inversions [21]. Algorithms like MAFFT, often utilized via servers such as NGPhylogeny, perform whole-genome alignments that can then be used to construct phylogenetic trees based on intergenomic distances [13]. These alignment-based methods provide a detailed view of genomic conservation and divergence. Comparative whole-proteome analysis using tools like ViPtree, which is tBLASTxbased, also contributes to understanding relationships by comparing protein content across genomes [13].  

The advantages of whole-genome comparison methods lie in their ability to provide high-resolution taxonomic insights and identify novel genomic features that single-gene methods might miss [10]. By considering the entire genome or its protein content and organization, these methods offer a more comprehensive view of evolutionary relationships and functional potential. However, applying these approaches to large and diverse phage genome datasets presents computational challenges. The high degree of mosaicism and frequent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) characteristic of phage genomes can complicate alignment and accurate gene sharing analysis, requiring robust algorithms and significant computational resources.​  

# 4. Structure-Based Phage Classification  

Structure-based phage classification offers a powerful alternative and complement to sequence-based methods, particularly valuable when sequence homology is low among distantly related phages [4].  

Traditional classification schemes have historically utilized basic virion morphology, categorizing phages based on the presence and structure of a tail (tailed, tailless, filamentous) and capsid shape [18].  

Modern structure-based methods delve deeper, focusing on the detailed architecture of the virion and its constituent proteins. Experimental techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) [4,13] are crucial for resolving highresolution structures of intact phage particles and their components.  

With the increasing availability of genomic data, computational methods for protein structure prediction have become indispensable, especially when experimental data is difficult or costly to obtain [4].  

Advanced machine learning-based tools like AlphaFold have revolutionized the field, enabling the prediction of 3D structures directly from amino acid sequences with high accuracy [4].  

Other computational platforms such as ColabFold, DI-TASSER, and Phyre2 also contribute significantly to generating 3D models of phage proteins, including structural and functional components like repressors [13].  

![](images/694725f89eff8d782ad2678b455f07bedd7af7712a1bc3d28fab3fbfca069e63.jpg)  

Classification through structural analysis primarily involves comparing key structural features. The folds of major capsid proteins (MCPs) are particularly informative, with characteristic patterns like the single jelly roll, double jelly roll, and Hk97 fold serving as robust markers for classification at higher taxonomic levels, reflecting ancient evolutionary divergences [4].  

Beyond the MCP, the structures of other proteins such as tail fibers and adhesins, involved in host recognition, or depolymerases, characterized by conserved motifs like parallel right-handed $\beta$ -helices [14,22], also provide valuable structural and functional insights that can inform classification, albeit often at lower taxonomic ranks.  

Computational tools like Phyre2 and PyMOL facilitate the comparison and superposition of predicted or experimentally determined structures to identify similarities and differences [13].  

Despite its potential, the wide-scale application of detailed structure-based classification faces challenges. Experimental structure determination remains resource-intensive and not always feasible for every phage isolate. While computational prediction is advancing rapidly, accuracy can vary, and interpreting structural similarities in an evolutionary context requires careful consideration. The development and accessibility of user-friendly computational tools for large-scale structural comparison and classification are ongoing efforts. Nevertheless, integrating structural data, particularly concerning major virion components, provides a powerful means to reinforce or refine phage taxonomy, offering a clearer view of their evolutionary landscape that is often obscured by sequence divergence alone [4].  

# 4.1 Protein Structure-Based Methods  

Protein structures, being generally more conserved across evolutionary timescales than their underlying amino acid sequences, offer valuable insights into deep phylogenetic relationships among phages. This conservation allows for the identification of homologous proteins and shared ancestral traits even when sequence similarity is low [4]. Consequently, analyzing protein structures has emerged as a crucial method for phage classification, particularly at higher taxonomic ranks.​  

A key focus in structure-based phage classification is the major capsid protein (MCP), a fundamental component of the virion structure involved in genome packaging and protection [4]. The three-dimensional structure of the MCP serves as a robust basis for classification [4]. Phage MCPs are primarily characterized by three distinct folding patterns: the single jelly roll, the double jelly roll, and the Hk97 fold [4]. These structural folds are considered major determinants for classifying phages from the domain level down to the class level, reflecting deep evolutionary divergence and relatedness [4].  

Computational methods play a vital role in determining and analyzing protein structures for classification. Traditionally, 3D structures were resolved through experimental techniques such as cryo-electron microscopy [4]. More recently, machine learning–based approaches like AlphaFold have revolutionized this process by enabling direct calculation of 3D structures without experimental data, significantly increasing throughput [4]. Beyond prediction, computational tools are essential for comparing structures and identifying conserved motifs. For instance, software like ColabFold, DI-TASSER, and Phyre2 can be used to generate 3D models of phage proteins, such as repressor proteins [13]. These models can then be analyzed and  

compared to known structures, such as the crystallographic structure of the $\lambda$ repressor (3BDN), using tools like Phyre2 and PyMOL for superposition analysis [13].  

While other phage proteins—such as encoded depolymerases, which exhibit conserved structural features like a homotrimeric structure and parallel right-handed $\beta$ -helices, and adhesins like Gp38, which are critical for specific host receptor recognition [14,22]—provide important functional insights, the MCP folds remain the most widely applied structural features for broad taxonomic classification.​  

Structure-based classifications often align with or complement sequence-based methods, particularly at higher taxonomic levels where sequence divergence can obscure relationships. The strong conservation of fundamental protein folds like the MCP provides a stable phylogenetic signal [4]. Discrepancies may arise when structural constraint differs from sequence evolution rates or when horizontal gene transfer affects specific genes. However, structural data, particularly concerning major structural components, has proven crucial in reinforcing proposed taxonomic divisions or suggesting new groupings that might be ambiguous from sequence data alone. Studies employing structural information, such as the detailed analysis of MCP folds [4] or the computational modeling of key proteins [13], highlight the utility of this approach in understanding the structural basis of phage diversity and refining their taxonomic organization.​  

# 5. Host-Interaction Based Phage Classification  

Phage classification can leverage the fundamental characteristic of host specificity, where a phage typically infects a limited range of bacterial strains or species [1,26]. Understanding this specificity provides crucial ecological insights into phagebacteria interactions within diverse environments [1,22].

The classification of phages based on their host interactions involves both empirical determination of infectivity and computational prediction of potential hosts.  

Experimental determination of phage host range provides direct evidence of lytic activity against specific bacterial strains under laboratory conditions [9,13]. Common techniques include spot tests and plaque assays, which visually demonstrate bacterial lysis [9,13]. These methods are invaluable for assessing parameters such as receptor recognition [13] and provide essential ground truth for validating predictive models. However, experimental methods are often labor-intensive, timeconsuming, and restricted by the requirement for bacterial culturability [1,33]. Furthermore, practical considerations such as standardization of protocols are critical for ensuring the reproducibility and comparability of results across studies [33].  

Complementary to experimental approaches are computational methods for predicting phage hosts, which are particularly useful for analyzing large-scale genomic and metagenomic datasets where experimental testing is impractical [1]. These methods infer potential interactions by analyzing sequence-based features [22]. Principles behind these predictions include matching CRISPR spacers in bacterial genomes to sequences in phage genomes, indicating past infection events [11,27]. Other sequence-based approaches leverage genomic similarity, such as whole-genome alignments, and integrated models that combine multiple protein and DNA sequence features, including protein organization, sequence similarity, CRISPR signals, and k-mer frequencies, formulated as a link prediction problem in a knowledge graph [7,11]. While computational tools offer scalability, their accuracy is influenced by the completeness of reference databases and the inherent complexity of phage-host interactions [1]. Evaluating the accuracy and scalability of these tools is essential for their effective application in phage classification.  

Despite the utility of host range data, using it as a sole classification criterion presents challenges. The observed host range can be influenced by variations in experimental conditions [33]. Biological factors such as bacterial defense mechanisms, including surface receptor modifications and CRISPR-Cas systems, can restrict phage infection and affect observed specificity [1,27]. The genetic basis of host specificity is complex, involving multiple phage and host factors, and the distinction between lytic and temperate lifestyles (lysogeny) further complicates simple host range definitions [1,26]. Consequently, host range alone may not fully capture the taxonomic relationships or evolutionary history of phages. Integrating host-interaction data, derived from both experimental assays and computational predictions, with other classification criteria such as genomic relatedness, significantly enhances the robustness of phage classification schemes and provides valuable insights for practical applications, notably in phage therapy, where precise host targeting is paramount [33].​  

# 5.1 Experimental Determination  

Experimental determination of phage host range involves direct observation of phage–bacteria interactions, providing empirical evidence of infectivity. These methods are foundational for understanding the lytic capabilities of phages against specific bacterial strains or species. One standard workflow is the spot test, where serial dilutions of phage lysate are spotted onto bacterial lawns grown on agar plates [9,13]. Lysis at the spot after incubation, typically overnight, indicates a successful infection [9]. This method is often used to assess aspects like outer membrane receptor recognition [13].​  

Another widely used method is the plaque assay, which typically begins with isolating and culturing host bacteria, proliferating phages in the presence of sensitive strains in liquid media, and then mixing the resulting supernatant (containing phages) with sensitive bacteria in soft agar [18]. This mixture is then spread over a solid agar medium [18]. Phage activity leads to bacterial lysis on the plate surface, forming clear zones known as plaques [18]. Phage purification is often performed by serially picking single plaques, diluting them, and re-plating until uniform plaque morphology is observed [18]. Variations exist, such as observing turbid zones or halos around plaques in soft agar overlays of capsulated hosts, which can indicate the activity of phage-encoded depolymerases targeting capsules [14]. Beyond standard lysis assays, host range or resistance can also be experimentally assessed by co-culturing bacterial species in the presence of phages and observing competitive dynamics, which can reveal mechanisms like CRISPR-mediated resistance evolution [27].  

The primary advantage of experimental methods is that they provide direct evidence of a functional interaction between a phage and a host under defined conditions. Observing lysis or plaque formation unequivocally demonstrates that a phage can infect and replicate within a specific bacterium. However, these methods have significant limitations. They are typically labor-intensive and time-consuming, particularly when testing a large panel of phages against a wide range of potential hosts. A major constraint is the requirement for the host bacterium to be culturable under laboratory conditions, which excludes a vast proportion of environmental bacteria. Furthermore, bacterial defense mechanisms, such as modifications to cell surface receptors or the secretion of inhibitory substances like capsules, can prevent phage adsorption and infection, leading to a false negative result in host range testing even if the phage could theoretically interact with the host in the absence of such defenses [1].​  

The comparability of experimental host range data across studies is highly dependent on the standardization of protocols. Variations in factors such as media composition, incubation temperature, bacterial growth phase, and phage concentration can significantly influence the observed outcome. Establishing and adhering to standardized protocols are crucial for ensuring that results are reproducible and comparable, facilitating meaningful meta-analyses and building comprehensive host range databases.​  

Although experimental host range determination is often limited in scale due to the inherent challenges, the data generated is invaluable. It provides crucial ground truth for validating computationally predicted phage–host interactions, allowing researchers to assess the accuracy and reliability of in silico tools. Moreover, experimental data directly informs the practical application of phages, particularly in areas like phage therapy, where identifying phages with specific lytic activity against target pathogens is paramount.  

# 5.2 Computational Prediction  

Computational prediction of phage hosts represents a crucial advancement in phage classification, particularly valuable for analyzing large genomic or metagenomic datasets where experimental determination of host specificity is often infeasible [1].​  

This computational approach allows for the broad classification and characterization of phages identified through sequencing, providing insights into their potential ecological roles and interactions within complex microbial commun  

Various computational methods have been developed, leveraging different types of evidence derived from sequence data. One approach involves analyzing genomic data to infer phage-host relationships [22]. Specific implementations utilize the evolutionary history reflected in CRISPR-Cas systems. For instance, studies have predicted cellular hosts by extracting CRISPR spacers from host genomes within large databases, such as the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) database, and matching them to viral genomes [11]. The presence of matching spacers provides evidence of historical phage infection, indicating a potential host.​  

Beyond CRISPR analysis, other methods rely on genomic similarities and features. Whole-genome alignment between viruses and potential hosts is employed to identify connections based on near-exact genomic matches, often defined by stringent criteria such $a s \geq 9 6 \%$ identity over a segment of $\geq 1$ kilobase (kb) [11]. Such high sequence similarity can suggest recent shared history or even integration events. Furthermore, approaches like CHERRY integrate multiple sequence-based features to predict virus-prokaryote interactions, suggesting the utility of a diverse array of genomic signatures beyond simple sequence identity or CRISPR matches [7]. Sequence analysis is also applied to predict specific functional elements crucial for infection and integration, such as phage attachment sites and integrase types [13].​  

While computational methods offer unprecedented throughput, their accuracy is subject to limitations. The completeness and quality of reference databases significantly influence prediction reliability; novel phages or hosts not represented in databases are challenging to classify. Moreover, the complexity of phage-host interactions, which can involve multiple mechanisms beyond those captured by current computational models, introduces potential for false positives or negatives. Despite these challenges, computational predictions serve as powerful tools to guide experimental efforts, such as validating predicted interactions through techniques like DNA sequencing [13]. By providing testable hypotheses derived from large datasets, computational methods accelerate our understanding of phage ecology, host specificity, and the dynamics of phage–bacteria interactions in diverse environments.​  

# 6. Machine Learning Approaches in Phage Classification  

Machine learning (ML) represents a significant paradigm shift in the computational analysis and classification of phages, offering powerful capabilities to discern complex patterns within vast biological datasets that often elude traditional approaches [8].  

![](images/5a6b1cb8fd9a2b5de7d3e33a6593d76248223c975e2fc5ce9ff8cf1ca368114e.jpg)  

![](images/e50ea85127974d795361c7fe121650f63c19af56fd70a75c3268fe81fda54166.jpg)  

The application of ML spans diverse data types, including genomic sequences, protein information, and potentially host interaction data, enabling automated identification, characterization, and taxonomic assignment of phage elements [34].  

The landscape of ML algorithms applied in phage classification is varied, encompassing several key categories. Supervised learning methods, which rely on pre-labeled datasets of known phages or phage components, are widely used for classification tasks such as assigning phages to specific families or genera, and also for regression tasks predicting continuous properties [17]. Examples include ensemble classifiers [28], gradient boosting models like LightGBM [15], and Artificial Neural Networks [12]. In contrast, unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering algorithms, are invaluable for exploring the intrinsic structure of phage populations and identifying potentially novel groups in the absence of prior labels [17]. Methods like hierarchical clustering, K-means, Gaussian mixture models [30], and Self-Organizing Maps [21] fall into this category.  

A critical step in applying ML to phage data is feature engineering, which involves transforming raw biological information into informative features suitable for model input [15]. This process extracts relevant biological characteristics, ranging from simple sequence composition features like k-mer frequencies [7,11] to more complex protein-centric features, including the presence of specific protein families [11], protein sequence embeddings like UniRep [15] and pLM features [19], and even structural information [4]. Feature selection is subsequently employed to identify the most discriminative features, reducing dimensionality and improving model performance and interpretability [15].​  

Model training and evaluation are rigorous processes essential for developing reliable classification tools [30]. This involves careful data partitioning into training, validation, and testing sets to prevent overfitting and ensure generalizability, often utilizing techniques like cross-validation [15,30]. Model performance is quantified using a suite of evaluation metrics appropriate for the task. For classification, key metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUROC [15,17,30,34]. For clustering tasks, metrics like Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI), Silhouette Index (SI), and Davies–Bouldin Index (DBI) are used to assess the quality of cluster assignments [17]. Regression tasks employ metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) [17]. The selection and interpretation of these metrics are crucial for understanding the strengths and limitations of different models, particularly in the context of potentially imbalanced datasets [17].  

Advanced techniques, particularly deep learning architectures, have demonstrated significant potential in capturing intricate patterns in phage genomic data directly, often bypassing the need for explicit feature engineering [8]. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are adept at learning sequence motifs and patterns [2,20], utilized in tools like DeepVirFinder and PPR-Meta [5]. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are applied to leverage relational information, such as gene-sharing networks, enhancing classification in tools like PhaGCN [4,7]. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically LSTM networks, are suitable for processing sequential genomic data, as seen in Seeker [5]. Furthermore, Transformer models and genomic language models are emerging, capable of learning contextual representations and relationships within sequences [7,19]. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve overall robustness and performance [28]. Comparing different algorithms and feature sets involves considering factors such as computational demands, the interpretability of model predictions, and the availability of labeled training data [5,17]. Despite the progress, challenges remain, including the need for high-quality training data for supervised approaches, the interpretability of complex deep learning models, and the development of metrics that accurately reflect performance on highly diverse and potentially imbalanced phage datasets. These aspects collectively define the current state and future trajectory of machine learning applications in advancing phage classification.  

# 6.1 Algorithms and Techniques  

Machine learning algorithms form the foundation of many modern phage classification tools, employing diverse strategies to analyze genomic and proteomic data. These approaches can be broadly categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning methods.  

Supervised learning algorithms are trained using pre-labelled datasets, where each data point is assigned a known class or value [17]. In the context of phage classification, this typically involves training models on sequences or features derived from phages with known taxonomic assignments to predict the classification of new sequences [2]. These methods are commonly applied for classification tasks, predicting discrete outcomes like species or family [17], or regression tasks, predicting continuous variables such as activity levels or genomic properties [17,20]. Examples of supervised techniques include ensemble classifiers, which combine multiple standard algorithms to enhance performance [28]. Gradient Boosting Decision Tree methods like LightGBM are also utilized, optimizing performance through iterative learning and techniques such as gradient one-side sampling and exclusive feature bundling [15]. Other supervised methods include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) used for classification [12] and phylogenetic approaches such as concatenated protein phylogeny for specific phage groups [12]. While powerful for predicting known categories, a primary challenge for supervised learning is the requirement for high-quality, comprehensively labeled training data, which can be scarce for novel or less-studied phage groups. Additionally, these models are susceptible to overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data, and may struggle with imbalanced datasets where some classes are underrepresented [17].  

Unsupervised learning methods, in contrast, operate without pre-assigned labels, seeking to discover hidden patterns or structures within the data [17]. Clustering is a prominent unsupervised technique used to group data points into subgroups based on similarity, with or without prior labels [17]. This is particularly valuable in phage research for identifying potentially novel phage groups or exploring the inherent structure of diverse phage populations [17]. Common clustering algorithms include hierarchical clustering, K-means, and Gaussian mixture models [30]. The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is another unsupervised technique used for clustering analysis based on sequence similarity [21]. Unsupervised methods excel in data exploration and discovery but can be sensitive to noise in the data [17]. While GCN models can be applied to help explain clustering classifications, the analysis results are often limited to higher taxonomic levels such as family and genus [4]. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP, although not strictly clustering, are also unsupervised methods that can aid in visualizing and understanding the relationships within phage datasets [34].​  

Deep learning represents a powerful subset of machine learning capable of automatically learning complex hierarchical features directly from raw data, circumventing the need for manual feature engineering [8]. These methods often require significant computational resources and expertise, particularly when applied to complex biological data like protein science or utilizing models such as probabilistic graphical models [31]. Specific deep learning architectures are highly relevant to phage analysis:​  

• Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for their ability to identify spatial hierarchies of features, making them well-suited for analyzing sequence data and detecting characteristic genomic patterns or sequence motifs [2,5,20]. Tools like DeepVirFinder and PPR-Meta employ CNNs for identifying phage sequences [2,5]. CNNs are also integrated into models like PhaGCN for taxa classification [7] and used in complex setups like two-step hurdle models for both classification and regression tasks by capturing sequence motifs and mismatch patterns [20].​ • Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are designed to operate on graph-structured data, which is useful for modeling relationships within genomic networks or among genes. PhaGCN utilizes GCNs in conjunction with CNNs for taxa classification [7]. GCNs can also provide insights into clustering results, often at the family and genus levels [4]. • Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are capable of processing sequential data and capturing dependencies across sequences, with LSTM being used in tools like Seeker for phage identification [5].​  

• Transformer models, leveraging self-attention mechanisms, have shown significant promise in learning complex associations. PhaMer employs a Transformer to learn protein organization and associations [7]. Furthermore, Transformer-based genomic language models (gLMs) can be trained on vast amounts of metagenomic sequence data to represent genomic sequences and predict genes, outperforming baseline models like LSTMs and providing representations (e.g., using pLM features) that are critical for performance [19]. The attention mechanisms within these models can reveal biological insights, such as identifying protein co-regulation signals like operons [19].​  

• Other graph-based models like graph encoder-decoders are also applied, as seen in tools like CHERRY [7].  

In addition to sequence-based methods, phylogenetic models, such as those using molecular clock and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling like BEAST, are employed to build relationship models based on evolutionary factors like time, region, and SNPs [4], providing an alternative perspective on classification through evolutionary history. These diverse algorithmic and technical approaches highlight the multi-faceted nature of computational phage classification, integrating statistical models, traditional machine learning, and advanced deep learning architectures to tackle the challenges posed by the complexity and diversity of phage genomes.​  

# 6.2 Feature Engineering  

Feature engineering is a critical step that significantly influences the performance of machine learning models applied to phage classification and analysis [30]. It involves transforming raw genomic sequence data into a set of informative features that capture relevant biological characteristics suitable for algorithmic processing. Various types of features can be derived from phage genomic sequences, each providing distinct biological insights.​  

Sequence-based features are fundamental, capturing the intrinsic composition of the genetic material. A common approach is the use of k-mer frequency information, which quantifies the occurrences of short nucleotide subsequences of length $k$ [7,30]. K-mers can reflect species-specific genomic signatures and compositional biases. Alternatively, models can directly utilize raw nucleotide sequences, typically represented via one-hot encoding, allowing deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically identify informative sequence motifs and patterns relevant to classification or function, such as those related to Cas13a activity or mismatch-sensitive regions [5,20]. Methods like PPRMeta and Seeker exemplify this by using neural networks to extract features directly from sequences without relying on preselected features like k-mers or genes [5].​  

Protein-centric features are also highly valuable due to proteins being the functional units encoded by phages. These include the presence or absence of specific viral protein families, often identified using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) against databases like IMG/VR [11]. Complementarily, the absence of microbial protein families (e.g., identified via Pfam-A HMMs) can serve as a distinguishing viral signature [11]. Protein composition and position information can be used, for instance, by constructing a protein cluster vocabulary for Transformer models like in PhaMer [7]. Protein sequence information can also be captured at a higher level through embeddings. The UniRep feature transforms whole protein peptide sequences into numeric vectors, reflecting physicochemical properties grouped by amino acid residue clusters (e.g., hydrophobic, charged, polar), suitable for algorithms like LightGBM [15]. More advanced approaches utilize protein Language Model (pLM) embeddings, such as 1280-feature vectors from ESM2, which provide contextualized representations capturing functional relationships and even potentially reflecting biological processes like horizontal transfer frequencies [19]. The concept of combinatorial entropy has also been explored to analyze protein function, which can be seen as a form of feature engineering to reveal determinants of protein activity [29].  

Other genomic features include gene content, organization information (e.g., multiple adjacent genes on the same strand [11]), and gene orientation (forward or backward) [19]. Structural elements like CRISPR signals can also be integrated [7]. Furthermore, comparative features like sequence similarity between phages and prokaryotes are informative for distinguishing viral from host sequences [7]. Some approaches, like CHERRY, integrate various features—including protein organization, sequence similarity, CRISPR signals, and k-mer frequency—into a knowledge graph structure to leverage relationships between different data types [7]. While primarily applied to microbial communities, methods like Hierarchical Feature Engineering (HFE) that use correlation and taxonomic information to identify informative taxa and reduce feature dimensionality could potentially be adapted or inspire analogous approaches for phage classification in complex samples [28]. Conceptually, integrating genomic features with functional impact data, such as metabolic interactions with host bacteria, could lead to more comprehensive classification systems [34].  

Selecting the most informative subset of features is crucial to reduce dimensionality, mitigate noise, and improve model generalization, especially given the high dimensionality of genomic data [15,28]. This can involve methods ranging from statistical tests and correlation analysis (as seen in HFE [28]) to model-based selection techniques or incorporating biological knowledge. However, a key challenge lies in selecting features that are not only statistically predictive but also biologically interpretable. Features like k-mer frequencies or specific protein family presence offer relatively clear biological meaning, while complex features derived from deep embeddings or learned directly by neural networks, although potentially highly predictive, can be more challenging to interpret in terms of specific biological mechanisms [19,20]. The choice of features also depends on the downstream machine learning algorithm, with some algorithms better suited for dense numerical vectors (e.g., LightGBM [15]) and others for sequential data (e.g., CNNs, Transformers [7,20]). Combining diverse feature types in integrated frameworks or knowledge graphs represents an effort to leverage the strengths of multiple data sources [7,11].  

# 6.3 Model Training and Evaluation Metrics  

Rigorous model training and evaluation are fundamental steps in the development of reliable machine learning tools for phage classification. The process typically involves several stages, including study design, data collection, data preparation, model training, model evaluation, and subsequent performance improvement [30]. A critical aspect of this workflow is the division of the dataset into distinct subsets for training, validation, and testing. This partitioning is essential to prevent overfitting, where a model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize to unseen data, thereby ensuring the model's performance is accurately assessed on independent data [30]. Techniques such as internal validation, including kfold cross-validation, and external validation using entirely separate cohorts are commonly employed to assess generalizability [30].​  

Evaluating the performance of machine learning models, particularly for classification tasks like identifying phage sequences or proteins, requires the application of appropriate metrics. These metrics quantify different aspects of a model's predictive capability and are crucial for understanding its strengths and weaknesses [17].  

Common classification metrics include accuracy, precision, recall (also known as sensitivity), F1-score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) [15,17,19,30,34]. Other metrics encountered in phage-related or genomics studies include specificity [15], Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) [15], Area Under the Precision-Recall curve (auPR) [20], true-positive rate (TPR) and false-positive rate (FPR) [11], Cohen's Kappa statistic, multiclass geometric mean (Gmean), and multiclass AUC (MAUC) for multi-class scenarios [28].  

Accuracy measures the overall proportion of correctly classified instances among the total number of instances [17]. It is calculated as:  

$$
A c c u r a c y = { \frac { \mathrm { n u m b e r ~ o f ~ c o r r e c t ~ c l a s s i f i c a t i o n s } } { \mathrm { t o t a l ~ n u m b e r ~ o f ~ c l a s s i f i c a t i o n s } } } \times 1 0 0 \
$$  

While intuitive, accuracy can be misleading, particularly when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class significantly outnumbers others [17]. In such cases, a high accuracy might simply reflect the model's ability to correctly classify the majority class, while performing poorly on the minority class.  

Precision and recall provide a more nuanced view, especially in imbalanced scenarios or when different types of errors have varying costs. These metrics are derived from the confusion matrix, which tabulates true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN) [17]. Precision quantifies the proportion of true positives among all instances predicted as positive:  

$$
P r e c i s i o n = \frac { T P } { T P + F P }
$$  

It is crucial when minimizing false positives is the priority, such as avoiding misclassifying non-phage sequences as phages. Recall (or sensitivity) measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances:  

$$
R e c a l l = \frac { T P } { T P + F N }
$$  

It is important when minimizing false negatives is critical, such as ensuring the detection of as many true phages as possible [17]. A high recall is desirable when missing a positive instance is costly. The relative importance of precision and recall varies depending on the specific problem and the consequences of each type of error [17]. For example, some studies  

prioritize precision in identifying virus-prokaryotic interactions [7], while others evaluate performance based on a balance of TPR and FPR [11].  

The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:  

$$
F 1 = 2 \times \frac { P \times R } { P + R }
$$  

where $\left\backslash ( \mathsf { P } \backslash ) \right.$ is precision and $\left\backslash \left( \mathsf { R } \right\backslash \right)$ is recall [17]. It provides a single metric that balances both concerns and is particularly useful when there is an uneven class distribution [17]. Improvements in F1-score are often reported to highlight a tool's effectiveness, especially on complex data like real metagenomes [7]. Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) is another metric that produces a high score only if the model performs well in all four categories of the confusion matrix (TP, TN, FP, FN), making it generally considered a balanced measure even for imbalanced datasets [15].​  

The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) summarizes classifier performance across all possible decision thresholds [17]. It plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate. A related metric, the Area Under the Precision-Recall curve (auPR), is often preferred for imbalanced datasets as it provides a more informative picture of performance on the minority class [20]. However, AUROC assumes equal desirability of minimizing false positives and false negatives and can be susceptible to biases from imbalanced or small datasets [17].​  

For unsupervised learning tasks, such as clustering phage sequences into taxonomic or functional groups, different metrics are required to evaluate the quality of the assignments. The choice of clustering metric depends on whether "ground truth" labels are available for the data [17]. Extrinsic measures, such as the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) or Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI), are used when known categories exist to compare the generated clusters against [17]. ARI measures the similarity between two clusterings, accounting for chance agreement, and ranges from -1 (complete disagreement) to 1 (perfect agreement) [17]:​  

$$
A R I = { \frac { R I - E } { 1 - E } }
$$  

where $\mathsf { \backslash } ( \mathsf { R I } \backslash )$ is the Rand Index and $\left\backslash ( \mathsf { E } \backslash ) \right.$ is the expected Rand Index under random partitioning [17]. AMI quantifies the mutual information shared between two clusterings, adjusted for chance [17]. Both ARI and AMI can be influenced by cluster size or purity [17].​  

When ground truth labels are unavailable, intrinsic measures are employed. These metrics evaluate cluster quality based solely on the data and the resulting clusters, typically by assessing intra-cluster similarity compared to inter-cluster similarity [17]. Examples include the Silhouette Index (SI) and the Davies–Bouldin Index (DBI) [17]. SI measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, with values ranging from -1 to 1, where higher scores indicate better-defined clusters [17]:​  

$$
S I = \frac { 1 } { N } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } s ( i )
$$  

where $\mathsf { \backslash } ( \mathsf { s } ( \mathsf { i } ) \mathsf { \backslash } )$ is the silhouette coefficient for sample \(i\) [17]. DBI calculates the average similarity ratio of each cluster with its most similar cluster; lower DBI values indicate better separation and compactness of clusters [17]:  

$$
D B I = \frac { 1 } { N } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } \operatorname* { m a x } _ { j } R _ { i j }
$$  

where \(R_{ij}\) is the similarity measure between clusters \(i\) and $\backslash ( \mathfrak { j } \backslash )$ . Intrinsic metrics like SI have limitations, such as assuming Gaussian clusters and not detecting biases unrelated to the trait of interest [17].  

Understanding these diverse performance metrics is paramount for critically assessing and interpreting the results of machine learning tools for phage classification [17]. Researchers must select metrics appropriate for the specific problem, dataset characteristics (e.g., balance), and the relative costs of different error types to gain a comprehensive and reliable understanding of a model's true performance. Metrics like Shannon and Simpson alpha diversity indices, and Bray–Curtis dissimilarity for beta diversity, are also used to assess the impact of tool predictions on downstream biological analyses, such as diversity estimation [5]. Regression metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Rsquared $( \backslash ( \mathsf { R } ^ { \land } 2 \backslash ) )$ or Adjusted $\left\backslash \left( \mathsf { R } ^ { \wedge } 2 \right\backslash \right)$ are relevant for tasks predicting continuous values, although less common than classification metrics in the core task of phage classification itself [17,19,20]. The informed use and interpretation of these metrics underpin the confidence in the performance and utility of phage classification tools.​  

# 7. Integrated and Polyphasic Classification Approaches  

The limitations inherent in relying on single methodologies for phage classification have driven the development of integrated and polyphasic approaches [33]. These strategies aim to enhance the accuracy, robustness, and comprehensive understanding of phage taxonomy by leveraging complementary information derived from diverse data sources [33]. By combining different types of data and analytical techniques, researchers can overcome the shortcomings of individual methods, which may only capture specific facets of phage biology or evolutionary history [33].  

![](images/40bb07be211134fff9f7acd555ad997e2a32171cf65ace8b185abefd60e0f565.jpg)  

Various strategies exist for integrating disparate data types in phage classification. One approach involves the integration of different feature types, such as protein and DNA sequence features, which can be combined into structures like knowledge graphs to improve predictions for downstream tasks, such as host prediction [7]. Similarly, genomic context information can be integrated with protein sequence data, often represented as protein language model embeddings, to enhance gene function prediction and the analysis of protein co-regulation [19]. Beyond sequence data, studies have demonstrated the value of integrating genomic data with proteomic data (e.g., from mass spectrometry of virion structural proteins) and experimental data (e.g., phage infection assays) for comprehensive characterization and classification [13].  

Another common strategy is the integration of results from multiple tools or analytical pipelines, often referred to as late integration or ensemble methods. Viral detection pipelines frequently combine evidence from diverse sources, such as viral protein families, the absence of microbial protein families, viral nucleotide signatures (e.g., VirFinder), and genomic features like multiple adjacent genes on the same strand [11]. Benchmarking studies highlight the advantages of combining tools with different underlying classification strategies (e.g., k-mer-based, alignment-based, marker gene-based) to capitalize on their respective strengths [16]. Ensemble classifiers, such as “majority vote” approaches, have been shown to yield improved F1 scores, demonstrating enhanced recall with limited loss in precision at taxonomic levels like the genus [16]. Examples include workflows that combine tools like Kraken2 with VirSorter2 and DeepVirFinder for detecting novel phages [5].​  

Integrated approaches also extend to combining different analytical methodologies. For instance, the delineation of bacterial species (by analogy relevant to phage host classification) can benefit from combining core genome phylogenetic analysis with metrics like Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), integrating a theoretically rigorous method with a pragmatic one [10]. In phage classification, recent studies have successfully combined phylogenetic relationships with gene-sharing networks, particularly for applications in gut phage classification and the discovery of new phages [3]. This integrated analysis of large-scale human gut metagenomes has led to the identification of thousands of relatively complete phage genomes and the proposal of novel phage families [3]. Furthermore, integrating linear techniques with non-linear dimensionality reduction and differential network analysis, alongside the construction of multi-layer networks that incorporate diverse data types like genomic information, host range, and environmental context, is advocated for a more holistic understanding of microbial communities, applicable to phage-centric studies [34].  

Frameworks proposed by bodies like the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) inherently adopt a multilevel, integrated approach, recommending different evolutionary classification methods based on taxonomic rank [4]. This involves utilizing motif or fold region analysis at higher levels (domain to class), core gene analysis at intermediate levels (subclass to family), amino acid sequence similarity for lower levels (order to genus), and nucleic acid sequence similarity for the lowest levels (subfamily to species) [4]. Specialized integrated systems have also been developed, such as GInforBIO, which combines data management with various sequence analysis programs, allowing seamless data transfer between tools for integrated workflows like phylogenetic analysis of sequence clusters [21]. Another example, the ADAPT system, integrates deep learning models with combinatorial optimization for designing viral diagnostics, demonstrating how combining diverse computational approaches can yield systems that are both sensitive and specific across taxonomic levels [20].  

Integrated approaches offer substantial advantages, including improved prediction accuracy, enhanced robustness against noise or limitations of single data types, and a more holistic biological and taxonomic understanding. However, these approaches also present challenges. Integrating disparate data types necessitates careful consideration of data formats, normalization, and potential biases. Weighting different sources of evidence appropriately can be complex, requiring sophisticated algorithms or expert knowledge. Developing standardized frameworks for truly polyphasic classification that seamlessly incorporate genotypic, phenotypic, ecological, and potentially other data types remains an ongoing area of research and development. Despite these challenges, the trajectory of phage classification clearly points towards increasingly integrated and polyphasic methodologies as the most promising path for accurately and comprehensively classifying the vast diversity of phages.​  

# 8. Computational Tools, Software, and Databases  

The computational analysis of phage genomes and metagenomic sequences is fundamental to advancing phage classification and characterization. This field relies on a diverse ecosystem of computational tools, software, and databases, each contributing specific capabilities to the workflow.  

![](images/b88eb9591931959f5d04a5ea122db620e3f5922867844cd9c2dfbbd53fa56c59.jpg)  

These resources can be broadly categorized based on their accessibility and scope, ranging from user-friendly web servers to flexible standalone software and comprehensive integrated platforms [13].  

Web servers offer significant advantages in terms of accessibility and ease of use, requiring no local installation and often providing intuitive graphical interfaces [7,20]. This makes them particularly valuable for researchers without extensive bioinformatics backgrounds or access to powerful computing infrastructure. An exemplary web-based platform is PhaBOX, which provides an integrated suite of modules for essential phage analysis tasks, including identification (PhaMer), lifestyle prediction (PhaTYP), taxonomy classification (PhaGCN), and host prediction (CHERRY), all accessible via a web interface and accepting assembled contigs in FASTA format [7]. Other web-based tools serve specific purposes, such as ADAPT for designing viral diagnostics based on public genome data [20].  

In contrast, standalone software necessitates local installation, often operating via command-line interfaces. While this might require more technical expertise, it grants greater control over analytical parameters, facilitates the processing of large datasets, and enables seamless integration into custom bioinformatics pipelines [6]. Examples include tools for specific tasks like PhageGT, which is designed for analyzing dsDNA phage genome termini from High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) reads, a critical structural feature for classification and replication understanding [6]. More general microbial analysis systems like G-InforBIO, while not solely phage-centric, integrate various tools for genome management, annotation, and comparative genomics, supporting downstream phage analysis workflows [21].​  

A key trend is the development of integrated platforms that combine multiple analytical functionalities within a single environment. These platforms, whether web-based like PhaBOX [7] or standalone systems like G-InforBIO [21], streamline the analytical process from sequence identification to downstream characterization (e.g., lifestyle, host, annotation), reducing the need for data transfer between disparate tools [2].​  

Functionalities offered by these computational resources span the entire phage analysis pipeline. Core functions include the identification and prediction of viral sequences from genomic or metagenomic data, employing various methodologies such as sequence alignment (e.g., MetaPhinder, portions of geNomad) [2], k-mer composition (e.g., VirFinder) [18], protein family analysis (e.g., VIBRANT, VPF-Class) [2,12], marker gene identification (e.g., PhiSpy) [18], and increasingly, machine learning and deep learning models (e.g., geNomad, DeepVirFinder, VirSorter2, PPR-Meta, PhaMer, VirFinder, MARVEL) [2,5,11,18]. Tools like VirSorter2 can differentiate between lytic phages and prophages and assign confidence levels to predictions [3]. Beyond identification, tools provide capabilities for taxonomic classification (e.g., PhaGCN, CAT, MMseqs2), lifestyle prediction (e.g., PhaTYP), host prediction (e.g., CHERRY, VPF-Class), genome annotation (e.g., VIBRANT, PHANOTATE, geNomad), and phylogenetic analysis (e.g., MEGA 7.0, FastTree, PhyML $. + 5 M \leq$ S) [2,7,9,10,12,13]. The usability and documentation of these tools are crucial for both expert and non-expert users to effectively utilize their functionalities and interpret their outputs, which often include detailed reports, scores, and visualizations (e.g., geNomad's TSV files, PhaBOX's CSV and visualizations, CGView's genome maps) [2,7,9,21].​  

Databases form the cornerstone of many phage classification approaches, particularly those relying on sequence homology and reference-based methods [4]. Key databases include general sequence repositories such as NCBI GenBank and RefSeq Viral Database, widely used for sequence searches, functional annotation, and genome retrieval [2,9,11,13]. DDBJ is another important source for genome data [21]. Specialized databases focusing on protein families and functional annotation are equally vital, including IMG/VR, Pfam-A, VOGDB (pVOG), and KEGG, which aid in annotation and distinguishing viral sequences based on protein content [2,5,11]. Environment-specific databases like the Gut Virome Database (GVD) and Gut Phage Database (GPD) provide valuable context for studying phages in particular niches [3].​  

Despite the growing volume of data in public repositories, a significant challenge remains the incomplete representation of the vast phage diversity within current databases [4,16]. This limitation directly impacts the performance and sensitivity of reference-based classification tools, often necessitating the use of de novo methods and contributing to the emergence of novel, unclassified viral sequences [3,16]. Addressing this requires continuous efforts in novel phage discovery through culturomics, meta-viromics, and prophage induction, coupled with the consistent deposition of new data into public repositories [4]. Given the rapid influx of new phage data, the maintenance and frequent updating of both computational tools and their associated databases are paramount to ensure their continued accuracy, relevance, and utility in classifying and characterizing the ever-expanding virosphere [29].  

# 8.1 Overview of Tools and Platforms (Including Web Servers)  

The field of phage classification and analysis relies heavily on a diverse array of computational tools and platforms, designed to process genomic and metagenomic data [13]. These resources vary significantly in their accessibility, installation requirements, flexibility, and the specific analytical capabilities they offer. Broadly, computational tools for phage classification can be categorized into web servers and standalone software, each presenting distinct advantages and trade-offs for researchers.  

Web servers provide ease of access, requiring no local installation and often featuring user-friendly graphical interfaces. This makes them particularly suitable for researchers without extensive bioinformatics expertise or access to high-performance computing resources. An example of a web-based platform is PhaBOX, which offers an integrated suite of tools for phage identification, lifestyle prediction, taxonomy classification, and host prediction, accepting assembled sequence contigs in FASTA format and providing results in CSV format [7]. Another web server, ADAPT, focuses on the specific task of designing viral assays and incorporates performance optimizations like memoization to decrease runtime significantly [20].  

Conversely, standalone software typically requires local installation but offers greater flexibility, more granular control over parameters, and the potential for higher performance when handling large datasets or complex custom analyses. These tools often operate via the command line, which facilitates their integration into automated pipelines and workflows [6]. However, the prevalence of command-line tools, particularly under Linux systems, has created gaps in accessibility, such as the previously limited availability of user-friendly tools for specific tasks like detecting dsDNA phage genome termini on the Windows operating system, a gap addressed by the development of software like PhageGT [6]. Standalone software can also take the form of integrated packages, such as G-InforBIO, a Java-based system for microbial genome data management and analysis that incorporates various tools and viewers for tasks like data retrieval, annotation editing, and comparative genomics [21].​  

The common functionalities offered by these tools span the entire phage classification workflow. A primary function is the identification and prediction of viral sequences within genomic or metagenomic data. Addressing the limitations of purely database-dependent methods, tools like Virsorter2, VirFinder, and VirMiner employ different models for viral sequence prediction [3]. Virsorter2, for instance, utilizes a multi-classifier, expert-guided approach and can differentiate between lytic phages and prophages, assigning confidence levels to predictions [3]. Other tools leveraging machine learning and diverse methodologies for sequence identification include geNomad (sequence alignment and machine learning), DeepVirFinder (deep learning), VIBRANT (protein annotation signatures and neural networks), PPR-Meta (machine learning), viralVerify (combining sequence alignment, feature analysis, and machine learning), and MetaPhinder (sequence alignment) [2]. VirFinder v1.1 specifically employs a combination of k-mer frequencies and machine learning for sequence scoring [11]. Beyond identification, many tools offer functionalities for taxonomic classification, lifestyle prediction, host prediction, genome annotation, and prophage prediction [2,7]. For example, VIBRANT, VirSorter, and Virsorter2 are noted for their ability to annotate viral genomes and predict prophages [2].  

Performance characteristics, such as runtime and computational load, also vary significantly among tools employing different approaches. Comparative studies indicate that tools like Kraken2 and VirFinder are faster than more computationally intensive options such as VirSorter and VirSorter2 [2]. Comprehensive metagenomic studies often utilize a combination of tools representing different classification approaches, including k-mer composition, alignment, and markerbased methods [9,16].  

A notable trend in the development of phage classification resources is the move towards integrated platforms that combine multiple analytical modules within a single environment [13]. This integration, exemplified by web servers like PhaBOX or standalone systems like G-InforBIO, streamlines the workflow by allowing users to perform identification, classification, annotation, and other downstream analyses within one system, reducing the need to transfer data between disparate tools [7,21]. Such platforms aim to provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience, facilitating a systematic approach to phage characterization from raw sequence data.​

PhaBOX functions as a comprehensive web server specifically tailored for metagenomic phage sequence recognition and analysis [7]. It integrates several specialized modules, each contributing to a distinct aspect of phage characterization. PhaMer utilizes a Transformer model for accurate phage identification from metagenomic data [7]. PhaTYP employs a BERT model to predict phage lifestyles, such as lytic or lysogenic [7]. PhaGCN performs bacteriophage taxonomy classification using a graph convolutional network [7]. Finally, CHERRY predicts virus-prokaryotic interactions (host prediction) via a graph encoder-decoder model [7]. The integration of these modules within PhaBOX provides a streamlined workflow for comprehensive analysis, covering identification, lifestyle, taxonomy, and host prediction from sequence data [7].  

In contrast to tools focusing on broad identification or comprehensive analysis suites, PhageGT serves a highly specific utility: the analysis of dsDNA phage genome termini based on High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) reads [6]. This dialogbased application, developed using Visual Studio 2019 and $\mathsf { C } { + } { + }$ , employs specific algorithms to process HTS read data, calculate read frequencies at different genomic positions, and rank them [6]. It calculates a ratio $( R )$ comparing the highest frequency of an extracted sequence to the average sequence frequency, which is indicative of termini location and type [6].  

Analyzing genome termini is crucial for understanding phage replication strategies and can support classification efforts by providing structural information not readily available from sequence homology alone [6]. The software and test data are freely available, facilitating its adoption for this niche analysis [6].  

G-InforBIO provides an example of a broader integrated system for microbial genome analysis, encompassing functionalities relevant to phage research [21]. While not solely dedicated to phage classification, it simplifies genome analyses by integrating various pre-existing software programs, enabling efficient data handling and manipulation [21]. Key features include seamless data import from public databases like DDBJ and GenBank, automatic database construction, keyword-based data retrieval, and annotation editing [21]. It integrates numerous sequence analysis programs, such as ClustalW, various BLAST variants (BLAST, Blat, DDBJ Blast, MegaBLAST), and primer3, facilitating common genomic analyses like sequence comparison and alignment [21]. G-InforBIO also offers graphical visualization tools, including a Feature Viewer for mapping and comparing genomic features between two genomes, aiding comparative analysis relevant to phage evolution and genomics [21]. Data export options are available in standard formats like XML and tab-delimited text [21].​  

Comparing these tools reveals their distinct strengths and ideal use cases. geNomad excels in broad-spectrum viral identification and preliminary characterization from complex metagenomes using a hybrid ML/alignment approach [2]. PhaBOX offers a more specialized and integrated suite for analyzing identified phage sequences, providing predictions on lifestyle, taxonomy, and host through various machine learning models [7]. PhageGT fills a specific analytical need, focusing on the crucial task of determining dsDNA phage termini, a structural feature vital for classification and understanding replication, but requires specific HTS data [6]. G-InforBIO, as a general microbial genome analysis platform, supports fundamental tasks like sequence comparison, annotation management, and visualization relevant to manually curated phage genomes but does not provide automated phage identification or classification pipelines [21]. The limitations of these tools often relate to their scope (broad vs. specific), input data requirements (metagenomic reads, assembled genomes, HTS reads), or methodological focus (ML, alignment, specific algorithms, integration). Regardless of the tool, interpreting the detailed output files is paramount for deriving meaningful biological conclusions, whether it involves assessing prediction scores and features in geNomad and other identification tools like DeepVirFinder or VirSorter2 [2], understanding phylogenetic relationships from tools like MEGA 7.0 [9], or locating specific genomic features using viewers like those in G-InforBIO or CGView [9,21].  

# 8.3 Databases  

Comprehensive and well-annotated databases serve as an indispensable foundation for most phage classification tools, particularly those employing reference-based methodologies [4]. These resources provide the essential genomic and functional data required for sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis, and feature-based classification.​  

Several key databases are widely utilized in phage research and tool development. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) offers prominent resources such as the RefSeq Viral Database, recognized as a widely used repository for virus sequences [2,28]. NCBI GenBank is another crucial database, frequently employed for sequence homology searches, functional annotation of phage genomes, and the retrieval of phage and prophage genomes [9,13]. GenBank also serves as a primary location for depositing newly sequenced phage genomes [10]. As of one report, the NCBI database contained 19,625 phage genome records, representing a significant increase compared to phages obtained solely through isolation [4]. Beyond NCBI, databases like the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) are also sources for genome data [21]. Tools like ADAPT further process and curate complete or near-complete genomes from public databases for specific applications [20].  

In addition to general sequence repositories, specialized databases focusing on protein families and functional annotation are critical. These include the IMG/VR database, which contains data on viral protein families [11], the Pfam-A database [11], VOGDB (or pVOG) which compiles Viral Orthologous Groups [2,5,11], and KEGG [2]. These protein-centric databases are leveraged by tools like VIBRANT for annotation [2] and can assist in distinguishing viral sequences, such as removing host sequences based on viral protein hits [5]. Furthermore, databases focusing on specific environments, such as the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) database for the gut microbiome, provide context for studying associated phages [11].​  

Despite the progress in accumulating sequence data, currently available databases exhibit significant limitations, primarily concerning the incomplete representation of the vast phage diversity [4,16]. Estimates suggest that only a small fraction of extant microbial species, approximately 300,000 out of a potential trillion, have reference genomes available [16]. This substantial gap in reference data directly impacts the performance of reference-based classification tools, particularly when analyzing sequences from novel or poorly characterized phages [4]. The limitations necessitate alternative approaches like de novo assembly of reads for identifying and characterizing unrepresented microorganisms [16].  

Addressing these limitations requires sustained community efforts and the application of new technologies. Approaches such as culturomics, meta-viromics, and prophage analysis are vital for discovering and characterizing novel phages and integrating this new data into public repositories [4]. The continuous expansion and improvement of phage databases in terms of content, scope, annotation quality, and update frequency are paramount for advancing the field of phage classification and enabling more comprehensive analyses of viral communities.  

# 9. Benchmarking and Performance Evaluation  

Evaluating and comparing the performance of phage classification tools is critical for selecting the most appropriate method for a given task and for driving future tool development [12,16]. This section delves into the methodologies employed for such evaluations, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarking workflows [12,16].  

![](images/8abd47f11175f28faee2613b1ed6a2a75d8d19fce6b0cd8eca024d326faf119c.jpg)  

A fundamental aspect of benchmarking involves the careful selection or creation of appropriate datasets, ranging from curated reference genomes with established taxonomy to simulated data designed to replicate the complexities and challenges encountered in real-world scenarios, such as fragmented sequences from metagenomic assemblies [11,12,16].  

Benchmarking studies utilize a suite of performance metrics to quantitatively assess different facets of tool capabilities [5,7,12,15,16,30]. These metrics, which may include accuracy, precision, recall (sensitivity), and F1-score, provide insights into a tool's ability to correctly identify phages and assign them to specific taxonomic ranks while minimizing false positives and false negatives [5,7,12,15,16,30]. Advanced metrics like Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) and Area Under the PrecisionRecall Curve (AUPR) are also employed to evaluate performance across various confidence thresholds, particularly in scenarios with imbalanced datasets [15,16,20,30]. Beyond standard classification, evaluations may incorporate applicationspecific metrics or assess a tool's impact on downstream analyses like diversity estimation [5,12].  

Key benchmarking studies have illuminated the relative strengths and weaknesses of prominent tools when applied to diverse conditions and data types [5,7,12,16]. These evaluations often reveal how tools perform when classifying novel phages with low sequence similarity to reference databases or when processing challenging metagenomic data characterized by short contigs, high host background, or varying community structures [5,7,11,12,16]. The findings of these benchmarks are instrumental in guiding researchers towards tools best suited for their specific research questions and data characteristics.​  

Furthermore, the evolving nature of phage taxonomy, particularly updates promulgated by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), profoundly impacts both the development and benchmarking of classification tools [4,12]. Changes in taxonomic frameworks, such as the restructuring of major phage families, necessitate updates to tool databases and algorithms to ensure accurate classification according to the current standards [4,7,12]. Benchmarking studies are crucial for assessing how well tools adapt to these changes and evaluating their performance under the latest taxonomic guidelines [12]. This ongoing interplay between taxonomic advancements and computational tool development highlights the dynamic landscape of phage classification.​  

# 9.1 Benchmarking Studies and Datasets  

Benchmarking studies are essential for evaluating the performance and applicability of phage classification tools across various biological contexts and data types [12,16]. A primary rationale for experimental design in these studies is to assess tool performance under conditions mimicking real-world applications, such as classifying phages from complex metagenomic samples [11,12,16]. This often necessitates evaluating tools not only on complete, high-quality reference genomes but also on fragmented sequences characteristic of metagenomic assemblies [11,12].​  

Commonly used datasets in phage classification benchmarking include curated reference databases such as RefSeq [5,7,12]. These often focus on specific groups, such as complete sequences under the class \textit{Caudoviricetes}, sometimes filtered to include only those infecting bacteria, and are partitioned into training and testing sets to evaluate family-level classification accuracy [12]. The use of such well-annotated datasets provides a baseline for tool performance on ideal data.  

To simulate metagenomic conditions, benchmarking studies frequently employ datasets consisting of short contigs or genome fragments [11,12]. These can be generated by randomly cutting segments of varying lengths from reference genomes [12]. This approach allows for the assessment of how tool performance degrades with decreasing sequence length, a critical factor in metagenomic analysis where assembled contigs can be short [12].  

Furthermore, simulated metagenomic datasets are widely used to evaluate tools designed for complex microbial communities [5,7,11,12,16]. These datasets are constructed from reads simulating specific environments, such as the human gut, including genome fragments from diverse viruses (e.g., crAss-like phages, Lak-phages) and non-viral sequences from bacteria and plasmids [11,12]. They may also incorporate curated sets of laboratory-generated and simulated standards with detailed annotations, including negative controls like human reference material or synthetic sequences, to rigorously test specificity [16]. Simulating communities allows researchers to control species composition and abundance, providing a ground truth for evaluation [11,12,16].  

Beyond general metagenomics, specialized datasets are used to evaluate tools for particular tasks or target groups [10,12,15,16,20]. Examples include datasets focused on specific bacterial hosts like \textit{Acinetobacter} strains for host prediction methods [10], datasets of phage virion proteins for protein-based classification [15], or sequences of specific viral groups like Enterovirus B for evaluating viral design tools [20]. Studies also employ low-similarity datasets, where test sequences share minimal similarity with the training data, to assess a tool's ability to handle novel or divergent sequences [12]. Public metagenomic datasets, such as those from IMG/VR, provide opportunities to test tools on real-world data complexity [7].  

The characteristics of the benchmarking dataset significantly influence the perceived performance of tools. Performance metrics like sensitivity and precision can vary widely depending on sequence length; tools typically perform better on longer contigs and complete genomes than on short fragments [12]. The inclusion and composition of non-phage sequences in mock or simulated metagenomes are crucial for evaluating a tool's specificity and false positive rate [11,16]. Datasets containing sequences with low similarity to the reference challenge tools reliant on sequence alignment or homology, favoring methods that utilize broader genomic features or machine learning [12]. Therefore, selecting appropriate datasets that reflect the intended application domain (e.g., environmental vs. human gut metagenomics, genome-based vs. protein-based classification) is paramount for obtaining a meaningful and representative evaluation of phage classification tools [11,12,15,16].  

# 9.2 Evaluation Metrics  

Evaluating the performance of phage classification tools requires the application of various metrics, each offering a distinct perspective on a tool's strengths and weaknesses. These metrics are fundamental for understanding how well a method performs, particularly in the context of classification tasks [17]. Common metrics used in the field include accuracy, precision, recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate), and F1-score [5,7,12,15,16,30].​  

These standard metrics provide different insights into classification performance. Accuracy, for instance, measures the overall proportion of correct predictions [7,12,15], calculated as the ratio of sequences with correct predictions to the total number of sequences evaluated:​  

$$
A c c u r a c y = \frac { N _ { c o r r e c t } } { N _ { t o t a l } }
$$  

However, accuracy alone can be misleading, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class significantly outnumbers others. In such cases, a high accuracy might simply reflect the ability to correctly classify the majority class while performing poorly on the minority class.  

Precision and recall offer a more nuanced view by focusing on the correct identification of positive cases (e.g., phage sequences or specific phage types). Precision quantifies the proportion of true positives among all instances predicted as positive, effectively measuring the rate of false positives. High precision is crucial when minimizing false identifications is critical, ensuring high confidence in the positive predictions. It is calculated for a specific class \( i \) as:​  

$$
P r e c i s i o n _ { i } = \frac { T P _ { i } } { T P _ { i } + F P _ { i } }
$$  

Recall, conversely, measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances, indicating the rate of false negatives. High recall is important when the goal is to identify as many positive instances as possible, minimizing missed detections. It is calculated for a specific class $\langle ( \mathfrak { i } \backslash )$ as:​  

$$
R e c a l l _ { i } = \frac { T P _ { i } } { T P _ { i } + F N _ { i } }
$$  

The true-positive rate (TPR) and false-positive rate (FPR) are related concepts, with TPR being equivalent to recall or sensitivity, and FPR measuring the rate of false positives among actual negative instances [11,15].  

The F1-score provides a single metric that balances precision and recall, representing their harmonic mean [5,7,15,16]. Metrics such as Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC or auROC) and Area Under the Precision-Recall curve (auPR or AUPR) evaluate the classifier's performance across different classification thresholds, with auROC often used for overall discrimination ability and auPR being more informative for imbalanced datasets [15,16,20,30]. Other metrics like the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) also provide balanced evaluations, especially for binary classification [15]. For multiclass scenarios, extensions like multiclass AUC (MAUC) and multiclass geometric mean (G-mean) may be employed [28].​  

Critically, relying solely on one metric is often insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of phage classification tools [12]. A suite of metrics is essential because different research goals necessitate prioritizing different aspects of performance. For instance, a study aiming to maximize the discovery of novel phages might prioritize high recall to minimize false negatives, ensuring that potentially new sequences are not missed. Conversely, research focused on building high-confidence databases of known phages or designing specific viral targeting strategies [20] might prioritize high precision to minimize false positives, ensuring that included sequences or predicted interactions (e.g., virus-prokaryotic interactions evaluated by CHERRY [7]) are highly reliable.  

Beyond standard classification performance, evaluation can also involve metrics related to taxonomic consistency, such as the ability to delineate known species, identify misclassifications, and maintain alignment with existing classifications, sometimes using metrics like Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) with specific cutoffs [10]. For tools assessing the composition of viral communities, metrics like Shannon and Simpson alpha diversity indices and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity for beta diversity may be used to evaluate the impact on diversity estimation [5]. Some evaluations may also consider metrics specific to the tool's output format or application, such as a "prediction rate" which measures the proportion of input sequences for which a prediction is provided [12], calculated as:​  

$$
\mathrm { P r e d i c t i o n \ r a t e } = \frac { N _ { p r e d } } { N _ { a l l } }
$$  

Other application-specific metrics can include Spearman's \(\rho\) for regression performance or biological assay metrics like fluorescent signal and limit of detection for evaluating the effectiveness of sequence-based designs [20]. Metrics like Cohen's Kappa statistic and L1 distance between relative abundance vectors may also be utilized for specific comparative analyses [16,28].​  

In conclusion, a thorough evaluation of phage classification tools necessitates the use of a diverse set of metrics. This multifaceted approach allows researchers to assess different facets of tool performance, understand trade-offs between metrics like precision and recall, and select the most appropriate tool based on specific research objectives and the nature of the dataset being analyzed. Further details on machine learning evaluation metrics can be found in [17].​  

# 9.3 Impact of Classification Frameworks (ICTV)  

Phage taxonomy is a field characterized by its dynamic nature, significantly influenced by governing bodies such as the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [4,12]. Updates and revisions to the ICTV classification framework have a profound impact on the field, necessitating the re-evaluation and adaptation of existing computational tools and guiding the development of new ones [12]. For instance, recent changes proposed by ICTV include the abandonment of the classification order Caudovirales in 2021, retaining only the description of Caudoviricetes, and the decision in October 2022 to use various phage morphologies solely for descriptive purposes rather than as a direct basis for classification [4]. A notable consequence of these updates is the substantial restructuring of phage families; the three largest families under the former Caudovirales classification, namely _Siphoviridae_, _Podoviridae_, and _Myoviridae_, have been largely removed from the current ICTV system [7,12]. This shift has resulted in some sequences previously assigned to these families not belonging to any existing family within the revised framework, underscoring the critical need for classification tools to be capable of recognizing sequences outside the current system [12].  

The changes in the ICTV framework directly impact the performance and relevance of classification tools. Adapting to these new standards is essential for tools to provide accurate and current taxonomic assignments. Several existing tools have undergone updates to comply with the latest ICTV standards, including PhaGCN, which specifically incorporated the removal of the major families _Siphoviridae_, _Podoviridae_, and _Myoviridae_ from the Caudovirales order [7]. Other tools recognized for adapting to the new ICTV standards include vConTACT 2.0, CAT, and MMseqs2 [7]. The vConTACT software, which employs gene sharing networks for classifying uncultured viral sequences, has demonstrated a high degree of overlap ( $9 6 \%$ at the genus level) with ICTV classification standards, indicating successful alignment with the official framework [3]. Furthermore, ICTV itself recommends specific tools, such as the Viral Proteomic Tree server (ViPtree) v4.0, for tasks like family-level classification [13].  

Benchmarking studies play a vital role in evaluating the impact of these framework changes on tool performance [12]. By assessing how tools classify phages under the new guidelines, these studies demonstrate the effectiveness of tool adaptation and highlight areas where classification remains challenging due to the evolving nature of the taxonomy. The revised framework, by providing potentially more robust or granular definitions for certain taxonomic ranks, may contribute to making specific classification tasks, such as family-level assignment, more consistent and feasible [12]. Practical application of ICTV standards is routinely seen in phage studies, whether classifying individual phages like vB_EcoM_F2 into the _Myoviridae_ family, _Tevenvirinae_ subfamily, and _Mosigvirus_ genus [9], or assigning viruses from large metagenomic datasets to ICTV families based on alignments to reference genomes [11]. These examples underscore the  

foundational role of the ICTV framework in phage research and the critical need for classification tools to accurately reflect its current state.  

# 10. Applications of Phage Classification Tools  

Accurate and efficient phage classification plays a crucial role in enabling a wide array of phage-based applications across diverse fields [14,22]. By providing a systematic framework for understanding the vast diversity of bacteriophages, classification tools facilitate targeted research and development efforts.  

In the realm of phage therapy, robust classification is indispensable for identifying phages with desirable characteristics, such as specific host ranges, potent lytic activity against target bacteria, and favorable safety profiles [22,26,27,33]. The accurate assessment of host range and virulence is paramount for selecting appropriate phages for therapeutic use, particularly in the face of rising antimicrobial resistance posed by pathogens like methicillin-resistant Staphylococ usaureus and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae[20,26]. Historical examples, such as the work by Herelle and the longstanding practice at the Eliava Institute, underscore the potential of phage therapy, which is revitalized today for applications including treating nosocomial infections and combating drug-resistant bacteria in conditions like COVID-19 [26,33]. Classification enables the rational design of personalized or broad-spectrum phage formulations and the analysis of bacterial lytic spectra using phage libraries [33]. Advances in understanding phage taxonomy and biology, supported by classification, are fundamental for developing enhanced therapeutic approaches, including those utilizing gene editing tools [35]. A novel strategy involving personalized phage selection based on predicted evolutionary trade-offs highlights the potential for classification to inform innovative treatment strategies [22]. Studies identifying and characterizing novel phage groups, such as specific coliphages, directly contribute to expanding the potential therapeutic repertoire and require accurate classification [13].​  

Microbiome research heavily relies on phage classification to characterize diverse phage populations within different environments and understand their intricate influence on bacterial community structure and function [18,22]. Accurate phage identification and classification are essential for studying the roles of phages in controlling host population sizes and affecting community functions within these complex ecosystems [5]. Classification tools enable researchers to study phage diversity, analyze phage-bacteria interactions, and understand how these dynamics shape microbial communities [13,18,22,27]. The ability to classify phages aids in applications such as predicting diseases or understanding the impact of factors like diet on gut microbiota, potentially by identifying phages that target specific bacterial species or predicting the outcomes of phage-bacteria interactions [34]. Tools providing phage identification, taxonomic classification, lifestyle prediction, and host prediction, such as PhaBOX, are instrumental in advancing microbiome research by offering essential analytical capabilities [7].​  

Classification also significantly aids in the study of phage ecology and evolution, including fundamental processes like horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and adaptation to hosts [22,27]. By classifying phages, researchers can trace viral lineages, identify evolutionary adaptations, and study biogeographical distribution [22]. Genomic language models, for example, can predict HGT frequencies, offering insights relevant to phage evolution [19]. Understanding phage-associated chromosomal rearrangements and deletions in bacterial genomes also contributes to comprehending the evolutionary interplay between phages and their hosts [21].​  

In the field of biotechnology, phage classification facilitates the identification of phages possessing valuable enzymes, such as depolymerases, which have potential applications in various industries [14]. Furthermore, classification supports the use of phages in synthetic biology applications, allowing for the rational design and engineering of phages for specific purposes [14,22]. Biocontrol and biosensing are other areas where classified phages can be utilized effectively [14,22]. Genomic language models, by characterizing unknown proteins and predicting gene function, can help uncover novel biotechnological assets encoded within phage genomes [19].​  

Finally, phage classification is relevant to diagnostics, particularly in identifying bacterial pathogens. Phages can be used as tools to detect specific bacteria [14,22], and accurate classification of these phages is necessary for developing specific and sensitive detection methods [29]. Principles derived from developing sensitive viral diagnostics for eukaryotic viruses can be adapted for phage-based diagnostics, emphasizing the need for lineage-level specificity [20]. Understanding the context of pathogen identification, such as in foodborne outbreaks, highlights the broader relevance of accurate phage classification to public health [32]. Tools like PhaBOX, by providing phage and host prediction, directly contribute to these diagnostic applications [7].​  

Overall, improved phage classification tools have led to significant advancements across these fields, providing fundamental insights and enabling novel applications from targeted therapeutics to environmental monitoring and industrial processes.  

# 11. Challenges and Future Directions  

The field of phage classification is currently navigating a complex landscape defined by significant technical and conceptual challenges [4,29]. A fundamental difficulty stems from the immense and incompletely sampled diversity of bacteriophages, exacerbated by the rapid acceleration of sequencing technologies that produce data far exceeding our current capacity for comprehensive characterization and manual curation [4,5,7,27]. This disparity is evident in the vast number of available genomic records compared to the relatively limited number of isolated phages [4]. A substantial portion of viral genes still lack preliminary functional annotation, highlighting the need for improved function prediction alongside classification [11]. Furthermore, the unique evolutionary dynamics of phages, marked by high rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and genomic mosaicism, complicate traditional classification methods reliant on conserved genes or linear phylogeny, as HGT can blur phylogenetic signals [10,13]. Classifying novel or underrepresented phages is particularly challenging due to their limited presence or absence in reference datasets [4,20,28].​  

A critical impediment remains the state of reference databases, which are often limited in comprehensiveness, accuracy, and standardization [4]. Incomplete representation and sampling biases within existing databases hinder the effective classification of new data and downstream applications, such as designing detection assays [5,20,27,28]. Inconsistencies among different classification tools and databases, potentially stemming from varying methodologies or training data biases, further complicate obtaining reliable and uniform results [5]. The quality of annotation information also directly impacts classification accuracy [21]. Adapting databases and tools to comply with evolving international standards, such as those from ICTV, presents an ongoing challenge [7].  

Analyzing the increasingly large genomic and metagenomic datasets poses significant computational bottlenecks [29]. Advanced classification techniques require substantial computational resources and efficient infrastructure [29]. Applying machine learning methods, while promising, introduces challenges related to data quality, bias management, selecting the optimal classifier, interpreting complex models, and ensuring predictable performance on new data [5,28,30,34]. Issues such as false positives in metagenomic analyses and the difficulty in assembling phage sequences from metagenomes further underscore the need for robust and validated methods [16,18].​  

Addressing these multifaceted challenges necessitates a concerted effort across computational and experimental domains. Future research directions must focus on developing more sophisticated algorithms, particularly leveraging cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including deep learning and genomic language models, to enhance classification accuracy and robustness [7,19,20,34]. This involves developing new genome analysis tools and refining existing models and predictors [16,21]. Expanding and improving data resources is paramount, requiring continuous database updates and additions of newly discovered viral genomes to training sets [5,7]. Future data generation strategies should actively utilize emerging technologies such as meta-viromics, culturomics, and single-cell genomics to capture greater diversity, including through prophage identification and sequencing archived strains [4,10,20,27]. Automated isolation techniques could further bolster data availability [4].​  

Integrating different types of biological data, such as multi-omics data including proteomics and transcriptomics, is crucial for a more comprehensive understanding and improved classification model performance [20,30,34]. Leveraging bacterial genomic data to improve phage host prediction is also a key area [29]. Emerging technologies like long-read sequencing hold significant promise for improving genome assembly, particularly from complex metagenomic samples, potentially enhancing classification by providing more contiguous sequence data [16,20].  

The development of standardized protocols, benchmarks, and databases through community-driven initiatives is essential to facilitate data sharing, comparison, and interoperability between tools [4,16,20,27]. Fostering interdisciplinary collaboration is vital for integrating expertise from diverse fields [20]. Methodological advancements, such as combining outputs from multiple tools, applying optimized parameters, developing user-friendly platforms [5,7,21], exploring novel typing methods like TSP-typing [14], correcting sampling biases [20], and utilizing updated phylogenetic markers [25], represent specific avenues for progress. Ultimately, advancements in phage classification directly support critical applications like phage therapy, which relies on rapid and accurate identification and characterization of phages with therapeutic potential [1,26,33,35].​  

# 11.1 Current Challenges  

Phage classification faces numerous significant challenges driven by the unique nature and vast scale of bacteriophage diversity [5,7,27]. A primary difficulty is the rapid growth of available sequence data, which far outpaces the capacity for manual curation and detailed classification. While traditional methods often necessitate obtaining pure phage cultures—a time-consuming and throughput-limiting process—the number of phage whole-genome records in public databases like NCBI dramatically exceeds the number of isolated phages (e.g., 19,625 records versus 3,125 related papers on isolated phages as of March 2023) [4]. This disparity highlights the vast amount of unclassified or partially classified sequence data. Even with large-scale annotation efforts, preliminary biological functions can only be assigned to a limited fraction (e.g., $2 5 \%$ ) of viral genes, underscoring the need for improved function prediction methods alongside classification [11]. The sheer scale and incomplete sampling of this diversity represent major obstacles [7,27].​  

The unique evolutionary dynamics of phages, particularly the high rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and genome mosaicism, fundamentally challenge traditional classification methods based on conserved genes or a linear phylogeny [13]. Methods relying on gene content can be limited by the extensive HGT [10], as genetic exchange blurs the phylogenetic signals typically used for species or genus demarcation in other organisms. This mosaic nature means that different parts of a phage genome can have distinct evolutionary histories, complicating efforts to establish consistent taxonomic units using single markers or concatenated gene sequences.​  

A critical need exists for more comprehensive, accurate, and better-curated reference databases [4]. The limited availability and incomplete representation of phage diversity in current databases are significant impediments [5,27]. Sampling biases within existing databases can hinder downstream applications, such as the effective design of detection assays for novel viruses or those with limited representation [20]. Incomplete databases directly contribute to a higher frequency of unclassified reads or incorrect taxonomic assignments in metagenomic analyses [16]. Furthermore, inconsistencies between different classification tools and databases, potentially arising from varying methodologies or training data biases, add to the challenge of obtaining reliable and uniform classification results [5]. The quality of annotation information, such as predicted coding regions, also directly affects the accuracy of classification analyses [21].  

Finally, the computational burden associated with analyzing vast and complex genomic datasets poses another significant challenge [29]. Advanced classification and analysis methods require substantial computational resources and efficient infrastructure [29]. Historical constraints on computational capacity have previously limited the scale of de novo gene family building and analysis, necessitating specific strategies to manage the data volume [25]. Addressing these computational demands requires the development of more efficient algorithms and scalable computing infrastructure. Challenges common to applying machine learning to complex biological data—including the need for high-quality datasets, interpreting complex models, and managing data bias—are also relevant in the context of developing advanced phage classification tools [30]. The recognized issue of false positives in metagenomics, although strategies have been proposed, highlights the ongoing need for robust validation and comparative analysis of classification methods [16].  

# 11.2 Future Research Directions and Emerging Technologies  

Advancing the field of phage classification necessitates simultaneous progress in both algorithmic capabilities and data generation strategies. Future research pathways involve developing more sophisticated computational tools and expanding the scope and quality of available biological data.  

A key area for future development lies in the application of cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques [1,30,34]. This includes exploring advanced algorithms such as deep learning and genomic language models to improve the accuracy and robustness of classification tools [7,20]. Developing new genome analysis tools and algorithms will be crucial, potentially leveraging object-oriented architectures for enhanced integration of diverse programming languages [21]. Furthermore, the development of trained predictors and variations on existing models merits further investigation [16]. Leveraging AI and machine learning to simulate complex biological interactions, such as phage–host dynamics, and predicting new mechanisms from unexplained data represent promising avenues [1].  

Alongside algorithmic advancements, expanding and improving data resources is paramount. This involves actively updating databases and models to comply with the latest standards and continuously adding newly discovered viral genomes to training datasets [5,7]. Strategies for database expansion include utilizing emerging technologies such as metaviromics, culturomics, and single-cell genomics, which are vital for filling gaps in databases and enhancing phage classification [4,20,27]. Prophage identification is also highlighted as a critical approach to contribute to database  

comprehensiveness [4]. Furthermore, genome sequencing of all strains archived in culture collections is expected to become more technically and economically feasible, significantly contributing to data availability [10]. Broader host range screening and automated workstation models may also offer new directions for phage isolation and culture, contributing to data generation [4]. Metagenomics itself is recognized as a significant future trend for phage analysis [4]. Future studies could also extend analysis beyond DNA viruses to include RNA viruses or gene expression patterns using metatranscriptomics data [11].  

Integrating different types of biological data is essential to gain a more complete picture of phage biology relevant to classification. This includes the integration of multi-omics data, such as proteomics and transcriptomics, to improve the performance and robustness of classification models [20,30,34]. Multi-phasic single nucleotide polymorphism studies could also be employed to understand the timing of different anti-infection mechanisms, providing deeper insights into phage– host interactions relevant to classification [1]. Leveraging genomic data more effectively to characterize bacteria is also critical, particularly for improving host prediction in phage classification [29].  

The role of long-read sequencing technologies, such as MinION nanopore, 10X Genomics, or PacBio sequencers, is crucial for improving genome assembly, especially in complex metagenomic samples, and potentially enhancing classification accuracy by providing more contiguous genomic information [16,20]. These technologies can help avoid ambiguous mapping of reads from conserved regions [16].​  

Emphasizing community-driven initiatives is vital for standardization and database curation [4,20,27]. The adoption of standardized criteria, workflows, and file formats is necessary to combine outputs from various tools and ensure interoperability [16,20]. Fostering interdisciplinary collaborations is also highlighted as important for future progress [20].  

Specific methodological advancements may also contribute. For instance, combining outputs from multiple tools can lead to more comprehensive analysis [5]. Applying optimized thresholds and parameters derived from benchmark studies can improve results [5]. Developing more user-friendly tools and integrated platforms that combine multiple functionalities represent steps toward more accessible solutions [7,21]. Advancements in specific typing methods, such as "TSP-typing" based on phage-encoded depolymerases, offer potentially more specific, accurate, and easier alternatives to traditional methods for bacterial host typing, which is intrinsically linked to phage classification [14]. Future work might also explore novel approaches to correct for sampling biases by weighing genomes [20] or utilizing updated phylogenetic marker databases like SFAMs [25]. While specific phage therapy-related research directions like NEPT strategy, identifying synergistic antibiotics, or developing rapid AST devices [33] or engineering phages with broader host ranges [26] are application-focused, their underlying need for accurate phage–host classification remains critical and drives the necessity for improved classification tools. Similarly, strategies like "taming" highly pathogenic bacteria with phages [1] rely on a detailed understanding of phage biology and classification.​  

In summary, the future of phage classification lies in the synergistic advancement of sophisticated ML/AI algorithms, comprehensive data generation through emerging technologies and database expansion, effective integration of diverse biological data types, adoption of long-read sequencing, and robust community-driven standardization efforts.  

# 12. Conclusion  

This survey has examined the dynamic field of phage classification tools, highlighting the significant evolution from traditional methods to sophisticated genomics‐driven and machine learning‐based approaches. The transition has been necessitated by the exponential growth of available phage sequence data, particularly from metagenomic studies [18].

Machine learning and deep learning models are increasingly being developed for tasks ranging from classifying phage virion proteins [15] to designing diagnostics with improved sensitivity and specificity [20], and leveraging genomic context for functional predictions [19]. Integrated platforms consolidate various analysis steps, from identification to taxonomic classification and host prediction, providing user‐friendly interfaces for researchers with diverse computational backgrounds [7,21].  

While significant progress has been made, challenges persist. Existing algorithms may have drawbacks in handling the complexity and novelty encountered in massive genomic and metagenomic datasets [29]. Classifying environmental samples remains challenging due to factors like sequencing depth, sample complexity, and potential contamination [16]. The rapid rate of genome sequencing necessitates continuous automation and improvement of methods to keep pace [25]. Furthermore, careful consideration and selection of appropriate evaluation metrics are crucial for reliably assessing model performance, especially in machine learning applications, along with ensuring result reproducibility and addressing potential biases [17].​  

Despite these challenges, the future of phage classification is marked by exciting opportunities. Continued development of computational methods, including the incorporation of information beyond traditional marker genes [25] and integration of diverse data types, holds immense potential. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, particularly those that can capture complex biological information from genomic context [19], will likely lead to more accurate and nuanced classifications. The need for further research into phage biology and the establishment of standardized criteria for applications like phage therapy underscore the importance of robust classification tools in enabling future discoveries [26]. The field is inherently dynamic, with the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) continuously updating the official classification framework as new data emerges [4,12]. Keeping pace with this explosion of data and the evolving taxonomic landscape necessitates ongoing innovation in tool development and application.​  

Future literature reviews could delve into specific aspects of this field, such as conducting comprehensive benchmarking studies of tools tailored for particular environments or sample types [5,12,16]. Another crucial area for future analysis is the direct impact of new ICTV updates on the performance and applicability of existing and newly developed classification tools.
