# 1. Introduction  

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which delineate the intricate interactions among transcription factors (TFs), their target genes, and associated regulatory elements, are pivotal for comprehending fundamental cellular processes, dictating cell identity and fate, and orchestrating responses to internal and external stimuli [3,7,24,25]. Alterations in gene expression, driven by the dynamics of these networks, are central to biological processes throughout development, maintenance of homeostasis, and the progression of diseases [7,15,28]. Reconstructing these complex biological networks from highthroughput molecular data represents a significant and ongoing challenge within the fields of systems biology and bioinformatics [6,27].​  

The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has fundamentally transformed the study of gene regulation by enabling the measurement of gene expression profiles at unprecedented single-cell resolution [2,17]. This granularity facilitates the identification of discrete cell types, the tracking of dynamic biological processes such as cell differentiation and lineage development, and the detailed investigation of complex phenomena like intratumoral heterogeneity in cancer [2,17,21,24]. The substantial number of cellular samples accessible through scRNA-seq technology provides a foundation for more accurate analysis of gene-gene associations and transcriptional networks compared to traditional bulk sequencing methods [2]. Consequently, the field has witnessed a substantial proliferation in the development of computational methods specifically designed for GRN inference using scRNA-seq data [2,3,7,9,18,21].​  

Nevertheless, the unique characteristics of scRNA-seq data introduce distinct computational challenges for accurate GRN inference [9,18]. These include the presence of higher noise levels and significant data sparsity, often characterized by dropout events, when compared to bulk RNA-seq [9]. Stochastic variations inherent at the single-cell level complicate the robust determination of GRNs underlying stable cellular states [10]. Furthermore, inferring robust networks requires overcoming the limitation of learning from a relatively restricted number of independent biological replicates despite the large number of profiled cells [29]. Technical artifacts such as batch effects in multi-sample datasets also necessitate specialized computational strategies [8]. A critical challenge remains the necessity to establish causal regulatory relationships rather than merely identifying statistical correlations, which is paramount for understanding network dynamics and predicting cellular responses to perturbations [13,33]. These challenges simultaneously highlight opportunities for developing innovative computational approaches capable of effectively leveraging the rich data provided by scRNA-seq and integrated single-cell multi-omics (e.g., single-cell epigenomics) [1,9,12]. Such methods should ideally incorporate prior biological knowledge (e.g., from cis-regulatory analysis or TF-binding motifs) and improve inference accuracy, particularly within complex and heterogeneous biological contexts such as tumor microenvironments [10,18,29].​  

This survey provides a comprehensive review of computational methods for gene regulatory network inference, with a primary focus on approaches utilizing single-cell transcriptomic and multi-omic data [1,3,9,17,18]. We synthesize the stateof-the-art algorithms, elaborate on their methodological underpinnings, critically discuss the unique challenges and promising opportunities presented by single-cell data, and explore the diverse applications of inferred GRNs across various biological domains [1,3,9,17,18]. By reviewing the current landscape and outlining future directions, this survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and method developers navigating the rapidly evolving field of GRN reconstruction in the single-cell era [1,3].​  

# 2. Background on Gene Regulatory Networks and Transcriptomics Technologies  

Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) represent the intricate system of interactions governing gene expression and dictating cellular behavior [7,13,29]. Fundamentally, GRNs are interpretable computational models, often depicted as graphs, that illustrate the dynamic regulatory mechanisms controlling the transcriptional state of a cell [3,7,10]. These networks involve complex relationships, including regulation chains, auto-regulations, and feedback loops, responding to diverse stimuli over time [28]. Understanding these interactions is crucial for deciphering the molecular processes underlying cellular differentiation, growth, development, and disease [1,12,13,15,24,26,27]. The basic components of a GRN include genes and regulatory factors, typically transcription factors (TFs), interacting to control gene expression [3,4,7,12]. TFs bind to specific DNA sequences, often within cis-regulatory elements, to activate or repress target gene transcription, a process influenced by chromatin accessibility [7,16,29]. Dysregulation of GRNs is frequently implicated in pathological conditions, underscoring the importance of accurate GRN inference for identifying potential therapeutic targets [12,26].  

Transcriptomic data, which quantifies gene expression levels, is a primary resource for inferring GRNs [3,16,19]. Early computational methods relied on data from technologies like DNA microarrays and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which measure the average gene expression across a population of cells [1,18,27]. While valuable, a significant limitation of bulk data is its inability to resolve cell-to-cell heterogeneity, masking cell-type-specific regulatory programs due to averaged measurements across diverse cell populations [1,3,7].  

The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology marked a transformative step, enabling the measurement of gene expression in individual cells and providing unprecedented resolution of cellular heterogeneity [1,10,17,18]. ScRNAseq allows for the inference of cell-type-specific or even cell-specific GRNs, which is critical for studying dynamic processes like cell fate transitions and differentiation trajectories [1,3,7,17,24,25]. However, scRNA-seq data presents unique computational challenges, including high sparsity (zero counts for expressed genes due to technical limitations) and noise, which necessitate specialized methods for accurate GRN inference compared to bulk data [8,9,15,17,18,20].  

Regardless of the technology used, rigorous data preprocessing is an essential prerequisite for GRN inference [7]. Key preprocessing steps involve quality control to remove low-quality data, normalization to account for variations in sequencing depth and other technical factors, and batch effect correction when combining data from different experiments [7,18,20,22]. These steps ensure the data is suitable for downstream computational analysis. Beyond transcriptomics, the increasing availability of single-cell multi-omics data, such as combined scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, offers opportunities to integrate information on chromatin accessibility to refine regulatory relationships and enhance GRN inference accuracy [1,12,25,29,31].​  

# 2.1 Gene Regulatory Network Fundamentals  

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) constitute a complex system of interactions that govern gene expression within cellular systems [7,13,29]. Fundamentally, GRNs model the dynamic regulatory mechanisms that determine the transcriptional state of a cell [10,15]. These networks are not merely static structures but represent the intricate interplay between molecular regulators responding to internal and external stimuli over time, involving complex mechanisms such as regulation chains, auto-regulations, and feedback loops [28]. Understanding these interactions is vital for deciphering cellular processes and molecular interactions that dictate cellular phenotypes [12,13].​  

The significance of GRNs extends across numerous fundamental biological processes. They play a key role in cellular differentiation, growth, and development [3,15], crucially controlling gene expression changes during cell lineage specification [24]. GRNs are central to controlling cell identity and cell fate decisions [1,9,25], reflecting the inner mechanisms underlying an organism's adaptability, growth, and development [27]. Moreover, dysregulation of GRNs can lead to the dysfunction of molecular pathways implicated in the occurrence and progression of various diseases, such as cancer [1,26]. Consequently, unraveling GRN architecture is crucial for identifying key regulators that could serve as targets for therapeutic intervention [9].​  

The basic components of a GRN include genes, regulatory factors, and the interactions between them [3,4,12]. Genes serve as the fundamental units encoding functional products like proteins or RNA, whose expression levels are subject to regulation [16]. Regulatory factors, most commonly transcription factors (TFs), are proteins that play a primary role in controlling the transcription rate of genes [7,12]. GRNs can be conceptually represented as networks where genes and regulatory factors act as nodes, and the regulatory relationships between them form the edges [19,20]. Chromatin, composed of DNA and proteins, provides structural support and influences gene accessibility, representing another crucial interacting component that affects gene expression [7,16].​  

A core mechanism within GRNs involves the action of transcription factors. TFs regulate gene transcription by binding to specific DNA sequences, known as DNA binding sites, typically located in cis-regulatory elements (CREs) such as promoters and enhancers [1,7,16,29]. The binding of TFs to these regions influences the recruitment and stabilization of the RNA  

polymerase complex, thereby activating or inhibiting the transcription of target genes [7,16]. Chromatin state significantly impacts this process; gene accessibility, determined by chromatin structure, can either hinder or promote TF access to binding sites [7,16]. Conversely, some TFs, referred to as pioneer TFs, can initiate changes in chromatin structure to make regulatory regions accessible [7]. Through these precise interactions, TFs and their associated cofactors orchestrate the complex network of gene expression, ultimately determining cell function, identity, and response to environmental signals [16]. The network structure often exhibits scale-free properties, where a few TFs (hub genes) have extensive regulatory connections, while most genes have limited interactions, aligning with the biological observation that a limited number of TFs control the expression of many downstream genes [10,20]. Methods like Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identify modules of co-expressed genes potentially under the control of such regulatory networks, using concepts like connectivity, module eigengenes, and hub genes to explore the relationship between gene networks and phenotypes [11,32]. These collective interactions within the GRN fundamentally affect cellular behavior by modulating the protein and RNA products available to the cell.  

# 2.2 Transcriptomics Data and Technologies  

Transcriptomic data, which measures gene expression levels, serves as a fundamental data type for inferring Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) [3,16,19]. Early computational methods for GRN inference primarily utilized data from bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) or microarray technologies, which quantify average gene expression across entire cell populations [1,27]. These bulk methods often relied on inferring GRNs from gene co-expression patterns [7,19]. However, a significant limitation of bulk sequencing data is its inability to capture cell-type-specific information due to the mixed measurements across heterogeneous cell types within a tissue sample [1,7]. This makes it challenging to discern regulatory programs specific to particular cell types or states [1,7].​

The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the field by providing high-resolution transcriptomic profiles of individual cells, thereby revealing cellular heterogeneity at unprecedented detail [1,10,17]. ScRNAseq technology is considered a key technology for constructing GRNs [4,8,12,14,15,17,18,21]. Unlike bulk RNA-seq, scRNAseq enables the construction of cell-type-specific or even cell-specific GRNs [1,3,7,17,25]. This higher resolution facilitates the study of cell fate decisions, allowing for the organization of cells in pseudo-temporal order, reconstruction of differentiation trajectories, and dissection of transient states at single-cell resolution [24].​  

While offering significant advantages, scRNA-seq data presents unique challenges for GRN inference. These include "dropout" events, where genes are undetected often due to technical limitations or low expression levels [9]. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of gene expression at the single-cell level poses difficulties for accurate GRN inference [8]. Analyzing scRNA-seq data requires addressing these challenges, along with standard steps such as cell type identification and trajectory inference, which are crucial for interpreting the data in a biological context.​  

Data preprocessing is a critical initial step for both bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data before GRN inference can be performed [7]. Common preprocessing steps include normalization to account for differences in library size and other technical variations, filtering to remove genes or cells with low expression or poor quality, and batch effect correction, particularly important when integrating data from different experiments or batches [7,18,20,22]. For RNA-seq data, normalization methods like the varianceStabilizingTransformation method from DESeq2 or simple transformations such as $\log 2 ( x + 1 )$ on standardized data (e.g., FPKM, CPM) are commonly employed [32]. These steps aim to produce a count table of gene expression values suitable for downstream analysis [9].​  

Beyond scRNA-seq, other single-cell omics technologies, such as single-cell chromatin accessibility data (scATAC-seq) and single-cell multiome data (integrating gene expression and chromatin accessibility), provide complementary information on regulatory elements [1,12,14,25,29,31]. Leveraging these multi-omics datasets enables more comprehensive and accurate GRN inference by incorporating insights into promoter and enhancer activity, including distal regulatory elements [1,25,29]. Spatial transcriptomics [3,22] and time course expression data [28] represent additional important data modalities increasingly used for studying gene regulation dynamics and spatial context. The increasing availability of large public genomics datasets, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), further fuels the development of computational methods for analyzing these diverse data types and understanding complex biological systems, including cancer mechanisms and tumor heterogeneity [26].​  

# 3. Computational Methods for GRN Inference from Transcriptomics Data  

Inferring Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from transcriptomics data is a fundamental challenge in systems biology, aiming to decipher the complex web of interactions that govern gene expression [7,9]. This process relies on the premise that observable patterns in gene expression contain valuable information about the underlying regulatory architecture [9]. Computational methods provide the necessary tools to model gene expression variation and infer these regulatory connections, treating the expression of certain genes (e.g., transcription factors) as potential regulators influencing the expression of others [1,3]. The inferred interactions can represent directed or undirected relationships, varying in strength and influence within the network structure [7].​  

The field has seen the development of a diverse array of computational approaches, each based on different statistical or algorithmic principles [1,2,3,7,27]. These methods broadly encompass correlation-based analyses, regression models, information theory-based approaches, probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian networks, dynamic systems modeling, machine learning techniques including deep learning, and sparse graph recovery methods [1,2,3,7,15]. The choice of method is often dictated by the nature of the transcriptomic data available (e.g., bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNAseq, time-series), the specific biological question being addressed, and the desired characteristics of the inferred network (e.g., static vs. dynamic, undirected vs. directed, global vs. cell-type specific) [6,9].​  

Different methods offer distinct advantages and face specific limitations [2,3,7]. Simpler approaches like correlation-based methods are computationally efficient but typically infer undirected associations and struggle to distinguish direct from indirect relationships [2,3,7]. More complex methods, such as regression, probabilistic models, and dynamic systems, attempt to infer directed or causal links and capture temporal dynamics, but often face challenges related to computational scalability, model complexity, and the need for substantial or specific types of input data [1,9,27,28]. Machine learning, particularly deep learning, holds promise for modeling complex non-linear interactions and integrating multi-omics data, but can suffer from issues of interpretability and the need for large training datasets [18,24,29,31]. Sparse graph methods aim to directly infer the network structure by imposing sparsity constraints, which can help in identifying direct interactions but may struggle with complex network features like feedback loops [15].  

The increasing availability of single-cell transcriptomic data has introduced new challenges and spurred adaptations of existing methods, requiring approaches that can handle data sparsity, high dimensionality, and cellular heterogeneity [3,9]. Newer methods often aim to overcome limitations of earlier approaches, for example, by integrating multi-omics data to improve confidence in inferred links or developing more efficient algorithms to handle large datasets [1,2,7].  

This section will provide a detailed overview of these computational methods, examining their underlying principles, typical algorithms, key assumptions, strengths, and limitations [2,3,7,15]. We will discuss their applicability to different types of transcriptomic data and how they are adapted to address the specific challenges posed by single-cell data [9]. Furthermore, we will trace the evolution of GRN inference methodologies, highlighting how advancements have sought to improve accuracy, scalability, and the ability to capture complex regulatory dynamics [2,7].  

# 3.1 Correlation-based Methods  

Correlation-based methods represent a fundamental approach to inferring Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) by identifying genes that exhibit similar expression patterns across different samples or conditions. This approach is rooted in the "guilt by association" principle, positing that genes with highly correlated expression profiles are likely to be functionally related or co-regulated [1,19]. These methods are widely used, particularly for large and high-dimensional single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, owing to their conceptual simplicity and computational efficiency [2,27]. Common measures employed include parametric Pearson correlation, which captures linear relationships, and non-parametric methods such as Spearman correlation and mutual information (MI), capable of detecting non-linear associations [1,27].​  

Despite their advantages in simplicity and computational speed [27], a significant limitation of correlation-based methods is their inherent inability to establish causality or directionality between genes [1,7,29]. Since correlation measures the degree of association symmetrically, these methods typically infer undirected edges in the network [7,29]. Furthermore, correlation alone struggles to differentiate between direct regulatory interactions and indirect relationships arising from shared upstream regulators or confounding factors [1]. This often leads to the inference of false-positive associations, affecting the accuracy and interpretability of the resulting networks [3,7].​  

Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) is a widely adopted correlation-based method that constructs a co-expression network by calculating pairwise correlations between genes and clustering genes with similar expression profiles into modules [3,7,23]. WGCNA commonly utilizes Pearson correlation coefficients [11]. A key step in WGCNA involves raising the absolute correlation values to a soft-thresholding power $( \beta )$ to transform the similarity matrix into an adjacency matrix that approximates a scale-free network topology, considered more biologically relevant [11,20]. The method identifies modules of highly correlated genes and can relate these modules to external phenotypic data or sample characteristics [2,22,32]. WGCNA is particularly well-suited for datasets with multiple groups or time series and a large number of samples, where it facilitates the identification of characteristic gene modules associated with different conditions [32]. However, like other correlation methods, WGCNA primarily identifies co-expression modules rather than causal regulatory links, limiting its mechanistic interpretability [3,7,29].​  

To address the limitation of distinguishing direct from indirect relationships, methods based on partial correlation and partial mutual information have been developed [2]. The partial and semi-partial correlation (PPCOR) method extends the concept by measuring the direct association between two genes after accounting for the linear influence of all other genes [2]. Similarly, Partial Mutual Information (PMI) identifies direct associations based on the principle of partial independence, utilizing information theory to potentially capture non-linear direct relationships [1,2]. While digests comparing the performance of PPCOR and PMI directly against WGCNA in detail are not provided here, conceptually, PPCOR and PMI aim to refine the association measurement beyond simple pairwise correlation by attempting to isolate direct dependencies, which represents a theoretical improvement over standard co-expression analysis like WGCNA, which does not explicitly account for confounding effects from other genes when inferring pairwise connections based solely on marginal correlation [2,7]. Methods like Partial Information Decomposition and Context (PIDC) further explore non-linear direct relationships using information theory [2].​  

Further improvements in the accuracy of GRN inference using correlation-based frameworks can be achieved by integrating context-specific information or prior knowledge. For instance, combining gene expression data with information from other modalities, such as ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing), which provides data on  

chromatin accessibility and potential regulatory regions, has the potential to help prioritize or prune correlated gene pairs and alleviate some of the limitations of purely correlation-based methods [1]. This integration can help filter spurious correlations and enrich for biologically plausible regulatory links.  

# 3.2 Regression-based Methods  

Regression-based methods represent a prominent class of approaches for inferring Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) by modeling the expression of a target gene as a function of the expression levels of potential regulatory factors, such as transcription factors (TFs) and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) [1,9]. In this framework, the expression of each gene is treated as a response variable, and the expression or accessibility of other potential regulators serve as predictor variables in a regression model [1]. The coefficients derived from the regression analysis quantify the strength and direction of the inferred regulatory associations [1].​  

A key advantage of regression-based methods, particularly those that distinguish between potential regulators (like TFs) and target genes, is their potential to infer directed interactions, thereby introducing a degree of causal inference in the network structure, in contrast to methods that infer undirected associations based purely on correlation or co-expression [3,7]. By focusing on predicting target gene expression from TF expression, these methods inherently reduce the number of potential interactions considered compared to all-pairwise correlation approaches, making the inference process potentially more precise and computationally manageable for large datasets [3,7]. However, like all models, regression methods are sensitive to model misspecification, meaning that if the assumed functional form of the regulatory relationship is incorrect, the inferred network may be inaccurate.​  

Compared to methods like Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), which identifies modules of coexpressed genes without explicitly distinguishing regulators from targets or inferring directionality, regression-based methods such as GENIE3 and GRNBoost2 offer a more direct approach to inferring directed regulatory links between specific TFs and target genes [2,7]. GENIE3, for instance, decomposes the GRN inference problem into a set of regression tasks, where the expression of each gene is predicted using tree-based ensemble methods like Random Forests or Extra Trees from the expression of other genes, specifically focusing on TFs as predictors for target genes [2,10]. The importance scores of TFs in predicting target gene expression are then used to assign weights to potential regulatory links [2,10]. GRNBoost2 builds upon the GENIE3 architecture but employs Gradient Boosting machines to enhance computational efficiency [2,31]. Both GENIE3 and GRNBoost2 are utilized in the SCENIC workflow as an initial step to infer co-expression modules between TFs and candidate target genes [4,8,10]. However, a limitation noted is that the modules inferred by these methods based purely on co-expression may include indirect targets, necessitating further filtering steps, such as motif enrichment analysis as performed in SCENIC, to derive high-confidence regulons [2,10].  

Different types of regression models have been employed for GRN inference. Simple linear regression can be used, but complex biological relationships often necessitate more flexible models. Penalized regression methods, such as LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), are particularly useful in the context of high-dimensional transcriptomic data, where the number of potential regulators can be large [1]. LASSO adds an L1 penalty term to the objective function, which encourages sparsity by shrinking the coefficients of less important predictors to zero, effectively performing variable selection and simplifying the inferred network structure [1]. Methods like CellOracle utilize cluster-wise regularized linear regression models, often incorporating multi-omics data, to infer cell-type- or cell-state-specific GRNs [25]. Tree-based ensemble methods (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting), as used by GENIE3 and GRNBoost2, offer non-linear modeling capabilities and robustness, inferring regulatory strength based on feature importance rather than linear coefficients [2]. The choice of regression model depends on assumptions about the underlying regulatory relationships, data characteristics, and computational resources [9].​  

# 3.3 Information Theory-based Methods  

Information theory-based methods for inferring gene regulatory networks leverage concepts such as mutual information (MI) to quantify the statistical dependence between gene expression levels [9]. MI is particularly valuable in biological data analysis due to its inherent ability to measure non-linear relationships between variables, which are prevalent in complex biological systems [27]. This capacity allows information theory approaches to capture interaction types that linear methods might miss. For instance, methods like ARACNe (Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks) infer _trans_-regulation between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes (TGs) by specifically capturing the covariation patterns between their expression profiles [29].  

Despite their strength in detecting non-linear dependencies, information theory-based methods can be sensitive to noise and may face computational complexity challenges, particularly with large datasets or high-dimensional single-cell data. Specific algorithms have been developed within this framework, including Context Likelihood of Relatedness (CLR) and Maximum Relevance/Minimum Redundancy Network (MRNET). While these methods aim to provide accurate inference, the robustness of information theory-based approaches to inherent noise and data variability present in transcriptomic data remains a critical aspect requiring careful consideration and analysis [6].​  

# 3.4 Probabilistic Models (e.g., Bayesian Networks)  

Probabilistic models constitute a significant class of methods for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from transcriptomic data. These approaches often utilize graphical models to capture the intricate dependencies between biological variables, such as transcription factors (TFs) and their potential target genes [1]. A primary objective of these methods is to probabilistically model the existence and quantify the strength of regulatory relationships between these components [1].​  

One of the key strengths of probabilistic models lies in their inherent ability to handle uncertainty within biological data, which is often noisy and variable. By representing relationships using probability distributions, they can provide a measure of confidence for each inferred regulatory edge. Furthermore, their graphical structure provides a natural framework for incorporating prior biological knowledge, such as known TF–target interactions or pathway information, which can help constrain the search space and improve inference accuracy.​  

Despite these advantages, probabilistic models—particularly Bayesian network–based methods—face limitations concerning scalability. Learning the exact network structure for a Bayesian network is classified as an NP-hard problem with respect to the number of genes [27]. This computational complexity restricts the application of exact structure learning algorithms primarily to relatively small datasets or subsets of genes [27]. Approaches are often positioned in the middle range regarding complexity and scale compared to other GRN inference methods [27].​  

![](images/9af24165b10bcc13ed0bcd1e34e5108f0060b9051c9338b1b16ab039616da4fd.jpg)  

Bayesian Networks (BNs) serve as foundational probabilistic graphical models for GRN inference, aiming to identify a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that best explains the observed gene expression data [27]. For dynamic systems or time-series transcriptomic data, Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) extend standard BNs by introducing a temporal dimension [28]. A DBN is typically defined as a pair  

$$
( B _ { 0 } , B _ {  } )
$$  

where $B _ { 0 }$ is a BN representing the initial state distribution over a set of random variables $X _ { 1 } , \ldots , X _ { n }$ ​ , and $B _ {  }$ ​ is a 2‑timeslice Bayesian network (2‑TBN) that models the probabilistic transitions from time slice $t$ to time slice $t + 1$ [28]. The structural learning in DBNs often involves optimizing a score function, such as the Bayesian score, defined as:  

$$
\log P ( D \mid \theta ) - { \frac { d } { 2 } } \log N
$$  

where $D$ represents the data, $\theta$ are the estimated parameters of the structure, $d$ is the number of parameters, and $N$ is the dimensionality of the data [28].  

While powerful for time-series data, DBNs typically assume discrete time points, often requiring evenly spaced measurements. This limitation can be addressed by Continuous-Time Bayesian Networks (CTBNs). A CTBN is a probabilistic graphical model whose state evolves continuously over time [28]. A CTBN comprises an initial probability distribution and the dynamics governing the evolution of the probability distribution over time [28]. CTBNs overcome the limitations of DBNs by explicitly representing temporal dynamics, which allows for the recovery of the probability distribution over time even when events occur between observation points [28].​  

Comparing DBNs and CTBNs, CTBNs hold significant advantages in modeling systems that evolve in continuous time and are particularly robust to unevenly spaced time series data, a common characteristic of biological experiments [28]. By explicitly modeling dwell times and transition rates, CTBNs can potentially offer higher accuracy for systems where the continuous nature of dynamics is crucial, unlike DBNs which rely on discrete transitions between time points. However, the computational efficiency of CTBNs compared to DBNs can vary depending on the specific learning algorithms and network structures involved. The explicit modeling of continuous dynamics in CTBNs can introduce computational complexities not present in discrete‑time DBNs, especially for large networks.​  

Beyond Bayesian networks, other probabilistic approaches are employed in the analysis of regulatory relationships. For instance, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and topic modeling—probabilistic methods originally developed for text analysis— have been adapted for biological data analysis, including single‑cell epigenomics data [31]. These methods can identify underlying regulatory modules or “topics” by modeling the probability distribution of features (e.g., accessible chromatin regions or gene expression profiles) across different cells or samples, highlighting their suitability for analyzing the heterogeneity inherent in single‑cell transcriptomic data. The suitability of different probabilistic models for GRN inference thus depends critically on the nature of the transcriptomic data available, including whether it is bulk or single‑cell, and whether it consists of discrete or continuous time measurements.​  

# 3.5 Dynamic Network Inference  

Dynamic networks offer a more suitable framework for characterizing transient changes in gene expression and network dynamics, particularly in complex biological processes such as cellular differentiation and lineage commitment, compared to static correlation‐based methods [2]. Dynamic systems models are capable of capturing various factors influencing gene expression, including its inherent stochasticity, and provide interpretable parameters corresponding to specific biological attributes [1]. The investigation of dynamic regulatory networks often involves measuring system variables across multiple time points [28].​  

Two prominent types of dynamic models used in GRN inference are Boolean networks and differential equation models, particularly ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Boolean models represent the simplest approach, discretizing gene expression into binary states (0 or 1, representing absence or presence) and utilizing Boolean logic operators (AND, OR, NOT) to describe gene interactions [2]. These models, exemplified by methods like SCNS and BoolTraineR, are frequently employed to deduce the logical combinations of transcription factors (TFs) necessary for cellular state transitions during dynamic biological processes [9]. Boolean networks can classify cells into distinct states based on TF expression profiles and identify key TFs driving state changes, enabling predictions about the impact of TF overexpression or knockdown [9]. However, Boolean models typically do not provide information regarding target genes, are computationally demanding, and are sensitive to technical artifacts such as dropout events in single‐cell data [9].  

Differential equation models, such as ODEs, aim to reconstruct gene expression profiles over time [28]. By identifying and clustering similar expression profiles, these models can facilitate the inference of causal relationships within the network [9]. An example is SCODE, an efficient optimization algorithm that reconstructs expression dynamics and infers GRNs from differentiating cells by integrating linear ODE transformations and linear regression, demonstrating significant efficiency and accuracy [2]. Furthermore, sophisticated non‐linear dynamic models, like those based on network control theory and the Waddington landscape concept, have been developed to model cell fate dynamics at the gene level, viewing cell fates as attractors determined by gene interactions [24]. Despite their strengths in capturing dynamics and stochasticity, dynamic systems models, including ODEs, face significant limitations [1]. They often demand substantial input data and computational resources, which restricts their applicability to smaller networks or a limited number of TFs and targets [9]. ODE models, in particular, tend to become computationally infeasible as the size of the network increases [28]. Moreover, the complexity of larger networks and the reliance on prior domain‐specific knowledge pose scalability challenges and can introduce publication bias [1]. These factors represent considerable challenges in the comprehensive modeling of dynamic GRNs [15].​  

# 3.6 Machine Learning-based Methods (including Deep Learning)  

Machine learning (ML) methods, particularly deep learning (DL), have garnered significant attention in bioinformatics due to their ability to learn complex patterns from data, making them promising tools for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference [9]. These methods learn GRN structures or regulatory relationships by training on diverse biological datasets—such as gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and genomic sequences [24,29,31]. For instance, LINGER employs a neural network model trained on single-cell paired gene expression and chromatin accessibility data to predict target gene expression based on transcription factor (TF) expression and regulatory element (RE) accessibility [29]. Similarly, CEFCON utilizes a graph attention neural network within a contrastive learning framework, training the network by maximizing the mutual information between node features and graph-level representations to construct cell-lineage-specific GRNs [24]. Other ML approaches include regularized linear models used by CellOracle, which infer GRNs and can refine connections based on certainty using Bayesian or bagging strategies [25], as well as unsupervised methods like self-organizing maps (SOM)—a type of artificial neural network—used for mapping genes [12]. Although these methods offer flexibility in modeling various types of regulatory interactions and can achieve high accuracy in predicting regulatory links, they are susceptible to overfitting, especially with limited data. They also often suffer from a lack of interpretability, making it challenging to understand the learned regulatory logic [24,29,31].​  

Comparing deep learning methods to more traditional ML approaches reveals distinct advantages and disadvantages [2]. Deep learning models, built upon artificial neural networks with multiple layers, are inherently capable of capturing intricate, non-linear relationships within high-dimensional biological data that traditional methods might miss [9,18]. For example, GRINCD leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate gene representations, specifically considering both linear and non-linear regulatory relationships through causal asymmetric learning [13]. CEFCON also employs a graph attention neural network, highlighting the utility of GNNs in modeling relationships within network structures [24]. Supervised deep learning approaches, such as the co-expression convolutional neural network (CNNC), are trained on labeled data like known TF–target pairs to predict targets and identify disease-related genes, demonstrating their taskspecific predictive power [2]. Furthermore, deep learning architectures like GNNs are being explored for applications such as filling gaps in metabolic networks by learning topological relationships, indicating their capacity to handle complex biological graph data [5].​  

A specific example of a deep learning approach for GRN inference is ForgeNet, which employs a deep feedforward network, potentially embedded with a forest graph structure, to aid feature selection and inference [18]. As a supervised method, ForgeNet requires labeled training data [18]. This requirement underscores a significant challenge in applying deep learning to GRN inference: the substantial need for large, high-quality labeled datasets to effectively train complex models and prevent overfitting. Another major challenge is the interpretability of these complex models; while they serve as powerful predictors, understanding the precise rules or features that drive their inferences about regulatory connections remains difficult, posing limitations for biological discovery and validation [18]. This lack of transparency in model parameters and predictions can hinder drawing definitive causal inferences about regulatory relationships [33]. Despite these challenges, the capacity of deep learning to model complex, non-linear interactions and handle high-dimensional multi-omics data makes it a continually evolving and promising area for deciphering gene regulatory networks.  

# 3.7 Sparse Graph Methods (e.g., Graphical Lasso, Markov Networks, DAGs)  

Sparse graph recovery models constitute a class of methods employed for the inference of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) [15]. These approaches typically involve representing the network as a graph and inferring the edges by imposing sparsity constraints, which aids in identifying direct regulatory interactions [15]. Within this domain, methods are commonly categorized into frameworks such as Graphical Lasso, Markov Networks, and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) [15].  

Graphical Lasso is utilized for GRN inference, with discussions focusing on its benefits and drawbacks in this application context [15]. A key aspect highlighted is how the inherent sparsity constraint within the Graphical Lasso framework contributes to the identification of direct regulatory relationships between genes [15].  

Markov Networks represent another class of methods applied to GRN inference. Their strengths and weaknesses in modeling gene interactions within a network context are subject to evaluation [15].  

Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are also employed in sparse graph methods for GRN inference. DAGs are instrumental in representing the directionality of regulatory relationships, which is crucial for understanding causal influences within the network [15]. However, challenges exist in learning DAG structures from observational data, particularly in accurately capturing and representing feedback loops, which inherently violate the acyclic assumption of DAGs [15]. These challenges underscore the complexities involved in inferring causal structures from static or time-series transcriptomic data using DAGbased models.​  

# 4. Single-Cell Specific GRN Inference Methods  

The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of gene regulation, enabling the inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) at single-cell resolution [2,3,7,9,17,21]. Unlike bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq captures the transcriptional landscape of individual cells, revealing cellular heterogeneity and dynamic processes [14,17]. However, scRNA-seq data presents unique computational challenges, including high dimensionality, sparsity (dropout events), and technical noise, which necessitate the development of specialized GRN inference methods [8,9,22].  

A variety of methods have been developed to address these challenges and leverage the power of single-cell data to infer cell-type-specific GRNs and identify dynamic cellular states [3,7,8,17]. These approaches span various computational paradigms, including regression-based, information theory-based, dynamic systems, co-expression analysis, and deep learning [1,18,24,29].​  

One prominent approach is the SCENIC workflow, specifically designed for single-cell transcriptomics data to infer GRNs and identify cell types and states [4,8,10]. SCENIC focuses on identifying transcription factors (TFs) and their core regulons by combining TF-gene co-expression analysis with sequence-based validation using cis-regulatory motif enrichment [7,8,10,12]. By assessing the activity of these regulons in individual cells using algorithms like AUCell, SCENIC effectively handles gene dropouts and provides a measure of regulon activity per cell, enabling the identification of cell population types and states based on their regulatory profiles. This allows for the inference of cell-type-specific GRNs represented by active regulons within those cell types [7].  

Another method, hdWGCNA, extends the principles of Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to address the challenges of high-dimensional and sparse single-cell data [22]. A key strategy employed by hdWGCNA is the construction of metacells by aggregating transcriptionally similar cells [22]. This preprocessing step reduces data sparsity and noise, improving the reliability of downstream co-expression calculations. hdWGCNA identifies modules of coexpressed genes, often specific to certain cell types or states [22]. Cell-type specificity is then assessed through differential module eigengene analysis, which compares module activity across predefined cell populations. This method provides insights into cell-type-specific co-expression networks and potential regulatory mechanisms driving cellular identity.  

Beyond SCENIC and hdWGCNA, other methods offer distinct approaches. The cell-specific network (CSN) and conditional cell-specific network (CCSN) methods construct networks for each individual cell, aiming to capture network heterogeneity at the single-cell level by considering statistical and partial independence [2]. Methods like CellOracle divide scRNA-seq data into clusters to facilitate linear model fitting for regulatory inference [25]. Some tools, including SINCERA and ACTION, incorporate steps to identify key regulators of cell-type-specific characteristics [9]. Dynamic systems approaches like SCODE, or methods like LEAP and SINCERITIES utilizing pseudotime ordering, infer directionality and capture dynamic changes in GRNs during developmental processes or state transitions [1,3,7]. Graph neural networks are also being applied, as seen in CEFCON, which considers both TFs and non-TFs and employs attention mechanisms to capture gene relationships [24]. Furthermore, integrating information from multiple single-cell modalities, such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, is gaining prominence, with methods like CellOracle, MICA, and IReNA employing multi-stage or integrative approaches to build more comprehensive GRNs [1]. Methods like PIDC and DeepTFni specifically focus on inferring _trans_-regulation from scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq data, respectively [1,29].  

In summary, single-cell specific GRN inference methods employ diverse computational strategies to overcome the inherent challenges of scRNA-seq data, enabling the detailed exploration of gene regulation at the single-cell level. By inferring celltype-specific GRNs and characterizing dynamic regulatory shifts, these methods provide crucial insights into cellular identity, state transitions, and heterogeneity [2,3]. The ongoing development of these techniques, including multi-modal integration, continues to enhance our ability to decipher the complex regulatory landscapes governing cellular function.  

# 4.1 SCENIC Workflow  

The SCENIC (Single-CEll regulatory Network Inference and Clustering) workflow is a widely adopted computational method for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and identifying key transcription factors (TFs) and their regulons from singlecell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data [4,8,10,16].  

![](images/8d8fe99dad87c8dacb57b7ef0113bf07b854d483253cf8796cb8d749d28a9ff0.jpg)  

The workflow typically involves three core steps aimed at identifying cell-type-specific GRNs [7]:  

1. Co-expression Network Inference: This initial step identifies modules of genes co-expressed with TFs [4,8,10]. Algorithms such as GENIE3 or GRNBoost/GRNBoost2 are commonly employed for this purpose, with frameworks like Arboreto providing scalable implementations [4,8,10,31]. This step generates a preliminary network based on statistical dependencies between TF and target gene expression levels [7,12].  

2. Cis-Regulatory Motif Analysis: This is a critical step that distinguishes SCENIC from methods relying solely on coexpression [8]. Using tools like RcisTarget, the workflow refines the inferred co-expression modules by incorporating information about TF binding motifs [4,8,10]. Each co-expression module is subjected to cis-regulatory motif analysis to identify putative direct-binding targets based on the enrichment of TF binding motifs in the promoter regions or surrounding regulatory elements of candidate target genes [4,7,10]. Modules exhibiting significant motif enrichment for the corresponding upstream regulator are retained and subsequently pruned to remove indirect targets lacking motif support. These refined modules, consisting of a TF and its potential direct target genes, are termed regulons [8,10]. This integration of motif analysis is crucial for verifying the statistically inferred gene co-expression network and identifying highly reliable, TF-dominated GRNs [12]. Variants like SCENIC+ leverage extensive motif atlases, potentially capturing a broader range of TFs and offering distinct advantages in predicting TF binding sites [1].​  

3. Regulon Activity Scoring: The final step assesses the activity of each identified regulon in individual cells using the AUCell algorithm [4,8,10]. AUCell calculates an enrichment score for each regulon within the gene expression profile of each cell, providing a measure of the regulon's activity [4]. This results in a regulon activity matrix, which can be subsequently binarized to determine whether a regulon is considered "on" or "off" in specific cells [8]. This cell-specific activity information is invaluable for downstream analyses, such as clustering cells based on regulatory states and identifying key TFs driving cell type identity or state transitions [10,17]. pySCENIC is a Python implementation of this pipeline, enabling rapid inference of TFs, GRNs, and cell types from scRNA-seq data [31].  

The primary strength of the SCENIC workflow lies in its robust approach to identifying key TFs and their direct target genes by combining co-expression analysis with sequence-based motif validation, thereby filtering out potentially indirect interactions and enhancing the reliability of predicted GRN edges [4,7,8,10,12]. The reliance on motif databases, however, represents a potential limitation. The accuracy and completeness of the predicted regulons are highly dependent on the quality and coverage of the motif databases used [4]. Furthermore, SCENIC may potentially miss novel regulatory interactions that do not involve known TF binding motifs or occur through alternative mechanisms lacking canonical motif signatures. Despite these considerations, SCENIC remains a foundational method for inferring transcriptionally regulated networks at single-cell resolution.​  

# 4.2 hdWGCNA for Single-Cell Data  

Analyzing gene co-expression networks in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data presents unique challenges, primarily due to high dimensionality and data sparsity. Standard Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) is less effective in this context. The hdWGCNA method extends the principles of WGCNA to address these challenges, offering a more robust framework for single-cell data [22].  

A key innovation in hdWGCNA is the incorporation of metacell construction [22]. This preprocessing step involves aggregating transcriptionally similar cells into "metacells" using algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) [22]. By averaging expression profiles within these groups, metacells effectively reduce the inherent sparsity of scRNA-seq data, which consists of numerous zero counts for many genes in individual cells [22]. This reduction in sparsity significantly improves the reliability and robustness of subsequent gene-gene correlation calculations and co-expression network construction compared to analyzing individual cells directly [22]. While aggregating cells might seem to reduce resolution, the metacell approach is designed to retain key information and capture representative expression patterns from the original samples, contributing to improved accuracy in identifying true co-expression relationships [22].  

Following metacell construction and standard data preprocessing steps like normalization and batch effect correction, hdWGCNA proceeds similarly to WGCNA, involving gene-gene correlation calculation with soft-thresholding for robustness, calculation of the Topological Overlap Matrix (TOM) to quantify network connectivity, and unsupervised clustering (e.g., Dynamic Tree Cut) on the TOM to identify co-expressed gene modules [22]. Each identified module represents a set of genes hypothesized to be co-regulated or involved in similar biological processes, often specific to certain cell types or states [22].  

A crucial aspect of hdWGCNA for single-cell analysis is the ability to identify cell-type-specific gene modules and regulatory relationships [22]. This is largely facilitated by subsequent analyses focusing on how these modules behave across different cellular populations. For each identified module, a module eigengene (ME) is calculated as the first principal component of the expression matrix for the genes within that module [22]. The ME serves as a representative expression profile for the entire module. The Differential Module Eigengene (DME) analysis then assesses significant differences in ME values between predefined cell types or conditions [22]. The utility of DME analysis lies precisely in its ability to pinpoint modules whose activity patterns are uniquely enriched or depressed in specific cell populations, thereby highlighting celltype-specific co-expression networks and offering insights into cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms [22].  

Downstream functional analysis, such as gene enrichment analysis performed on the genes within these cell-type-specific modules, helps elucidate their biological roles [22]. Furthermore, the identification of core genes (hub genes) within modules, defined by their high network connectivity, can point to key regulators or central players within these cell-typespecific networks [22]. Network visualization and differential expression analysis of MEs further aid in interpreting the complex relationships and module specificities identified by hdWGCNA in single-cell datasets [22].  

# 5. Integrating Multi-omics Data for Enhanced GRN Inference  

The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is fundamentally enhanced by the integration of multi-omics data, moving beyond the reliance solely on transcriptomics [3,7,9]. While gene expression data provides crucial insights into the output of regulatory processes, integrating orthogonal data types offers a more comprehensive view of cellular regulatory states and the intricate interactions between different molecular layers [7,9]. For instance, incorporating data on chromatin accessibility (e.g., scATAC-seq) or transcription factor (TF) binding (e.g., ChIP-seq) provides direct evidence of potential regulatory elements (REs) and TF-DNA interactions, which are upstream determinants of transcription [3,7,16]. This complementary information, such as linking genome variation with changes in the epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and phenome, significantly refines GRN structures by identifying relevant regulatory interactions and improving the accuracy of inference [7,31]. Multi-omics approaches, including the integration of data from measurements of chromatin activity and gene expression, offer unparalleled definition and help to overcome limitations inherent in methods based on a single omic layer [3,7,14]. Furthermore, integrating data types such as metabolomics and proteomics can contribute to building more accurate, condition-specific biological network models [5].​  

Different strategies exist for integrating multi-omics data with transcriptomics for GRN inference. A primary consideration is whether the multi-omics data are collected from the same cells (paired data) or different cells (unpaired data) [7]. Paired multi-omics data, such as combined scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements from the same cell, offer the most direct way to link regulatory potential with transcriptional outcome [7,29]. However, obtaining paired data at scale remains challenging. Consequently, methods have been developed to integrate unpaired multi-omics data [1,29]. These strategies include aggregating reads or profiles from groups of cells or independently constructing GRNs from each modality before merging them [3,7]. Other methods model the different modalities simultaneously, even if unpaired, by employing computational integration techniques to match cells or features across datasets [3,7]. Specific approaches include simple concatenation of data from different modalities [12] or more complex techniques such as projecting data into lowdimensional representations using matrix factorization (e.g., DC3, scREG, scAI) or deep learning-based autoencoders (e.g., GLUE, scTIE) to learn shared patterns [1]. These integrated low-dimensional embeddings are then used to extract multiomics features for inferring interactions, such as those between accessible cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and target genes [1,3,7]. Advantages of multi-omics integration include improved accuracy, the ability to predict gene expression from TF expression and assign TFs to accessible CREs using binding motif information, and linking CREs to target genes, often constrained by genomic distance, though the choice of distance cutoff can affect results [3,7]. Integrating sequence analysis data can also help assess the causality of regulatory interactions [6].​  

Despite the significant benefits, integrating different data types presents challenges, including data heterogeneity, scale, noise, and the need for robust computational methods that can effectively model the complex relationships between different omic layers [1,3]. A range of multi-modal integration methods have been developed specifically for this purpose. Methods like DeepMAPS, FigR, GLUE, scAI, and SOMatic implement diverse integration strategies to facilitate multi-modal GRN inference [3]. GLUE and scAI, for instance, utilize advanced computational techniques, such as deep learning or matrix factorization, to project different modalities into common low-dimensional spaces [1]. LINGER integrates single-cell paired data with external atlas-scale bulk data to improve atlas-scale GRN inference [29]. Other methods like CEFCON also contribute to the field of multi-modal network analysis [24]. These methods vary in their computational complexity,  

assumptions about data relationships, and suitability for different types of input data (paired vs. unpaired, specific omics combinations), necessitating careful consideration when choosing an appropriate tool for a given research question. The development and application of such methods are paving the way for next-generation GRN inference algorithms applicable across various fields, including developmental and evolutionary biology [2].​  

# 5.1 Incorporating TF Binding and Chromatin Accessibility Data  

The inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) traditionally relies heavily on gene expression data. However, transcription factor (TF) binding and chromatin accessibility data offer crucial orthogonal information that can significantly refine GRN structures by providing more direct evidence of regulatory interactions and identifying relevant regulatory elements [3,7].​  

Direct measurement of TF binding sites provides compelling evidence for potential regulatory interactions. Techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) enable the precise detection of genomic locations where TFs bind [7]. This information can be directly leveraged in GRN construction by linking TF binding sites to nearby or associated genes, thereby identifying potential direct TF-target gene interactions [3,7]. While TF binding data offers specificity regarding whichTF may interact with the genome at a given location, using this data alone for GRN inference has limitations. TF binding does not universally equate to active regulation; binding events can be non-productive or context-dependent. Furthermore, these methods, especially in their earlier forms, were often applied in bulk cell populations, obscuring cell-type-specific or dynamic regulatory events.  

Chromatin accessibility data complements TF binding data by revealing the general epigenetic state of the genome, indicating regions that are potentially available for regulatory protein binding and transcription. Technologies such as DNase-seq and NOME-seq detect open chromatin regions, with ATAC-seq becoming the mainstream due to its operational simplicity and lower cost [7]. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) further advances this by providing accessibility profiles at single-cell resolution [12,14,31], capturing cellular heterogeneity in regulatory landscapes. scATAC-seq can be performed using various experimental methods, including microfluidic platforms and combinatorial cellular indexing (sciATAC-seq), offering trade-offs between reads per cell and throughput [9].  

![](images/ae83c3f38943cc1fa26a000094dcb9d96847282b285f5f726d88a2faed42f63c.jpg)  

Chromatin accessibility data significantly improves GRN inference in several ways [3,7,9,29]: it identifies potential regulatory elements (REs), including proximal promoters and distal enhancers, by detecting accessible genomic regions [25,29]. These accessible regions are often associated with gene transcription activity [12]. Importantly, accessibility data enables the linkage of identified REs to their potential target genes [3,7,9,29]. Moreover, by scanning the DNA sequence within these accessible regulatory elements for known TF-binding motifs, researchers can generate a "base GRN structure" representing all potential regulatory interactions based on accessibility and sequence context [25,29]. This motif-based approach within accessible regions provides hypotheses for TF-RE interactions even without direct TF binding data for every factor. Therefore, chromatin accessibility data is critical for mapping the landscape of active regulatory regions and linking these regions to the genes they likely control, complementing the direct interaction evidence provided by TF binding data.  

# 6. Causal Inference in GRNs  

Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from the perspective of causality is crucial for elucidating the dynamic mechanisms underlying cellular systems [13]. A fundamental challenge in GRN inference is moving beyond mere correlation to establish true causal relationships among system components [13]. Observational transcriptomics data, while abundant, primarily captures associations (correlations) between gene expression levels. Methods based purely on correlation or linear regression struggle to distinguish direct regulatory effects from indirect associations or confounding factors, thus failing to reliably infer causal links.​  

To address the limitations of observational data, perturbation analysis plays a critical role in validating and inferring causal relationships in GRNs [9]. Experimental methods provide a more direct avenue for inference by specifically perturbing regulators and observing the resulting changes in the expression levels of their potential target genes over time [1]. Modern single-cell technologies, particularly those leveraging CRISPR-based techniques such as CRISP-seq, Perturb-seq, CROP-seq, and Mosaic-seq, enable targeted genetic perturbations within cell populations, with the transcriptional consequences measured by single-cell transcriptomics [9]. This allows researchers to directly assay the impact of altering a specific gene on the expression of others, providing strong evidence for causality. Furthermore, integrating multiple data modalities that capture different facets of gene regulation, such as chromatin accessibility and conformation, can bolster confidence in inferred regulatory connections [1]. For example, the physical proximity indicated by chromatin loops between a transcription factor (TF) binding site and a target gene suggests a plausible regulatory mechanism beyond simple coexpression [1]. Time-series experiments also offer a direct approach by capturing dynamic changes necessary for inferring directional regulatory effects [1,6].​  

Beyond experimental approaches, in silico perturbation strategies offer a complementary computational means to simulate and analyze the effects of gene perturbations. Tools like CellOracle implement such strategies to simulate how perturbing a TF might alter cell identity [25]. Using a learned GRN model, CellOracle calculates the expected shifts in target gene expression following a TF perturbation [25]. This process models the GRN's function in propagating a signal (the expression shift) from the TF to its targets, rather than merely using absolute expression values [25]. By iteratively propagating this signal through the network, the method estimates the broad, downstream transcriptional impact of the initial perturbation, providing insights into potential causal cascades [25].​  

Various causal inference algorithms have been developed and applied to transcriptomics data. Granger Causality (GC), often applied to time-series data, is based on the principle that a cause must temporally precede its effect [28]. In the context of GRNs, GC posits that gene X Granger-causes gene Y if including the past values of X improves the accuracy of an autoregressive model predicting Y, compared to using only the past values of Y [28]. Other approaches include methods based on additive noise models (ANM), such as GRINCD, which aims to predict causal regulation for regulator-target pairs [13]. More broadly, frameworks like structural causal models formalize interventions and their effects on biological networks [33]. Machine learning is also being explored for causal discovery, with meta-learning showing promise in learning conditional probability functions, and specific algorithm reformulations like Causal KNN, Causal SVM, and Causal RF being adapted for this purpose [33]. Furthermore, integrating diverse data types, such as sequence analysis with results from time series and mutant experiments, is a strategy used to assess the causality of regulatory interactions [6]. These algorithmic and integrated approaches are essential for moving towards a more accurate and mechanistic understanding of gene regulation.​  

# 7. Validation and Assessment of GRN Inference Methods  

The accurate reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is paramount for deciphering the complex molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes. Given that the objective of reconstructed GRNs is to faithfully reproduce biological phenomena of interest, rigorous validation protocols are indispensable for evaluating the reliability and performance of inference methods [1,30]. Validation serves to quantify the consistency between the inferred network and the actual cellular regulatory landscape, often referred to as the "ground truth" [1].​  

Despite its critical importance, GRN validation remains a significant and unresolved challenge [1]. A primary difficulty, particularly in supervised inference approaches which rely on machine learning, lies in achieving reliable insilicovalidation when the prediction and validation processes utilize the same partially known network [30]. Evaluating the accuracy of GRN inference is inherently challenging due to the incomplete nature of existing knowledge about true regulatory interactions.  

Establishing a credible "ground truth" is essential for rigorous validation [1]. Experimentally verified regulatory interactions derived from wet-lab methods provide the most reliable source of ground truth [9]. Functional perturbation experiments, such as loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies, are commonly employed to validate regulatory connections by observing phenotypic or molecular changes upon perturbing regulator expression [1]. The advent of high-throughput technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 has dramatically increased the efficiency and scale at which such interactions can be screened and validated [9]. Beyond direct perturbation, datasets like ChIP-seq are also utilized to generate comprehensive transcriptional ground-truth networks for benchmarking inference methods [25,29]. In the absence of extensive  

experimental data, simulated datasets with known network topology serve as valuable tools for benchmarking accuracy, as the true structure is defined apriori[6,28].  

The choice of validation metric significantly influences the perceived performance of GRN inference methods [30]. Network inference is fundamentally a binary classification problem, where the task is to classify pairs of genes as either interacting (positive) or non-interacting (negative). Common criteria for evaluating binary predictions include accuracy or error rate [27,30]. However, GRN inference problems are characterized by a severe class imbalance, as the number of non-interacting pairs vastly outweighs the number of interacting pairs among all possible gene pairs [30]. In such scenarios, simple accuracy metrics are inappropriate because they disproportionately favor the majority (negative) class, leading to an overestimation of performance [30].​  

More informative metrics differentiating between types of errors are derived from a confusion matrix, which tabulates true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN) [27,30].  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Metric</td><td>Formula</td><td>Description / Use Case</td><td>Relevance for GRN Inference</td></tr><tr><td>Accuracy</td><td>(TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+ FN)</td><td>Overall correctness.

From this matrix, key performance indicators can be calculated, including:  

True Positive Rate (TPR) or Recall or Sensitivity: ​ TP + FN ​   
True Negative Rate (TNR) or Specificity: $\frac { T N } { F P + T N }$   
False Positive Rate (FPR) or 1-Specificity: $\frac { F P } { F P + T N }$   
False Negative Rate (FNR) or Miss: ​TP + FN ​   
Precision: ​TP + FP ​   
F-score, the harmonic mean of precision and recall: ​F = $F = { \frac { 2 \cdot { \mathrm { p r e c i s i o n } } \cdot { \mathrm { r e c a l l } } } { { \mathrm { p r e c i s i o n } } + { \mathrm { r e c a l l } } } }$ [27,30].  

These individual metrics are often combined to provide a comprehensive view of performance, such as using sensitivity alongside specificity, or precision alongside recall [30]. Graphical tools like Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, which plot TPR against FPR across varying confidence thresholds, are widely used [18,30]. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) summarizes performance, with 1 indicating a perfect classifier and $0 . 5 \mathsf { a }$ random one [25,29,30]. Another valuable visualization is the Precision-Recall (PR) curve, which plots precision against recall (TPR) [30]. The Area Under the PR Curve (AUPR) or AUPRC [24,29] is particularly informative for imbalanced datasets because, unlike ROC curves which are less sensitive to class ratio, PR curves are directly affected by imbalance, making them a preferred metric for highly sparse biological networks where the proportion of positive interactions is low [30]. Other metrics such as the Early Precision Ratio (EPR) and the precision of the top- $\cdot \boldsymbol { \mathsf { k } }$ predictions are also employed, especially when focusing on identifying key regulators [24]. Different methods may demonstrate optimal performance across varying evaluation metrics or datasets [13].​  

Accounting for network topology is crucial in validation studies [30]. The structural properties of the true network, such as connectivity patterns and the presence of hubs, can significantly impact inference difficulty and the interpretation of validation results. The availability of negative examples (experimentally verified non-interacting pairs) is a critical limitation [30]. Since such empirical data is scarce, validation studies often face challenges in reliably assessing false positives. Strategies for generating pseudo-negative examples are necessary to mitigate this issue and provide a more robust evaluation framework [30].​  

Cross-validation techniques are commonly employed to assess the generalization performance of models. For GRN inference, which involves classification on pairs of objects, standard cross-validation procedures must be adapted [30]. While the adaptation is noted as essential, a detailed analysis of the specific advantages and disadvantages of different adapted cross-validation techniques for GRN inference is not extensively covered. Beyond accuracy metrics, robustness assessments, such as evaluating performance with varying data subsets or sequencing depth, are also vital for understanding method reliability [8]. Furthermore, factors like network size and the inclusion of mutants can influence the performance of inference algorithms [6].  

# 8. Applications of GRN Inference  

Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference serves as a powerful computational approach for elucidating the complex regulatory mechanisms that govern cellular processes. These networks provide a systems-level view of how transcription factors and other regulatory molecules interact to control gene expression, thereby orchestrating diverse biological functions. The application of GRN inference has become essential for addressing fundamental questions in biology and holds significant promise in translational research.  

A primary area of application is the study of cell identity, differentiation, and developmental processes [2,7,9,21]. GRNs are fundamental determinants of cell state and lineage commitment. By inferring and analyzing GRNs, researchers can dissect the molecular programs that specify distinct cell identities, understand the regulatory shifts accompanying cellular differentiation, and map the complex trajectories of development [2,9,16,21]. The integration of single-cell transcriptomics data has been particularly transformative, enabling the exploration of cellular heterogeneity and dynamic regulatory changes at unprecedented resolution [2,9,21].​  

Beyond fundamental biology, GRN inference plays a critical role in understanding disease mechanisms [2,3,7,9,12,13,14,21]. GRNs can reveal the perturbed regulatory circuits that drive pathological states, providing insights into the underlying molecular basis of diseases such as type 2 diabetes [14], inflammation-induced cancer progression [13], and the complexity of tumor heterogeneity [8,21]. This mechanistic understanding is crucial for identifying potential drug targets [2,7,13,21] and predicting patient response to therapies [12,33].  

The analysis of GRNs also extends to applying network control theory, particularly relevant in the context of tumor heterogeneity and personalized genomics [24,26]. By applying principles from control theory, researchers can identify key driver genes or regulatory nodes within personalized networks that, when targeted, might steer the system towards a desired state, such as reversing a disease phenotype [24,26]. This framework supports the development of personalized drug combination strategies aimed at disrupting specific disease-driving networks [26,33].​  

In essence, the applications of GRN inference significantly enhance our understanding of complex biological systems by providing a network-centric perspective on gene regulation [2,3,7,9,12,13,14,21]. This enables the identification of key regulatory components and pathways involved in both normal biological processes and disease states, paving the way for novel diagnostics and therapeutics.​  

# 8.1 GRNs in Cell Identity, Differentiation, and Development  

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) play a fundamental role in orchestrating the complex processes of cell identity specification, differentiation, and development. Single‐cell transcriptomics coupled with advanced GRN inference methods has emerged as a powerful approach to dissecting the underlying regulatory mechanisms, particularly in understanding cellular heterogeneity and mapping developmental trajectories [2,21].​  

GRN analysis contributes significantly to understanding developmental processes by revealing the intricate transcriptional control mechanisms driving cell fate decisions. For example, studies investigating lateral root initiation in Arabidopsis thaliana illustrate the application of GRN inference in plant development [6]. Similarly, researchers have utilized GRN approaches to unravel genomic regulatory "recipes" controlling cell fate decisions, such as photoreceptor specification and differentiation during Drosophila eye-antennal disc development [31]. The differentiation of murine T helper 17 (Th17) cells has also been elucidated using GRN inference, highlighting regulatory mechanisms in immune cell development [28].  

GRNs are critical determinants of cell identity and contribute substantially to cellular heterogeneity within tissues or during developmental stages. The state of a cell's regulatory network defines its identity, and variations in these networks across a population give rise to heterogeneity. Tools like SCENIC demonstrate this by effectively grouping cells into distinct types based on network activity scores, showing robustness even across species and different technical platforms [8]. The CellOracle framework further exemplifies this by recapitulating well-known cell fate regulation governed by transcription factors (TFs) in haematopoiesis and recovering known and putative regulators of cell identity during zebrafish development [25]. For instance, CellOracle studies predicted and validated the role of noto in prechordal plate development and lhx1a in axial mesoderm development, demonstrating how specific TFs within the GRN define regional cell identities [25]. During the differentiation of mouse hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into erythroid, granulocyte-monocyte, and lymphoid lineages, method CEFCON identified common and lineage-specific driver regulators (e.g., Klf1 for erythroid, Mpo for granulocytemonocyte, and Mef2c for lymphoid), underscoring how distinct regulatory nodes drive the emergence of different cell identities from a common progenitor [24].​  

Cell differentiation is characterized by dynamic changes in GRNs as cells progress through different states and acquire specific fates. GRN analysis, particularly using single‐cell transcriptomics, allows researchers to trace these changes along developmental trajectories. For example, diffusion maps combined with Boolean network construction have been used to model the developmental trajectory of mouse mesoderm to blood, predicting and experimentally confirming the activation of genes like Erg by upstream regulators such as Sox17 or Hoxb4 [2]. Similarly, studies have constructed GRNs to illustrate the differences between fetal and adult thymus cells and establish a differentiation map for γδT cells, revealing the regulatory shifts occurring over time and lineage progression [2]. Differential expression gene networks have also been applied to characterize distinct stages of γδT cell differentiation [2]. The identification of the Ddit3-Gata2 regulatory axis in erythroid lineage programming demonstrates how specific interactions within the GRN change to promote one fate (erythroid) while antagonizing another (myeloid) [2]. Analyzing dynamic GRNs during differentiation often utilizes timeseries transcriptomics data, which captures the temporal progression of gene expression changes [25]. Methods like Continuous Time Bayesian Networks (CTBNs) are specifically designed to model these dynamic regulatory mechanisms, as applied to understanding Th17 cell differentiation [28]. The study of ILC development also utilized GRN analysis to identify TCF-1 target genes, highlighting regulators involved in the progression of ILC precursors [2]. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the capacity of GRN inference to reveal the dynamic regulatory landscape that underpins cellular differentiation and development.​  

# 8.2 GRNs in Disease Modeling and Drug Discovery  

Gene regulatory network (GRN) analysis serves as a crucial tool in deciphering the intricate mechanisms underlying various diseases and identifying potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. Beyond merely cataloging differential gene expression, GRNs provide a systems-level perspective, illuminating the complex interplay between regulatory elements and target genes that drive pathological states. For instance, GRN analysis has been specifically applied to identify mechanisms of beta cell dysfunction, a key contributor to type 2 diabetes, thereby facilitating the discovery of relevant drug targets and a deeper understanding of the disease pathology [14]. More broadly, GRNs aid in identifying key regulatory genes and pathways involved in disease progression, which can further assist in predicting patient response to specific drugs and anticipating the development of drug resistance [12]. For example, computational methods like GRINCD have been developed to identify crucial potential regulators that orchestrate the transition from inflammatory conditions to malignant states, such as the progression from colon inflammation to colon cancer [13]. Similarly, reconstructing metabolic network models, such as patient-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), has proven valuable in predicting the efficacy of metabolic inhibitors, suggesting potential targets for precision treatment of HCC [5]. GEMs have also been utilized to understand molecular drivers in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [5]. Co-expression network analysis can identify critical genes in specific disease stages, such as the early phase of fulminant hepatitis in a mouse model, pointing towards genes potentially serving as diagnostic markers [19]. Furthermore, GRNs contribute to identifying disease biomarkers and elucidating the underlying causal pathways of diseases like cancer [33]. The inference of atlas-scale GRNs can enhance the interpretation of disease-associated genetic variants and genes discovered through genome-wide association studies, providing insight into their complex regulatory landscape [29].  

The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized the study of GRNs in disease by enabling the dissection of cellular heterogeneity within complex tissues. Single-cell GRN inference methods are specifically employed to investigate disease mechanisms at single-cell resolution [2,7,21]. This granular approach can facilitate the discovery of novel cell types from a network perspective and reveal "dark" genes—those playing significant regulatory roles within the network but often overlooked by traditional bulk differential expression analysis [2]. A prominent application is the use of scRNA-seq data to construct GRNs in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to systematically dissect intratumoral heterogeneity and identify key regulatory genes [21]. For instance, analysis in TNBC identified ETV6 as a potential drug target, as its activation across five molecular subtypes (excluding normal epithelial cells) may promote intratumoral heterogeneity by regulating numerous genes [21]. In melanoma, single-cell GRN analysis using methods like SCENIC has identified transcription factors such as NFATC2 and NFIB associated with states linked to melanoma dedifferentiation, immune escape, and stem cell characteristics [8]. Immunohistochemical validation in melanoma specimens revealed high expression of NFIB and NFATC2 in sentinel lymph nodes, co-localizing with ZEB1, suggesting their involvement in early metastatic events [8]. Functional studies, such as NFATC2 knockdown in melanoma cells, demonstrated significant upregulation of genes in its regulon and genes related to cell adhesion, extracellular matrix, and invasion, underscoring NFATC2's role in disease progression [8]. Understanding gene regulation in cancer also involves identifying cis-regulatory driver mutations that disrupt enhancer function and perturb GRNs, recognizing that changes in expression profiles during progression contribute to regulatory heterogeneity and impact therapy response [31].  

Network control theory provides a framework for analyzing GRNs to identify key driver genes, particularly relevant in the context of tumor heterogeneity and personalized genomics [24,26]. By applying network control tools, researchers can identify specific driver genes within personalized networks, unique to individual patients [26]. This patient-specific approach allows for the design of personalized drug combination prediction models. These models aim to identify synergistic drug combinations tailored to target the identified personalized driver genes, offering a more precise strategy for drug discovery and treatment [26].

The inference and application of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) from transcriptomic data, particularly single-cell transcriptomics, face several significant challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize their potential in biology and medicine [1,2,3,7,9].​  

A primary hurdle is the inherent characteristic and quality of single-cell data. Single-cell RNA sequencing data is often characterized by substantial sparsity and noise compared to bulk data, which stems partly from technical factors such as inefficient library preparation and sequence amplification [1,2,7]. This low data quality and noise pose challenges for  

constructing robust and accurate GRNs [1,2]. Furthermore, stochastic variation in gene expression, including transcriptional bursting, can lead to a partial decoupling of gene expression levels from the dynamics of transcription factor (TF) inputs at the single-cell level, complicating inference [10]. Batch effects and sample heterogeneity can also introduce variability that affects network inference, potentially leading to deviations from scale-free network properties if not properly handled [32].  

Computational challenges are prominent, especially when dealing with high-dimensional single-cell datasets [3,15]. The reconstruction of GRNs, particularly using methods like Bayesian networks, is an NP-hard problem with respect to the number of genes, making exact structure learning computationally intractable for large networks [27]. Heuristic approaches are often necessary for large-scale networks, but they may waste time examining unreasonable candidates [27]. Specific methods like SCENIC can be computationally intensive for large datasets [4]. Learning complex regulatory mechanisms from limited data points also presents a significant computational challenge [29]. While deep learning approaches hold promise, their application to GRN recovery is still limited [15], and many current deep learning models suffer from a "black box" nature, restricting the interpretability of the underlying gene-regulatory mechanisms [25]. Methods for causal inference using machine learning also face limitations in generalization and incorporating crucial information like interventions, domain shifts, and temporal structure [33]. Furthermore, current methods often assume synchronous evolution from "snapshot-like" data, which may not accurately reflect continuous biological processes, especially with unevenly spaced time-course data [28].  

Integrating diverse types of omics data (multi-omics), such as epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and spatial data, is crucial for comprehensive GRN reconstruction but presents complex challenges [3,7,15,24]. Different omics layers have varying dynamic characteristics, leading to potential time discrepancies that complicate integration [7]. The assumption that paired data at a single time point represents interaction may be insufficient [7]. Insufficient data integration can mislead GRN construction [7]. Specific data types, like scATAC-seq, are often treated as binary due to sparsity, potentially neglecting the dynamic, quantitative nature of chromatin accessibility and adversely affecting analysis [7]. While technologies like Hi-C can capture 3D genome structure and identify long-range interactions missed by genomic distance filters, their sparsity and high cost remain challenges [7]. A systematic benchmark to compare the coverage and sensitivity of paired multi-omics technologies with single-omics approaches is currently lacking [7].​  

Experimental validation of inferred GRNs is often costly and time-consuming, particularly for matched analysis techniques, hindering the rigorous verification of computational predictions [1,6,15]. Additionally, relying solely on existing motif databases for TF binding prediction is limited by incomplete coverage and potential biases [7]. The field also requires more user-friendly tools and resources to make complex GRN inference methods accessible to a wider range of researchers.  

Potential solutions and future directions focus on developing more accurate, efficient, and robust methods [3]. To address data sparsity and noise, strategies like aggregating similar cells into metacells have shown benefits [1,7]. For large datasets, approaches include sampling subsets of cells or employing more efficient machine learning and big data processing solutions, such as utilizing gradient boosting instead of random forests or leveraging multi-threading [4,8]. Developing continuous-time models is crucial for analyzing dynamic processes and time-course data, especially when measurements are unevenly spaced [28]. Novel strategies, like FigR, are being developed to improve multi-omics integration, accounting for temporal differences and non-linear relationships [7]. Future efforts should focus on integrating diverse multi-omics data, including spatial transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility, and considering extrinsic factors such as cell-cell communication and spatial location [3,9,24].​  

Future methodological advancements include improving GRN reconstruction from large datasets, differentiating regulatory differences between cell types, and enhancing methods for predicting regulatory dynamics [9]. Combining gene regulatory dynamics prediction with single-cell clustering and trajectory inference represents a promising application [9]. The integration of deep learning, potentially borrowing innovative approaches from computer science, is expected to play a larger role [15,26], with an emphasis on developing models that offer systematic and intuitive interpretations rather than acting as black boxes [25]. Methods for causal inference, potentially incorporating meta-learning and meta-modeling, are needed to move beyond correlational analysis [3,33]. Furthermore, designing network control methods for personalized single-cell data and inferring temporal evolutionary trajectories are critical directions [26]. LINGER's approach of using lifelong learning and integrating prior knowledge like TF-RE motif matching is a step towards addressing the challenge of learning complex mechanisms and improving accuracy [29]. Developing better quantitative methods for handling chromatin accessibility data could improve GRN reconstruction [7].​  

The potential impact of addressing these challenges is substantial. Improved GRN inference methods will enhance our understanding of fundamental biological processes, such as cell differentiation, development, and response to stimuli, by accurately delineating the complex interplay of regulatory factors [2,7]. In medicine, more accurate and comprehensive GRNs, especially those derived from personalized and multi-omics data, can lead to the identification of novel disease mechanisms, crucial driver genes or regulators (e.g., in cancer [21,24]), and potential therapeutic targets [3,7]. Predicting biomarkers based on network observability is another exciting avenue for personalized medicine [26]. Integrating multiple data types and predicting dynamics holds the key to building comprehensive single-cell systems biology solutions [9].  

From my perspective, the most promising avenues for future research lie at the intersection of multi-modal data integration, explainable artificial intelligence, and causal inference. Developing robust computational frameworks that can seamlessly integrate single-cell transcriptomics with epigenomics, proteomics, and spatial data, while explicitly modeling the temporal dynamics and spatial context, will provide an unprecedented view of regulatory landscapes. Furthermore, focusing on interpretable deep learning and causal modeling will move the field beyond association towards understanding the causal regulatory relationships, enabling more effective manipulation of cellular states for therapeutic purposes. Finally, continued efforts in developing standardized benchmarks and user-friendly software are essential to make these advanced methods accessible to the broader biological research community and accelerate discovery. Addressing the inherent noise and sparsity in single-cell data through sophisticated statistical modeling and data fusion techniques remains a fundamental challenge that requires ongoing innovation.​  

# 10. Conclusion  

This survey has presented a comprehensive overview of the advancements in inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from transcriptomic data, particularly emphasizing approaches leveraging single-cell and multi-omics technologies [3]. The central importance of GRNs lies in their fundamental role in orchestrating cellular processes [3]. A thorough understanding of GRN configurations provides crucial insights into cell lineages, properties, and variations [8,9,25], thereby enabling mechanistic understanding of cell identity regulation, development, and differentiation [25].  

Beyond fundamental biological understanding, GRNs hold significant potential for biomedical applications [2,3,7]. Reconstructing regulatory networks is vital for analyzing the relationship between genotype and phenotype [5]. GRN analysis contributes to developing new perspectives in pathology [9] and identifying mechanisms underlying complex diseases [14]. Specific examples include identifying potential regulators driving disease transitions, such as from colon inflammation to colon cancer [13], constructing GRNs in colorectal cancer [12], and investigating intra-tumor heterogeneity in triple-negative breast cancer to identify potential drug targets like ETV6 [21]. Furthermore, GRN-based approaches are crucial for developing personalized medicine strategies, including finding personalized biomarkers, driver genes, and drug targets for individual cancer patients [26].  

The increasing complexity of available single-cell multi-omics data has necessitated the development of more powerful GRN inference methods [1]. Various computational techniques have been reviewed, ranging from sparse graph recovery methods from gene expression data [15] and network-based frameworks like CEFCON for deciphering driver regulators of cell fate [24], to methods leveraging graph representation learning and causal asymmetric learning such as GRINCD [13]. Methods utilizing transcription factors (TFs) and cis-regulatory sequences, like SCENIC, have proven effective for simultaneous GRN reconstruction and cell-state identification, providing biological insights into cellular heterogeneity [8,10]. CellOracle offers high-resolution cell-type-specific GRN inference [25]. Advancements integrate external data and motif knowledge, exemplified by LINGER for atlas-scale GRN inference from single-cell multiome data [29]. Deep learning methods, such as ForgeNet, also show promise for improved inference [18]. Bayesian network approaches, including continuous-time models effective for unevenly distributed data [28], continue to be explored, with methods like CAS aiming to mitigate their computational complexity and improve accuracy [27]. These computational methods enable the reconstruction of samplespecific and cell-type-specific networks [17].  

Despite significant progress, challenges remain. Current machine learning approaches face limitations in accurately inferring causal relationships and predicting network reactions to external stimuli [33]. Developing effective computational methods for personalized applications is challenging, particularly given the limitations of statistical methods reliant on large sample sizes when analyzing personalized omics data [26]. Addressing the computational complexity and potential false positives inherent in various inference methods is an ongoing task [27].  

Future directions should focus on developing methods capable of elucidating causal structures and predicting network dynamics [33]. Leveraging the full potential of multi-modal single-cell data and integrating diverse biological knowledge sources remains critical [1,29]. Continued investigation into the topological properties of inferred networks, such as scalefree, small-world, and hierarchical structures, may reveal further biological insights [6]. Advancing personalized medicine approaches based on GRNs is also a key area for future research [26]. Achieving these goals necessitates robust interdisciplinary collaboration among biologists, computer scientists, and mathematicians [3].​  

In conclusion, GRNs are indispensable for deciphering the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing cellular life. Continued development of sophisticated computational methods, driven by the wealth of single-cell and multi-omics data, is essential for overcoming existing challenges and fully realizing the potential of GRNs in both fundamental biological discovery and transformative biomedical applications.​
