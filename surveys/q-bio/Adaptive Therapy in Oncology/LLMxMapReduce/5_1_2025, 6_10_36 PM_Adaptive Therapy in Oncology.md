# 0. Adaptive Therapy in Oncology  

# 1. Introduction  

Despite significant advancements in oncology, conventional cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, continue to face substantial limitations in achieving durable patient outcomes [1,6,9,13,27]. A primary challenge is the pervasive development of drug resistance, which can manifest as either early intrinsic resistance or late acquired resistance resulting from clonal evolution [18,32]. Tumor ecosystems, comprising cancer cells, immune cells, and stroma, exhibit remarkable adaptive capacity under therapeutic pressure [4]. This adaptation and the underlying molecular heterogeneity and evolution at genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic levels drive resistance across various treatment modalities, including immunotherapy [4,18,30]. Mechanisms contributing to resistance are diverse, involving the emergence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs), senescence, and influences from the tumor microenvironment such as hypoxia, cytokines, and extracellular matrix stiffness [18]. These resistant populations often serve as seeds for metastasis and contribute to treatment failure and subsequent recurrence [18,21]. The need to overcome this evolving resistance is paramount for improving patient survival and quality of life [23,24].​

In light of these limitations, adaptive therapy (AT) has emerged as a promising novel strategy rooted in Darwinian evolutionary dynamics [1,7,13]. Unlike the conventional maximum tolerated dose (MTD) strategy, which aims for complete tumor eradication using aggressive, continuous treatment (sometimes likened to a "violent attack" [7]), AT adopts a fundamentally different objective: controlling the tumor burden rather than eliminating it entirely [1,7,13]. The MTD approach exerts strong selective pressure, often leading to the rapid outgrowth of resistant cell populations that dominate the tumor [1,4]. In contrast, AT seeks to manage the evolutionary dynamics of the tumor by dynamically adjusting treatment intensity or scheduling based on the tumor's response, aiming to maintain a stable population of drug-sensitive cells alongside resistant ones [1]. This competitive interaction, where sensitive cells suppress the growth of resistant cells, can potentially delay or prevent the dominance of resistant clones, thereby prolonging the time to disease progression and improving patient outcomes with potentially lower overall drug exposure and toxicity [1,13].  

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of adaptive therapy in oncology. It critically analyzes the limitations of current treatment paradigms, emphasizing the central role of drug resistance driven by tumor evolution and heterogeneity  

The review then introduces adaptive therapy as an innovative strategy to circumvent resistance by shifting the therapeutic goal from eradication to control. Subsequent sections will delve into the theoretical foundations and mathematical modeling approaches crucial for designing and optimizing AT strategies, explore pre-clinical and clinical evidence supporting its application, discuss associated challenges and monitoring techniques (such as liquid biopsy for detecting resistance mechanisms [20]), and outline future directions in implementing AT to revolutionize cancer management. The objective is to synthesize the current understanding of AT and highlight its potential to offer a more sustainable approach to treating cancer by proactively managing tumor evolution.​  

# 2. Scientific Basis and Principles of Adaptive Therapy  

Tumor evolution, driven by natural selection acting on intra-tumor heterogeneity within the complex tumor microenvironment, is a fundamental challenge in oncology [1,7,12]. Cancer cell populations are diverse ecosystems with varying sensitivities to therapy [7,12]. Conventional treatment strategies, such as maximum tolerated dose (MTD), exert strong, persistent selective pressures that favor the survival and proliferation of pre-existing or emergent drug-resistant clones [1,13,29]. This intense pressure eliminates drug-sensitive cells, leading to the "competitive release" of resistant populations and subsequent disease progression [1,7].  

![](images/203bcefce65789683a0b6a8564fa529d0892345ce50141cf7184b41f506e95b0.jpg)  

Adaptive therapy (AT) presents an alternative paradigm that explicitly leverages these evolutionary and ecological dynamics [1,7]. Instead of aiming for complete tumor eradication, which inevitably selects for resistance, AT seeks to control the tumor burden by managing the competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cell populations [1,7]. The core principle involves adjusting treatment dosages and timing, often through intermittent dosing or dose modulation, based on the observed tumor response [1,7,13]. This modulated approach aims to preserve a sufficient population of drug-sensitive cells [1,7]. These remaining sensitive cells act as competitive suppressors, limiting the growth and expansion of drugresistant clones and preventing their competitive release that occurs with high-dose, continuous therapy [1,7].  

By maintaining this ecological balance, AT intends to delay or prevent the dominance of resistant populations, thereby prolonging the period of effective disease control and potentially overall survival [1,29]. This approach fundamentally contrasts with MTD by shifting the therapeutic objective from maximal cell kill to long-term tumor management through evolutionary containment [1,7,13]. Beyond delaying resistance, the use of lower or intermittent doses also holds the potential for reducing cumulative drug toxicity compared to standard MTD regimens [7].  

# 2.1 Evolutionary Dynamics and Ecological Principles  

Tumor progression and treatment failure are fundamentally driven by evolutionary dynamics operating within the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment [1,7]. Tumors are intrinsically diverse ecosystems, composed of various subpopulations of cancer cells exhibiting distinct genetic defects and phenotypic characteristics [7,12]. This inherent intratumor heterogeneity provides the substrate upon which selective pressures act [12]. Conventional therapies, typically administered at maximum tolerated dose, exert a strong, sustained selective pressure that shapes the clonal landscape [1,29]. This intense pressure favors the survival and proliferation of pre-existing or newly arising drug-resistant clones, leading to a branching pattern of clonal evolution [7,29]. Studies highlight the identification of persistent “trunk” clonal clusters alongside more variable “non-trunk” clusters, with the latter often exhibiting a higher number of driver genes indicative of ongoing adaptation under therapeutic challenge [29]. Furthermore, specific subpopulations, such as cancer stem cells (CSCs), may possess inherent radioresistance, demonstrating the selective advantages present within the tumor environment under specific treatment modalities [12].​  

Adaptive therapy (AT) offers a distinct paradigm by explicitly leveraging ecological and evolutionary principles to manage rather than eradicate the tumor population [1]. Instead of applying unrelenting pressure that eliminates drug-sensitive cells and promotes the outgrowth of resistant ones, AT exploits the competitive interactions between sensitive and resistant cell populations [1]. The core strategy involves adjusting drug dosages and timing based on the tumor's response, aiming to maintain a stable tumor burden by preserving a sufficient population of drug-sensitive cells [1]. This maintained population of sensitive cells acts as a competitive suppressor, limiting the growth and expansion of the resistant clones [1]. By preventing the competitive release that occurs when sensitive cells are eradicated by high-dose therapy, AT seeks to delay or prevent the dominance of resistant populations, thereby extending the period of disease control. This approach shifts the therapeutic goal from complete eradication to long-term, stable containment of the evolutionary dynamics driving resistance.​  

# 2.2 Mathematical Modeling and Optimization  

![](images/1ad0f2944a9eabafa626cd49a21cae3064ccdbae09bb05b1649425cc2922e34b.jpg)  

Mathematical modeling plays a crucial role in developing and optimizing adaptive therapy (AT) strategies in oncology by providing a framework to capture the complex and dynamic nature of tumor ecosystems [12]. These models are essential for simulating tumor growth and treatment response, incorporating key biological parameters to design and optimize AT protocols and predict clinical outcomes [1].​  

Different mathematical approaches are employed to represent tumor dynamics. Population-level models, such as the LotkaVolterra model, are used to simulate the competitive interactions between different tumor cell populations, typically distinguishing between treatment-sensitive and treatment-resistant variants [1]. Alternatively, agent-based models (ABM) offer a more granular approach, simulating individual cell populations and their complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment [1]. For specific therapeutic modalities like radiotherapy, models can also be tailored to capture the heterogeneity within the tumor, such as considering cell types with differential radiosensitivities like cancer stem cells  

(CSCs) and non-CSCs [12]. While population models provide insights into overall population dynamics, ABMs can capture spatial effects and emergent properties arising from local interactions.  

Parameterizing these mathematical models involves assigning numerical values to variables such as cell growth rates, drug sensitivity coefficients, and carrying capacities [1]. A significant challenge in translating theoretical models to clinical practice is the difficulty in obtaining accurate, patient-specific data for robust model parameterization. This limitation affects the predictive power of the models and the ability to personalize AT regimens effectively.  

Despite these challenges, mathematical models are instrumental in predicting optimal treatment schedules and guiding adaptive decisions. By simulating the effects of different dosing regimens and timings, models can forecast the tumor's response and evolution under therapy [1]. For instance, models can be used to determine the optimal temporal distribution of radiation dose aimed at maximizing tumor cell kill in heterogeneous populations [12].​  

Optimization algorithms are integral to identifying effective AT regimens by processing model predictions or real-time data to determine the best course of action at each decision point. These algorithms search for treatment strategies that optimize a defined objective, such as maximizing overall survival or minimizing cumulative drug toxicity while maintaining disease control. Examples include numerical optimization algorithms designed to find optimal dose distributions in radiotherapy planning and game theory-driven algorithms used to adapt drug dosages based on observed tumor response [12,13]. The application of such algorithms, like the AT-1 algorithm used in a mouse model of breast cancer, has demonstrated improved tumor control and survival compared to conventional strategies, highlighting the potential of algorithm-guided dosing in enhancing treatment outcomes [13]. Thus, the synergy between mathematical modeling and optimization algorithms provides a powerful toolset for designing and implementing dynamic and personalized AT strategies.  

# 3. Mechanisms of Resistance in Cancer  

Cancer therapy resistance represents a formidable obstacle to achieving durable treatment responses and long-term survival in oncology.

This complex phenomenon arises from the inherent capacity of cancer cell populations to evade therapeutic insults through diverse and interconnected mechanisms [8,18]. These mechanisms can be broadly classified into genetic, epigenetic [26], and phenotypic categories, each contributing distinct avenues for tumor adaptation and survival under selective pressure [1].​  

Genetic resistance mechanisms involve alterations in the DNA sequence or structure, including the acquisition of somatic mutations [29,32], chromosomal instability (CIN), or gene amplifications/deletions that affect drug targets or downstream signaling pathways [29]. Epigenetic modifications, conversely, alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence, encompassing changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA regulation [10,26]. These modifications can reversibly remodel chromatin structure, influencing the expression of genes critical for drug response, cell fate, and survival [26]. Phenotypic plasticity refers to the ability of cancer cells to reversibly change their characteristics or state in response to environmental cues or therapeutic stress [8,18]. This can manifest as transitions to a more stem-cell-like state, metabolic reprogramming, or alterations in proliferation rates, conferring transient or stable drug tolerance [4,18].  

Therapeutic resistance can manifest as either intrinsic (primary) or acquired resistance [21,23,32]. Intrinsic resistance is present prior to therapy initiation, often stemming from pre-existing genetic alterations, inherent tumor heterogeneity (ITH), or specific characteristics of the tumor microenvironment [7,19]. Acquired resistance develops during or after treatment, driven by the Darwinian selection and expansion of pre-existing or newly emerging resistant clones under the selective pressure of therapy [29,32]. Acquired resistance mechanisms are diverse and involve further genetic mutations, epigenetic adaptations, and dynamic changes in cellular phenotype and the tumor microenvironment [19,21]. While intrinsic resistance dictates the initial response, acquired resistance is the primary driver of treatment failure and relapse in responders, representing a key challenge that Adaptive Therapy (AT) strategies aim to address by modulating selective pressures [23].​  

The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a fundamental and multifaceted role in promoting therapy resistance [4]. Composed of cancer cells, immune cells, stromal cells, vasculature, and extracellular matrix, the TME creates a complex ecosystem that facilitates tumor survival and immune evasion through cellular interactions and secreted factors [18,28]. Within this context, Adaptive Immune Resistance (AIR) is a critical mechanism by which tumors actively evade immune surveillance, particularly impacting the efficacy of immunotherapies [11,30]. AIR involves diverse strategies, including the upregulation of inhibitory ligands (e.g., PD-L1), secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., TGF- $\beta$ , CSF-1), recruitment of suppressive immune cells (e.g., MDSCs, Tregs), and metabolic hijacking of immune cells [11,31]. The specific composition and state of the Tumor Immune Microenvironment (TIME) significantly influence the patterns and mechanisms of resistance to immune checkpoint blockade [11].​  

A distinct subpopulation contributing to drug tolerance and subsequent relapse consists of Persistent Cancer Cells (PCCs), also known as drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs) [8,18]. These cells survive initial therapy primarily through non-genomic mechanisms [21], such as slow proliferation or quiescence, metabolic flexibility, activation of stress response pathways, and significant phenotypic plasticity, often exhibiting cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics [8,18]. Drug tolerance in PCCs is often a transient state, but continuous therapeutic pressure can lead to the stabilization of these tolerant phenotypes into stable, heritable resistance [18]. The interplay between PCCs and the TME further dictates their survival and potential to drive relapse [18].​  

In summary, cancer resistance is a multifaceted process driven by a dynamic interplay of genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications, and cellular plasticity within the complex tumor microenvironment. Resistance can be pre-existing (intrinsic) or acquired under therapeutic pressure, with AT primarily focused on managing the latter. Mechanisms such as Adaptive Immune Resistance and the survival strategies of Persistent Cancer Cells represent critical components of this resistance landscape. A comprehensive understanding of these diverse and interacting mechanisms is essential for developing rational strategies, including adaptive therapeutic approaches, aimed at overcoming or managing treatment failure and improving patient outcomes.​  

# 3.1 Overview of Resistance Mechanisms (Genetic, Epigenetic, Phenotypic)  

Cancer therapy resistance is a complex phenomenon driven by a multifaceted array of molecular and cellular mechanisms, broadly categorized into genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications, and phenotypic plasticity [1,8,18]. These  

mechanisms enable cancer cells to evade the cytotoxic or growth-inhibitory effects of therapeutic agents, representing a major challenge in oncology.  

Genetic mechanisms of resistance involve alterations to the cancer cell genome, which can arise spontaneously or be acquired under selective pressure from treatment [7,29]. These include somatic mutations, such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (INDELs) [29], and chromosomal instability (CIN) leading to larger genomic alterations [29]. Specific genetic alterations in oncogenes, such as RAS, BRAF, EGFR, PIK3CA, ALK, and BCR-ABL, are welldocumented drivers of resistance to targeted therapies designed to inhibit these pathways [32]. Similarly, mutations in hormone receptor genes like ESR1 and ESR2 contribute significantly to endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer [10]. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) exhibits resistance partly through hypermutation [19].​  

Epigenetic modifications, which alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence, also play a critical role in drug evasion [8,10,26]. These modifications include changes in histone acetylation and methylation, DNA methylation, and alterations in transcriptome and RNA methylation [19,26]. Epigenetic changes can modify chromatin structure, affecting the accessibility of transcription factors and thus altering the expression profiles of genes involved in drug response, cell differentiation, and apoptosis [26]. For instance, epigenetic modulators like HDAC inhibitors can restore normal cellular functions by maintaining histone acetylation and modifying chromatin [26]. Non-genetic events involving chromatin remodeling and stress-related pathways are crucial in establishing drug tolerance [18].  

Phenotypic plasticity refers to the ability of cancer cells to reversibly change their state or characteristics in response to environmental pressures, including therapy, leading to drug tolerance [1,8,18]. This plasticity is often influenced by epigenetic alterations [19]. Examples include transitions to a more stem-cell-like state, characterized by cancer stem cell (CSC) properties that confer enhanced survival and resistance to various therapies, including radiation [12,24]. Phenotypic changes can also involve metabolic reprogramming; cancer cells exhibit metabolic plasticity, switching between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to adapt to stress induced by treatments like PI3K or BRAF inhibitors [4]. Key regulators such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and HIF1 mediate this metabolic adaptation [4].  

Specific resistance mechanisms vary depending on the therapeutic modality [21]. For targeted therapies, resistance frequently involves genetic alterations that reactivate downstream signaling pathways (e.g., activation of PI3K/Akt or RasMAPK pathways following targeted inhibition) or activation of bypass pathways [10,32]. Chemotherapy resistance can arise from mechanisms such as enhanced DNA damage repair capacity, activation of cell cycle checkpoints in response to replication stress induced by drugs like PARP inhibitors, or metabolic adaptations [4]. Resistance to immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade, involves mechanisms like adaptive immune resistance (AIR), where tumor cells upregulate inhibitory ligands such as PD-L1, impairing T cell function within the tumor microenvironment [11,23]. Proteins like USPs also influence drug resistance by affecting diverse processes such as DNA damage repair, apoptosis, cancer stem cell characteristics, and immune evasion [24]. Tumor heterogeneity, revealed by techniques like single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), highlights the co-existence of subpopulations within a tumor, each potentially harboring distinct resistance mechanisms (genetic, epigenetic, or phenotypic), contributing to the overall challenge of treatment [19,32]. Understanding the complex interplay between these different classes of resistance mechanisms is fundamental to developing strategies that can overcome or manage treatment failure.​  

# 3.2 Intrinsic vs. Acquired Resistance  

Therapeutic resistance in oncology represents a fundamental challenge to achieving durable disease control. This resistance can be broadly categorized into two primary types: intrinsic (or primary, innate, de novo) and acquired (or adaptive) resistance [18,21,23,32]. Intrinsic resistance refers to the pre-existence of resistant cancer cells or resistance‐conferring mechanisms within the tumor prior to any therapeutic intervention [18,21]. This inherent insensitivity leads to a lack of initial response to therapy [23]. Examples of mechanisms contributing to intrinsic resistance include the presence of pre‐ existing genetic alterations, specific tumor microenvironment characteristics like immunosuppression or lack of T cell infiltration, inherent inter‐ and intra‐tumoral heterogeneity (ITH), immune dysfunction, and the presence of intrinsically resistant cell subpopulations such as cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) [11,12,19]. Studies have shown that CSCs possess pre existing mechanisms conferring greater resistance to treatments like radiation therapy compared to non-CSCs [12]. The presence of these pre‐existing factors poses a significant challenge to the success of initial treatment strategies, as a fraction of the tumor population may be inherently refractory from the outset [18,29].​  

![](images/77d71281898d9e5a9c27fe9368501bdbaaebe781dbf31cf866bba3efc138e519.jpg)  

In contrast, acquired resistance develops over time duringor folowingexposure to therapeutic agents [18,21,23]. This phenomenon arises from the evolutionary adaptation of the tumor population under the selective pressure imposed by the treatment [32]. Mechanisms driving acquired resistance are diverse and include the selection and expansion of initially rare or newly emerged resistant clones [19,29,32], treatment-induced genetic alterations (non-trunk mutations) [29], epigenetic adaptations, changes in the tumor microenvironment, and cellular plasticity, particularly the adaptation and increased resistance of CSCs/GSCs post-treatment [19,21]. Specific molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance documented in the digests include functional loss mutations in genes such as ​JAK1 and ​JAK2 , truncating mutations in $B 2 M$ , increased expression of inhibitory molecules like HAVCR2 (TIM3) in the context of immunotherapy, or differential activation of signaling pathways and alterations in cell cycle regulators in targeted or endocrine therapies [10,11]. The re-emergence of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) after initial suppression exemplifies the selection and re-emergence of resistant clones, characteristic of acquired resistance [29]. Acquired resistance represents a major evolutionary challenge for achieving longterm disease control, as tumors dynamically evolve mechanisms to evade therapy over time [8].​  

While both intrinsic and acquired resistance contribute to treatment failure, adaptive therapy (AT) is primarily conceptualized and designed to manage acquired resistance. Standard therapies aim for maximum tumor kill, inadvertently imposing strong selective pressures that favor the outgrowth of resistant populations. AT strategies, conversely, seek to alter these selective pressures, often by maintaining a population of drug-sensitive cells that can suppress the proliferation of resistant cells, thereby delaying or preventing the emergence of acquired resistance and extending the duration of treatment response. While understanding intrinsic resistance is crucial for initial treatment selection, the dynamic management of the evolutionary process leading to acquired resistance is the core focus of adaptive therapeutic approaches.​  

# 3.3 Role of the Tumor Microenvironment (including Adaptive Immune Resistance)  

The tumor microenvironment (TME) represents a complex and dynamic ecosystem that significantly influences cancer progression and therapeutic response, acting as a critical determinant of resistance to both conventional treatments and immunotherapies [4]. This intricate milieu comprises diverse cellular components, including cancer cells, immune cells (lymphocytes, macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells), fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and adipocytes, embedded within an extracellular matrix and permeated by various soluble factors such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and metabolites [11,18,28]. The complex interactions within this environment orchestrate immunosuppression and promote resistance mechanisms [4].​  

Adaptive Immune Resistance (AIR) is intrinsically linked to the TME, with detailed analysis revealing diverse contributing mechanisms [11,30]. Tumors actively mediate immune evasion by producing soluble factors that program both innate and adaptive immune cells within the TME, thereby facilitating tumor progression [4]. For instance, BRAF inhibition in melanoma mouse models can lead to the recruitment and reprogramming of macrophages toward a pro-tumorigenic M2 phenotype. These macrophages increase vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion, which subsequently reactivates ERK signaling in melanoma cells, contributing to therapeutic resistance [4]. Furthermore, targeted therapies designed to inhibit cancer cell survival can exert direct effects on immune cell function, inadvertently shaping the immune landscape toward a less effective anti-tumor response [4].  

A classification of tumors based on the Tumor Immune Microenvironment (TIME) highlights distinct resistance patterns [11]. Type I tumors are characterized by a lack of inflammation (PD-L1-/TIL-), attributed to an absence of immune cell infiltration [11]. Type II tumors $( P D - L 1 + / \mathsf { T } | L + )$ ) exemplify AIR primarily mediated by the engagement of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway [11]. Type III tumors $( P D - L 1 - / 7 1 L + )$ exhibit T cell dysfunction independent of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis [11]. Type IV tumors (PD$\lfloor 1 + / \mathsf { T } \mathsf { l } \mathsf { L } \bigr )$ display constitutive PD-L1 expression driven by oncogenic pathways, potentially rendering them susceptible to targeted therapies [11]. The presence of effector T cells, such as CD8⁺ T cells and TH1 cells, within the TME is generally associated with a better prognosis and may mitigate primary resistance, whereas suppressive cell populations—including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)—can promote primary resistance [11].  

Specific components of the immunosuppressive TME contribute significantly to therapy resistance. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and MDSCs are prominent suppressors of cytotoxic T cells [19,28]. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the TME is notably immunosuppressive, with high percentages of TAMs promoting tumor growth and immune evasion; Tcell dysfunction is further exacerbated by factors such as T-cell sequestration [19]. Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), often influenced by the TME, can also evade immune therapies through mechanisms such as downregulating major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, increasing Treg cell numbers, and elevating the production of suppressive factors like transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$ ) by TAMs [19]. Soluble molecules released by stromal cells—including nitric oxide from the endothelium (which activates Notch) and factors such as hepatocyte growth factor, osteopontin, and stromal-derived factor 1α from cancer-associated fibroblasts (which activate WNT)—can initiate CSC-like programs and promote conventional drug resistance [18]. Tumor-associated macrophages also support CSCs, and exosomes from niche cells can transfer factors like miR-221 to enhance the drug-resistant CSC population [18].​  

The immunosuppressive TME in certain cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, presents a significant challenge to immunotherapy efficacy [28]. Soluble factors like Colony-Stimulating Factor-1 (CSF-1) are produced by tumors and recruit immunosuppressive cells like MDSCs [28]. TGF- $\beta$ is another multifunctional cytokine in the TME that promotes immunosuppression, as well as angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [28]. The expression of CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) on tumor and Treg cells also influences the immune balance [28]. Even tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), although naturally present, are often found in an exhausted or suppressed state within the TME, necessitating strategies such as ex vivo expansion and reinfusion to overcome this suppression [5]. Epigenetic regulation within immune cells in the TME—for example, histone modifications like lysine acetylation that regulate cytokine gene transcription in macrophages—further highlights the complexity and potential for modulation [26].​  

Strategies to modulate the TME and overcome resistance are under investigation, potentially integrating with Adaptive Therapy (AT) approaches. Modulating stromal components and targeting chronic inflammation are being explored to improve T cell infiltration [31]. Approaches that target specific immunosuppressive factors like CSF-1 and TGF- $\beta$ are key to this strategy [28]. Additionally, targeting cell surface receptors such as CCR4 can shift the immune balance by decreasing suppressive Tregs and potentially increasing anti-tumor NK cells [28]. Novel approaches include the use of copper-based nanoagents, such as metabolism-targeting $C u _ { 2 - x } S$ (MACuS), which have shown promise in regulating the immunosuppressive TME, thereby enhancing systemic anti-tumor immunity and preventing metastasis and recurrence [34]. Nanoparticle-based delivery systems targeting the TME are also being explored as a strategy to overcome resistance to therapies like PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, particularly in cancers such as lung cancer [30]. By modifying the TME to favor antitumor immunity, these strategies offer potential avenues to enhance the efficacy of existing and future cancer therapies, warranting further exploration into their integration within dynamic, adaptive treatment schedules.​  

# 3.4 Persistent Cancer Cells and Drug Tolerance  

Persistent cancer cells (PCCs), often referred to as drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs), represent a critical subpopulation of tumor cells that survive initial drug exposure, serving as a significant source of subsequent resistance and tumor relapse [8,18,29]. This concept is inherently linked to cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are known for their ability to survive treatment, including increased radioresistance, and contribute to relapse [12]. The identification of a “persistent trunk” subgroup in clonal evolution models further supports the existence of cells capable of surviving various treatment regimens, potentially representing these drug-tolerant persisters [29].  

The drug tolerance exhibited by PCCs/DTPs is primarily mediated by non-genomic mechanisms, distinguishing it from stable genetic resistance [8,21]. Key mechanisms underlying drug tolerance include slow proliferation or quiescence, flexible energy consumption, adaptation to the microenvironment, and significant phenotypic plasticity [8,18]. DTPs are often largely quiescent, maintaining viability while the majority of the rapidly proliferating cancer cells are eliminated by therapy [18]. Cellular stress response pathways also play a role; for example, the integrated stress response (ISR), initiated by kinases like PERK and GCN2 phosphorylating eIF2α, promotes cap-independent translation of stress-relief mRNAs, which can enable survival under treatment-induced stress [4]. Phenotypic plasticity can manifest as dedifferentiation into stem cell-like properties, increasing tumor diversity and resilience [19].  

Crucially, drug tolerance is often a transient state that can potentially revert upon cessation of the cytotoxic stimulus [18]. This contrasts with stable genetic resistance, which typically involves fixed genetic alterations. However, continuous drug exposure or other cellular stresses, such as hypoxia, can drive the stabilization of this temporary drug tolerance into enduring drug resistance [18]. While treatment can also lead to diverse genetic changes like hypermutation in some tumors, contributing to genetic resistance [19], the focus regarding PCCs is on their non-genetic, plastic survival strategies.  

The existence and dynamics of PCCs/DTPs pose a significant challenge in oncology, particularly for therapies aiming for a durable response. Adaptive therapy (AT) strategies, which seek to manage resistance by modulating selective pressures rather than eliminating all cells, are inherently concerned with the population dynamics of resistant or tolerant cells like PCCs. By altering the treatment schedule or dose, AT could potentially influence the transition dynamics between transient tolerance and stable resistance, possibly preventing the enrichment or stabilization of highly resistant phenotypes originating from the PCC population. Managing these reversible, non-genomic tolerant states is a key consideration for optimizing AT approaches to prevent relapse driven by surviving cells [8,29].  

# 4. Adaptive Therapy Strategies and Clinical Applications  

Adaptive therapy (AT) in oncology represents a paradigm shift from traditional maximum tolerated dose (MTD) strategies, focusing instead on dynamically adjusting treatment based on the tumor's evolutionary response and patient condition. Core AT strategies employed in clinical settings include intermittent dosing and dose modulation guided by indicators of tumor burden or sensitivity, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels [1,7,13]. This approach aims to manage sensitive and resistant tumor cell populations, potentially prolonging the time to resistance and improving treatment outcomes while reducing cumulative drug exposure and associated toxicity [1,7,13].​  

![](images/2d959503c2a3e796ff34c831ff3525880d6702094d76032433a09312689bf32c.jpg)  

Clinical trials are instrumental in evaluating the effectiveness of AT across various cancer types and treatment modalities [1]. These trials are designed to assess endpoints such as progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and healthrelated quality of life (HRQOL) [1,2]. Adaptive platform trials, which utilize designs like response-adaptive randomization, are also being employed to efficiently evaluate multiple therapeutic strategies and optimize treatment selection [14].  

Clinical evidence for AT's effectiveness compared to standard approaches is emerging, particularly in prostate cancer. A notable trial in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer demonstrated that an AT approach, where abiraterone was administered intermittently based on PSA levels, maintained stable tumor burden in a significantly higher proportion of patients and prolonged the median time to progression compared to continuous MTD therapy [1,7,13]. This was achieved while substantially reducing the cumulative drug dose [1,13]. Similar adaptive principles are being explored in other cancers, including lung cancer with "加减法" (addition-subtraction) strategies involving multi-modal adjustments across different stages and treatment types [3], breast cancer management of endocrine resistance [10], and intermittent dosing strategies in melanoma [1].​  

The application of AT is frequently integrated with combination therapies, acknowledging the inherent heterogeneity and adaptive potential of tumors [1,26]. Combinatorial approaches, whether involving chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or novel modalities, are designed to simultaneously target multiple pathways or cell populations, aiming to circumvent resistance and enhance efficacy [11,26]. Adaptive dosing or scheduling within these combinations represents a key strategy to optimize their evolutionary impact [1]. Furthermore, the field is actively exploring the integration of emerging targets and therapeutic modalities, such as strategies targeting cuproptosis [34], Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidases (USPs) [24], and various adoptive cell therapies like TCR-T and TIL therapy [5,6,9] into future adaptive protocols.  

While initial clinical results, particularly in prostate cancer, show promise for AT in terms of disease control and reduced drug burden compared to standard continuous MTD, broader clinical validation across diverse cancer types and treatment modalities is required [1,7,13]. Further research is needed to define optimal patient populations, appropriate biomarkers for guiding adaptive decisions, and robust clinical trial designs that capture the unique benefits of evolutionary-informed treatment strategies. The integration of complex biological data and predictive modeling remains a challenge but is essential for the successful implementation and advancement of AT in clinical practice.​  

# 4.1 Adaptive Therapy in Specific Cancer Types  

The application of adaptive therapy (AT) principles in oncology is profoundly shaped by the unique biological characteristics, evolutionary dynamics, and established treatment landscapes of different cancer types. Tailoring AT protocols requires addressing cancer‐specific challenges such as primary or acquired drug resistance, harnessing opportunities like immune activation, and integrating AT within existing standard‐of‐care regimens. This section evaluates the implementation and outcomes of AT strategies across various malignancies, highlighting how approaches are customized based on tumor biology and clinical context, drawing comparisons between strategies like the "加减法" in lung cancer and methods addressing endocrine resistance in breast and prostate cancers [3,10].

Lung cancer, particularly non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), provides a rich domain for exploring adaptive strategies across its different stages. A prominent approach is the "加减法" (addition‐subtraction) strategy, which dynamically modifies treatment intensity and modality based on patient and tumor characteristics [3]. In early‐stage NSCLC, "subtraction" can involve de‐escalation, such as sub‐lobar resection for small, node‐negative tumors, showing comparable survival to lobectomy in trials like JCOG0802/WJOG4607L and GALGB 140503 [3]. Conversely, "addition" involves treatment intensification, exemplified by combining stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with immunotherapy (I‐SABR) for inoperable stage I–II NSCLC, demonstrating a promising 4‐year event‐free survival rate of $7 7 \%$ in a Phase II study [3]. Perioperative strategies also incorporate adaptive principles; adjuvant osimertinib is effective for _EGFR_-mutated stage IB–IIIA patients regardless of prior chemotherapy, while neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy shows significant effects in trials like CheckMate 816 and KEYNOTE-671, prompting efforts to identify patients who may not require subsequent adjuvant immunotherapy [3]. For locally advanced NSCLC, "addition" is explored through concurrent CRT with immunotherapy (e.g., NICOLAS, DETERRED, KEYNOTE-799), though outcomes vary, as seen in the PACIFIC 2 trial [3]. The "sandwich mode" (induction immunochemotherapy $+ { \mathsf { C R T } } +$ consolidation immunotherapy) has shown potential for increasing resectability and improving PFS [3]. In advanced NSCLC, adaptive integration of local therapies (e.g., SABR) into systemic treatment for oligometastatic disease has shown PFS and OS benefits in _EGFR_-mutated patients (SINDAS trial) [3]. For challenging scenarios like leptomeningeal metastases, adaptive high‐dose regimens are explored, balancing efficacy with toxicity [3]. In _EGFR_-mutated advanced disease, trials like FLAURA2 and MARIPOSA-2 demonstrate the  

benefit of adaptively adding chemotherapy or novel agents to first‐line TKIs based on evolving resistance landscapes [3]. Beyond traditional modalities, adoptive cell therapies like TIL therapy have shown efficacy in advanced NSCLC refractory to prior treatment, including instances of complete remission [5,6]. The variable objective response rates to anti‐PD‐1/PD‐ L1 therapies in NSCLC highlight the inherent adaptive nature of the immune response and the need for strategies to overcome resistance [11]. Epigenetic heterogeneity in lung adenocarcinoma also adds layers of complexity relevant to treatment adaptation [26]. Biological therapies are broadly applicable in lung cancer treatment [33].  

Breast cancer presents specific challenges, particularly the development of endocrine resistance in hormone receptor‐ positive subtypes that depend on steroid hormones [10]. Adaptive strategies aim to manage this resistance. Preclinical studies using evolution‐based adaptive therapy algorithms in breast cancer models have shown promise, prolonging progression‐free survival while utilizing lower drug doses compared to conventional MTD approaches [1,13]. Clinical trial designs are also adapting; the I‐SPY 2 trial is an adaptive platform trial used to improve treatment selection for locally advanced breast cancer patients based on biomarker responses, reflecting an adaptive approach to clinical investigation [14]. Adoptive cell therapies like TIL therapy are being explored, with notable reports of complete remission in advanced metastatic breast cancer cases [5,6]. Biological therapies play a significant role in breast cancer management [33]. Adaptive management extends to supportive care, with studies examining the impact of interventions like exercise on quality of life in metastatic breast cancer patients [16].​  

Prostate cancer, another hormone‐dependent malignancy, also faces significant challenges from endocrine resistance [10]. Adaptive therapy trials in metastatic castration‐resistant prostate cancer have demonstrated favorable outcomes. One trial showed that AT, guided by PSA levels and potentially involving drug holiday or dose modulation of agents like Zytiga, maintained stable tumor burden in a higher proportion of patients compared to MTD (10/11 vs. 2/16) [1,7,13]. Furthermore, AT significantly prolonged the median time to progression (at least 27.0 months vs. 16.5 months for MTD) while substantially reducing the cumulative drug dose ( $4 7 \%$ of MTD) [1]. Adaptive platform trials, such as STAMPEDE, are used to efficiently evaluate multiple new therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer alongside standard care [14]. Biological therapies are also incorporated into prostate cancer treatment [33].  

Melanoma is recognized for its relative immunogenicity and higher objective response rates to anti‐PD‐1/PD‐L1 therapies compared to some other cancers [11]. Adoptive cell therapies, particularly TIL therapy, represent a potent adaptive strategy for advanced melanoma, especially in patients refractory to PD‐1 blockade. Trials report objective response rates of $3 1 . 4 \%$ and disease control rates of $7 7 . 8 \%$ , with case studies demonstrating durable complete remissions lasting over 9 years [5,6]. TCR-T therapy has also shown promising results, including complete remission and significant tumor reduction in specific melanoma cases [9].  

Adaptive and novel therapeutic approaches are being explored across many other cancer types. Glioblastoma presents unique challenges in overcoming immunotherapy resistance, requiring strategies tailored to its highly immunosuppressive microenvironment and genetic heterogeneity [19]. Pancreatic cancer treatment is evolving with investigations into immunotherapy regimens [28] and recent approvals establishing potential new standards of care [33]. In Cholangiocarcinoma, TIL therapy has demonstrated potential for long-term survival in advanced cases [6]. Colorectal cancer is another target for TIL therapy, showing partial response in metastatic disease with specific mutations [5], and epigenetic patterns represent important biological complexities influencing treatment [26]. Biological therapies are also relevant [33]. Cervical cancer is a focus for both TIL therapy, which has shown promising PFS and OS outcomes in a Phase I study [5], and TCR-T therapy [9]. Gastric cancer exhibits variable immunotherapy response rates [11], with new approved targeted therapies expanding options [33]. Research in Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma delves into clonal evolution and gene regulatory networks to inform future adaptive strategies [29]. Other malignancies such as renal cancer, fallopian tube cancer, ovarian cancer, urothelial carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and bone sarcoma are subjects of ongoing investigations into adoptive cell therapies and biological treatments, underscoring the broad applicability of these tailored approaches [5,9].​  

Comparing these cancer-specific strategies reveals distinct adaptive paradigms. The "加减法" in lung cancer is a multi-modal approach integrating surgical, radiotherapeutic, and systemic therapy adjustments across different disease stages and molecular subtypes [3]. This contrasts with the AT explored in prostate and breast cancers, which heavily focuses on adaptively managing endocrine resistance through dose modulation or drug cycling guided by biomarkers, aiming for disease control rather than immediate eradication with MTD, thereby potentially reducing toxicity and delaying resistance [1,7,10]. Adoptive cell therapies represent a distinct adaptive strategy, particularly impactful in immunogenic tumors like  

melanoma or those with targetable mutations, providing a potentially curative "addition" even in heavily pre-treated settings [5,6,9]. The success and limitations of these varied AT approaches underscore the necessity of tailoring treatment strategies to the specific evolutionary dynamics, biological vulnerabilities, and treatment resistance mechanisms inherent to each cancer type. While promising outcomes like prolonged control, complete remissions, and reduced treatment burden are observed, challenges related to predicting response, managing treatment-related toxicities, and overcoming the ultimate development of resistance remain critical areas for further research.  

# 4.2 Combination Therapies with Adaptive Approaches  

The inherent heterogeneity and evolutionary potential of tumor cell populations present significant challenges to achieving durable responses with single-agent therapies. Consequently, the integration of adaptive therapy (AT) principles with combinatorial regimens has emerged as a crucial strategy to enhance efficacy and overcome treatment resistance [1,19,26]. Combinational therapy, by simultaneously targeting multiple pathways or cell populations, aims to address tumor complexity, circumvent compensatory mechanisms, limit metastasis, and minimize the risk of drug resistance compared to sequential or single-agent approaches [26].​  

![](images/2fc82a85aa226f4fd886a3f651c7ef78d8c55d6224f088d686932690a37fe905.jpg)  

Combining AT with chemotherapy represents a foundational approach. Modeling studies using the Lotka–Volterra framework have explored evolution-based dual-drug dosing strategies. This includes distinguishing between major and minor drugs to manage population dynamics effectively [1]. Clinical application of a major drug–minor drug approach, such as the combination of abiraterone with docetaxel in castration-resistant prostate cancer, has demonstrated significantly prolonged disease progression compared to traditional single-agent abiraterone AT [1]. Intriguingly, further modeling suggests that an antagonistic relationship between the two drugs within a dual-drug regimen may be more effective at combating resistance evolution than a synergistic relationship [1]. Beyond formal AT strategies, conventional chemotherapy is often combined with other agents to address resistance, for instance, CD47 inhibitors with temozolomide in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [19] or cuproptosis-targeting therapies like elesclomol with paclitaxel, which showed enhanced effects in specific melanoma subsets [34].​  

Targeted therapies are frequently combined with other modalities to counteract resistance driven by adaptive responses. This involves pairing targeted agents with other drugs or chemotherapy to overcome compensatory signaling or bypass resistance mechanisms [26]. Examples include the combination of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) with the MET bispecific antibody amivantamab in _EGFR_-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who developed resistance to initial targeted therapy, demonstrating improved progression-free survival [3]. Inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzymes (USPs) are also being explored in combination with existing anti-cancer therapies to circumvent drug resistance [24]. Furthermore, strategies targeting metabolic adaptation, such as coordinately inhibiting the pentose phosphate shunt and glutamine hydrolysis, aim to increase treatment-induced metabolic stress and sensitize cells to reactive oxygen species, thereby enhancing the efficacy of targeted approaches [4].  

Immunotherapy combinations are pivotal for overcoming the diverse mechanisms of adaptive immune resistance [11,19]. Combining different immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 with anti-CTLA-4, is a common strategy, although sequential administration may be considered to reduce toxicity while potentially maintaining efficacy [11]. Adoptive cell therapies like tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy have also shown promise in combination, for instance, with nivolumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) for advanced NSCLC that became resistant to prior nivolumab treatment [5,6]. Immunotherapy is extensively combined with other treatment types: chemotherapy combined with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy has demonstrated improved overall survival in various cancers including NSCLC, SCLC, and triple-negative breast cancer [11]. Combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors with targeted therapies, such as pembrolizumab with osimertinib, have shown promising objective response rates and overall survival [11]. Other targeted combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors include anti-PD-1/L1 or anti-CTLA-4 with inhibitors of CSF-1, TGF- $\beta$ receptor, VEGF, CC chemokine receptor 4, CXCR4–CXCL12 axis, or various kinase/PARP inhibitors. Modulating the tumor microenvironment through combinatorial therapies, such as targeting pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) stroma and inflammation, is also employed to improve the infiltration and efficacy of cancer-targeted immune cells [31]. Furthermore, the synergy between different biological therapies, such as combining immunotherapy with oncolytic viruses or cancer vaccines, is increasingly recognized [33].​  

Integrating Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) into cancer therapy represents another avenue for combinatorial strategies, potentially complementing AT approaches [27]. TCM can be combined with chemotherapy to improve therapeutic effectiveness while simultaneously reducing toxic side effects and enhancing safety [27]. When combined with targeted therapy or immunotherapy, TCM has shown the potential to augment anti-tumor activity [27]. An illustrative example is the combination of Complex Ku Shen Injection (CKI) with sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which exerts effects by targeting both tumor cells directly and modulating the immunological microenvironment [27].  

# 4.3 Emerging Targets and Strategies for Adaptive Therapy  

The landscape of oncology is continuously evolving with the identification of novel molecular targets and therapeutic modalities, which hold significant potential for integration into adaptive therapy (AT) frameworks. Exploiting these emerging opportunities is crucial for developing dynamic treatment strategies capable of circumventing resistance and improving long-term outcomes.  

One area of emerging therapeutic interest is cuproptosis, a newly recognized form of regulated cell death driven by mitochondrial copper accumulation [34]. Research suggests cuproptosis is a potential target for breast cancer therapy, with various strategies under investigation [34]. These include utilizing copper compounds, combination therapies, and nanotechnology-based delivery methods [34]. The interaction between EGFR and copper also presents an avenue for therapeutic exploration in breast cancer [34]. Moreover, copper-chelating agents, which induce copper poisoning, have demonstrated the capacity to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-L1 treatments, suggesting a potential synergy with immunotherapy [34]. Small-molecule compounds that disrupt copper homeostasis can either induce or augment tumor cell sensitivity to cuproptosis [34]. Specifically, zinc pyrithione has shown promise in eliciting cuproptosis in triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) cells by disturbing intracellular copper homeostasis and inhibiting DLAT oligomerization, potentially enhancing chemosensitivity [34]. Integrating strategies targeting cuproptosis into AT could involve monitoring cellular copper levels or cuproptosis markers and adaptively deploying copper-modulating agents or synergistic therapies when resistance mechanisms related to metabolism or mitochondrial function emerge.​  

Another critical area for AT is addressing mechanisms of drug resistance. Targeting Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidases (USPs) represents an effective approach to combat drug resistance across various cancer types [24]. As USPs are involved in stabilizing proteins crucial for cell survival and proliferation, including those implicated in resistance pathways, their inhibition can potentially restore sensitivity to previously ineffective drugs [24]. Incorporating USP inhibitors into AT could involve their use in response to detected resistance to standard-of-care agents, aiming to re-sensitize tumor cells and allow for the reintroduction or continued efficacy of initial therapies within a controlled, adaptive schedule.  

Beyond cuproptosis and USPs, a spectrum of other emerging targets and strategies are being explored that could be leveraged within AT frameworks. These include epigenetic targets like Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors targeting enzymes such as CREBBP, CDY1, CDY2, and CLOCK, and Histone Methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitors like Tazemetostat (an EZH2 inhibitor) which has received regulatory approval for specific indications [26]. Other targets involve components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune system modulators, such as CD47, CSF1R, CD73, COX2, CCL2/CCR2, IL6, and GITR inhibitors [11,19]. Strategies like modulating the local TME using PRR agonists (e.g., interferon type I, TLR ligands, STING agonists) or targeting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with antibodies against CCL2, CSF-1R, and CCR2 are also being investigated [11]. Furthermore, targeting cancer stem cells (GSC) through subtype discrimination is highlighted as a potential avenue for personalized approaches [19]. The identification of neoantigens and tumor stroma-associated antigens is also driving the development of new therapeutic targets [33]. Specific molecular targets like RUNX3 in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) are also being explored to enhance sensitivity to existing drugs like IMiDs  

[29]. Integrating these diverse targets into AT could involve dynamic treatment adjustments based on the observed tumor molecular profile, TME composition, or resistance mechanisms that emerge over time.  

In addition to molecular targets, novel therapeutic modalities, particularly adoptive cell therapies, represent a significant opportunity for adaptive strategies. TCR-T cell therapy is an emerging approach specifically for solid tumors, demonstrating promise by targeting tumor-associated antigens such as PRAME and NY-ESO-1 [9]. This modality shows potential in virusrelated solid tumors, including HBV-related liver cancer and HPV-related cervical cancer [9]. A notable case example of NYESO1-specific TCR-T cell therapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showed a significant reduction in the primary lesion volume, decreasing from  

$9 5 \times 8 6 \times 5 4 \mathrm { { m m } ^ { 3 } }$ to $6 4 \times 4 4 \times 5 4 \mathrm { { m m } ^ { 3 } }$ ,  

representing approximately a $56 \%$ volume reduction [9]. Adoptive T cell therapy, including TIL therapy, leverages the patient's own immune system to target tumor-specific antigens [6,11]. Recent advancements in TIL therapy, such as GC101 and BST02, aim to reduce toxicity by potentially avoiding lymphodepletion or high-dose IL-2 and overcome logistical limitations through cryopreservation [5]. Integrating TCR-T or TIL therapies into AT could involve their use as potent, potentially curative interventions in response to resistance to less intensive therapies, or as part of a sequential or combination strategy modulated by tumor evolution and immune status.  

The integration of these emerging targets and strategies into AT presents both significant opportunities and inherent challenges. Opportunities lie in expanding the therapeutic arsenal, enabling the targeting of previously undruggable pathways, directly addressing resistance mechanisms like USPs, exploiting novel vulnerabilities such as cuproptosis, and deploying highly potent, personalized modalities like TCR-T and TIL therapies. These approaches allow for a more nuanced attack on cancer, potentially overcoming key barriers to treatment success [19]. However, substantial challenges remain. Developing AT models that can effectively incorporate diverse data from these heterogeneous targets and modalities is complex. Predicting tumor evolution and resistance patterns in response to novel agents or cell therapies requires further research. The optimal timing, sequencing, and combination of these emerging therapies within AT frameworks need careful investigation. Furthermore, logistical complexities associated with cell therapies, such as manufacturing and delivery [5], and potential toxicities must be managed within adaptive protocols. A deeper understanding of the dynamic interplay between the tumor, TME, and the activated immune system is crucial for the successful implementation of AT utilizing these advanced strategies.​  

# 5. Monitoring and Guiding Adaptive Therapy  

The successful implementation of adaptive therapy (AT) in oncology critically relies on the availability of robust tools for realtime monitoring of tumor dynamics and treatment response. Such monitoring is essential for informing dynamic adjustments to therapeutic regimens, thereby optimizing outcomes while potentially mitigating resistance and toxicity. A primary requirement for these strategies is the identification and validation of biomarkers that can accurately reflect the evolving tumor landscape and predict treatment efficacy or resistance [15,26].​  

![](images/f17473d05bb2e6788e006adc6b135c407186207853781d5cf8414ed195c2c76e.jpg)  

Various types of biomarkers are utilized to guide adaptive decisions, each offering unique insights. Circulating biomarkers, obtained via minimally invasive liquid biopsies, are particularly valuable for frequent monitoring, providing accessible information on tumor-specific alterations and systemic changes [15,32]. These include circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and other analytes like proteins or metabolites [15,20]. For instance, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are employed in clinical trials to guide adaptive strategies in prostate cancer [1,7,13]. Epigenetic biomarkers also show promise for assessing treatment efficacy and identifying prognosis [26], as do markers related to copper homeostasis which can indicate cancer progression [34]. While advantageous for their non-invasiveness, circulating biomarkers may not fully capture spatial heterogeneity within tumors. In contrast, tissue biopsies offer a direct assessment of the tumor microenvironment and cellular characteristics, providing detailed molecular and cellular information, including somatic mutations, gene expression, and protein profiles [15,20,29]. Characterization of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including specific immune cell populations, is crucial for understanding adaptive immune resistance and predicting immunotherapy response [11,17]. However, their invasive nature limits the frequency of tissue sampling. Imaging biomarkers, such as CT, PET, and MRI, provide macroscopic, spatial information on tumor size, location, and metabolic activity, offering a non-invasive way to visualize tumor burden and anatomical changes [1,5,9,13]. These modalities complement molecular data by providing spatial context but typically offer lower resolution and are subject to limitations in frequency. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) also contribute to evaluating treatment effects [16].  

Among circulating biomarkers, the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) using ctDNA has emerged as a particularly significant application for guiding adaptive therapy, offering potential advantages over traditional surveillance methods [20]. ctDNA analysis facilitates dynamic, longitudinal monitoring and can capture tumor-specific genetic alterations from multiple lesions, addressing limitations posed by spatial heterogeneity observed in single tissue biopsies [15,32]. ctDNAbased MRD detection is increasingly used in solid tumors for assessing treatment response, evaluating prognosis, and determining recurrence risk [20]. Its status is a strong prognostic indicator, consistently associated with event-free and overall survival across various malignancies [22]. Furthermore, ctDNA-MRD detection directly informs clinical decisionmaking by helping to tailor therapeutic strategies, identify drug resistance mechanisms [20,32], and guide the de-escalation or escalation of therapy based on MRD status, as shown in studies of postoperative adjuvant therapy [3]. Despite its utility, challenges remain in the standardization of ctDNA assays across different technologies like qPCR, ddPCR, and NGS [20], as well as ensuring sufficient sensitivity for detecting the low levels characteristic of MRD [22]. Efforts are underway to enhance assay standardization, including regulatory initiatives such as the FDA's pilot program for laboratory-developed tests [33].  

A comprehensive understanding of tumor heterogeneity and the dynamic evolution of resistance mechanisms, crucial for effective AT, is increasingly achieved through the integration of multi-omics data. Technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enable the deconvolution of complex tumor ecosystems by analyzing individual cells, revealing distinct subpopulations, gene expression programs, and insights into the TME [4,19]. Combining scRNA-seq with other modalities like whole exome sequencing (WES) provides a higher-resolution view of tumor dynamics and clonal evolution [29]. Specialized computational tools, such as scCURE, are being developed to leverage scRNA-seq data specifically for understanding immunotherapy response and identifying predictive factors by differentiating therapy-affected cells from unchanged ones [17]. Analysis of baseline profiles of immune cell types in the TME using scRNA-seq has shown potential for predicting immunotherapy response [17]. This integration of multi-omics data, particularly single-cell analyses, holds significant promise for tailoring AT strategies to the specific cellular and molecular landscape of individual tumors, anticipating resistance, and improving personalized treatment outcomes [17]. Other omics data like cfDNA methylomes may also contribute to early detection and classification, further enhancing the multi-omics approach [20]. Ultimately, the effective guidance of adaptive therapy necessitates the integration of information from diverse monitoring modalities to provide a holistic view of the disease.​  

# 5.1 Biomarkers for Guiding Decisions (Circulating, Tissue, Imaging)  

Adaptive therapy in oncology necessitates real-time monitoring of tumor evolution and treatment response to inform dynamic adjustments to therapeutic strategies. This requires the identification and validation of robust biomarkers capable of reflecting the continually changing landscape of both the tumor and its microenvironment. Various types of biomarkers, including circulating, tissue-based, and imaging modalities, offer distinct advantages and face unique challenges in this context.​  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Biomarker Type</td><td>Advantages</td><td>Challenges / Limitations</td><td>Role in Guiding AT</td></tr><tr><td>Circulating</td><td>Minimally invasive, Frequent sampling, Longitudinal.</td><td>May not capture spatial heterogeneity, Standardization issues.</td><td>Dynamic monitoring, Tracking response, Detecting resistance, MRD assessment.</td></tr><tr><td>Tissue</td><td>Direct assessment of tumor/TME, Detailed molecular.</td><td>Invasive, Limited frequency, Single site (spatial heterogeneity).</td><td>Initial diagnosis/profiling, Detailed resistance mechanism analysis.</td></tr><tr><td>Imaging</td><td>Non-invasive, Spatial/Macroscopic view of tumor burden.</td><td>Lower resolution, Limited frequency, Doesn't show molecular details.</td><td>Assessing overall tumor size/response, Identifying location/extent of disease.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Circulating biomarkers, accessible through minimally invasive liquid biopsies, are particularly appealing for frequent monitoring in adaptive therapy [32]. These include circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor RNA (ctRNA), exosomes, proteins, and metabolites [15,20]. Specific molecular alterations, such as somatic point mutations, deletions, amplifications, gene fusions, or methylation markers, can be detected in these circulating components [20]. For instance, monitoring KRAS mutations in ctDNA from patient plasma has been demonstrated during anti‑EGFR therapy for colorectal cancer, revealing dynamic changes in mutant allele levels correlating with treatment pressure and subsequent sensitivity upon drug re‑administration [1]. Similarly, prostate‑specific antigen (PSA) levels in  

blood are utilized in adaptive approaches for prostate cancer treatment, guiding decisions on drug administration or withdrawal [7,13]. In hematologic malignancies, minimal residual disease (MRD), often assessed through molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for gene rearrangements (e.g., IgH VDJ, TCR) or fusion transcripts (e.g., BCR‑ABL), or through immunophenotypic approaches like multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC), serves as a critical circulating or bone marrow‑based biomarker for prognosis and treatment response [22]. Although molecular and immunophenotypic MRD assessments often correlate, differences in sensitivity and potential analytical variability pose challenges for interpretation [22]. The primary advantage of circulating biomarkers lies in their non‑invasive nature and potential for frequent sampling, enabling relatively high‑resolution temporal tracking of tumor dynamics. However, they may not fully capture the spatial heterogeneity within the primary tumor or metastatic sites.​  

Tissue biomarkers, typically obtained via biopsies, provide a direct assessment of the tumor microenvironment and cellular characteristics. These encompass somatic mutations, gene expression profiles, copy number alterations [29], protein expression, and methylation patterns [15,20]. Specific tissue‑based markers, such as DOK7, GDF15, TMEFF2, and VIM, have shown potential for cancer detection and recurrence prediction, while PHLPP2 expression has been linked to survival in pancreatic cancer [26]. Furthermore, analysis of the tumor microenvironment can identify specific immune cell populations, such as $\mathsf { C D 8 + }$ T cells and macrophages, as potential predictive biomarkers for response to immunotherapy based on their baseline profiles [17]. Tissue biopsies offer detailed molecular and cellular information directly from the tumor site, providing insights into local heterogeneity and microenvironmental interactions. However, the invasive nature of biopsies limits their frequency, making them less suitable for continuous real‑time monitoring compared to circulating biomarkers.  

Imaging biomarkers provide macroscopic and spatial information about tumor size, location, and metabolic activity. Radiographic imaging modalities like computed tomography (CT) scans are commonly used to assess tumor regression in various cancers, including lung and colorectal cancer [5,13]. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans can assess metabolic response, as shown in melanoma patients treated with TIL therapy [5]. Imaging offers a non‑invasive way to visualize tumor burden and anatomical changes, providing a spatial context for treatment response. However, imaging typically provides information at a lower resolution than molecular biomarkers and may not detect early molecular changes or capture intra‑tumor heterogeneity at a genetic or cellular level. The frequency of imaging scans is also limited by cost, patient factors, and radiation exposure.​  

A significant challenge in adaptive therapy is developing and validating biomarkers that accurately predict dynamic tumor responses and the evolution of resistance. Tumor evolution is a complex, ongoing process driven by selective pressures, leading to intra‑tumor heterogeneity and the emergence of resistant clones. Biomarkers need to capture this dynamism, identifying not just static predictors but indicators of evolutionary trajectory. This requires understanding complex molecular pathways, cellular interactions, and the interplay between different subclones. Validating these dynamic biomarkers in clinical trials presents challenges, necessitating study designs that can accommodate the fluid nature of adaptive treatment strategies [13]. Overcoming analytical variability and ensuring consistent sensitivity across different methods and samples, particularly for low‑abundance analytes like ctDNA or MRD markers, remains crucial for reliable interpretation [22]. Ultimately, the integration of information from circulating, tissue, and imaging biomarkers is likely essential for developing comprehensive models capable of predicting and guiding adaptive therapeutic interventions effectively.  

# 5.2 ctDNA and MRD Detection  

The monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) through circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis represents a significant advancement in oncology, offering potential advantages over traditional methods such as imaging and tissue biopsy for guiding adaptive therapy strategies. Unlike tissue biopsies, ctDNA analysis is non-invasive, making dynamic, longitudinal monitoring feasible [15,32]. Furthermore, ctDNA analysis can capture tumor-specific genetic alterations from multiple lesions simultaneously, thereby potentially overcoming limitations posed by tumor heterogeneity inherent in single-site tissue biopsies [15].  

![](images/0e15be58c988f2968960fd097be1b16636e0d518136281500d6de6a599d0c939.jpg)  

ctDNA-based MRD detection has emerged as a crucial tool for clinical decision-making across various solid tumors, including lung, breast, and colon cancers [20]. Its clinical applications span several critical areas. MRD detection aids in assessing treatment response, evaluating patient prognosis, and determining the risk of recurrence [20]. For post-operative patients, both single-point and dynamic multi-point ctDNA monitoring demonstrate strong predictive value for recurrence risk and can stratify patients for appropriate treatment decisions [15]. Early detection of tumor metastasis and recurrence is vital for improving survival outcomes, and ctDNA analysis can help identify early-stage cancer and predict recurrence in patients with early-stage disease [20].​  

MRD status is recognized as a significant prognostic indicator [20]. A meta-analysis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) provides robust evidence for the strong association between MRD status and clinical outcomes, consistent across various therapeutic approaches, assessment methods, and time points [22]. Achieving MRD negativity was consistently associated with significantly better event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in both pediatric and adult patients [22]. For instance, estimated 10-year EFS for pediatric patients was $7 7 \%$ with MRD negativity versus approximately $3 2 \%$ with positive MRD, and for adults, it was approximately $6 4 \%$ versus $2 1 \%$ respectively [22]. Similarly, in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT), those who achieved ctDNA-MRD negativity within 4 months post-CRT exhibited a favorable prognosis, with a 2-year progression-free survival rate as high as $8 8 . 4 \%$ [3].  

The utility of ctDNA-MRD detection extends to guiding adaptive therapy protocols. By monitoring patients' responses during and after treatment, ctDNA helps tailor therapeutic strategies [20]. It can aid in the precise selection of treatment approaches and deepen the understanding of drug resistance mechanisms, thereby offering opportunities for precision medication and overcoming resistance [20,32]. A key application in adaptive therapy is demonstrated in NSCLC post-CRT: consolidated immunotherapy provided benefit only to ctDNA-MRD-positive patients, while MRD-negative patients did not benefit and experienced serious treatment-related adverse reactions [3]. This highlights the potential of using ctDNA-MRD status to guide the de-escalation or escalation of therapy.​  

Despite its significant potential, challenges remain in the widespread adoption of ctDNA-based MRD detection. A major challenge lies in the standardization of ctDNA assays. Various detection techniques are currently employed, including quantitative PCR (qPCR), digital PCR (ddPCR), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) [20]. The variability in methodologies, sensitivity, and cutoff thresholds across platforms and laboratories necessitates standardization to ensure reliable and comparable results [22]. Furthermore, increasing the sensitivity of ctDNA assays is crucial, particularly for detecting the extremely low levels of circulating tumor DNA present in minimal residual disease, which is essential for accurate early detection of recurrence and treatment monitoring.  

# 5.3 Integration of Multi-Omics Data (e.g., scRNA-seq)  

Understanding the intricate heterogeneity and dynamic evolution of tumors is paramount for the successful implementation and adaptation of therapeutic strategies, particularly in the context of adaptive therapy (AT). Integrating multi-omics data streams provides a comprehensive view that can enhance the understanding of tumor dynamics and the emergence of resistance mechanisms during treatment. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) stands out as a powerful tool in this regard, enabling the deconvolution of complex tumor ecosystems by analyzing the transcriptomic profiles of individual cells [4,19]. This granular resolution allows for the identification of distinct cell subpopulations, the characterization of their specific gene expression programs, and the detailed investigation of the tumor microenvironment (TME) [19].  

The integration of scRNA-seq with other omics modalities, such as whole exome sequencing (WES), has proven effective in deciphering tumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution. For instance, combining WES and scRNA-seq data has facilitated the identification of distinct subpopulations and their associated gene regulatory networks in multiple myeloma, providing insights into tumor evolution at a higher resolution than bulk sequencing alone [29]. By analyzing the heterogeneous states of tumor, stromal, and immune cells separately using approaches like scRNA-seq or single-cell proteomics, researchers can uncover novel therapeutic vulnerabilities and resistance pathways [4]. Furthermore, scRNA-seq, sometimes combined with techniques like multispectral imaging, is being utilized to immunophenotype the TME, as demonstrated in studies investigating conditions like PDAC-induced cachexia [31].  

Beyond general analysis, specialized computational tools are being developed to leverage scRNA-seq data for predicting therapeutic response and tailoring AT strategies. scCURE (single-cell RNA sequencing data-based Changed and Unchanged cell Recognition during immunotherapy) is one such tool designed to analyze scRNA-seq data from samples collected during or after therapy [17]. Utilizing methodologies such as Gaussian mixture modeling, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and mutual nearest-neighbors criteria, scCURE differentiates between cells that have been affected by immunotherapy and those that remain unchanged [17]. Analyses using scCURE on melanoma and breast cancer immunotherapy scRNA-seq datasets have revealed that baseline profiles of specific immune cell types, notably ${ \mathsf { C D 8 + } }$ T cells and macrophages, can serve as predictors for the response of TME immune cells to therapy [17]. This capability highlights the potential of scCURE and similar tools to integrate the study of therapy response mechanisms with the construction of predictive models [17]. By identifying these predictive single-cell characteristics within the tumor and its microenvironment, multi-omics integration, particularly involving scRNA-seq and specialized analysis tools, offers a promising avenue for tailoring AT strategies to the specific cellular landscape of an individual patient's tumor, potentially anticipating and managing resistance during the course of treatment. While other multi-omics data like cfDNA methylomes show promise for early detection and classification [20], the strength of single-cell resolution data lies in dissecting the cellular mechanisms of response and resistance relevant for adaptive treatment decisions.  

# 6. Enabling Technologies and Methodologies  

The successful implementation of adaptive therapy (AT) in oncology is critically dependent on advancements in several enabling technologies and methodologies that facilitate dynamic decision-making and personalized treatment strategies.

This section surveys the pivotal roles of artificial intelligence (AI), nanotechnology, and innovative clinical trial designs in transforming the landscape of cancer treatment towards more flexible and responsive approaches. These tools provide the necessary analytical power, precise intervention delivery, real-time monitoring capabilities, and robust validation frameworks required for AT.​  

Artificial Intelligence is profoundly transforming oncology by enabling sophisticated data analysis, predictive modeling, and the development of personalized treatment algorithms, which are fundamental to AT [13]. AI algorithms excel at processing complex and heterogeneous datasets, encompassing genomic, clinical, and imaging information, to inform adaptive treatment decisions [13,15,25]. Specific AI applications include medical image analysis, pathological assessment, and the bioinformatic interpretation of multi-omics data [15]. Crucially, AI models can predict patient response to therapies by analyzing intricate biological signatures, aiding in identifying patient subsets likely to benefit from specific treatments [19]. Furthermore, AI contributes to optimizing treatment schedules and dosages by forecasting outcomes and analyzing patient data alongside electronic health records to match individuals with suitable clinical trials or personalize existing strategies, thereby enhancing treatment optimization and patient stratification [13,25]. AI also holds potential for real-time therapeutic adaptation by processing dynamic data streams, such as differentiating cellular changes during immunotherapy [17] or guiding surgical tools based on immediate feedback [25]. Despite advancements, challenges remain in reducing the manual effort required for data annotation, although weakly supervised and self-supervised learning are mitigating this [15]. The capacity of AI to integrate diverse data, predict responses, optimize parameters, and facilitate real-time adjustments is central to realizing personalized AT [13].  

Nanotechnology complements AI by improving drug delivery precision and enabling dynamic monitoring of treatment response, both essential for implementing adaptive strategies [25]. Nanocarriers, such as liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, are engineered to achieve selective targeting of cancer cells, reducing systemic toxicity and enhancing therapeutic efficacy compared to traditional chemotherapy [25]. Design principles often involve functionalization and surface modification to improve tumor-specific delivery [25]. Examples include nanoliposomes co-loading synergistic agents [27], multistage delivery systems that adapt based on the biological environment [27], and metabolism-targeting nanoagents like $C u _ { 2 - x } S$ , which combine therapeutic modalities such as photothermal conversion [34]. Beyond delivery, nanotechnology is critical for real-time disease monitoring, enabling theranostic nanoparticles that integrate diagnostic and therapeutic functions [25]. This allows for continuous feedback on treatment response and disease progression, crucial for guiding adaptive adjustments. For instance, nanotechnology facilitates the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), providing insights into metastatic potential and treatment effectiveness [15]. The regulatory recognition of nanotechnologyenabled monitoring systems underscores their growing importance for AT decision-making [15].  

Evaluating dynamic AT protocols necessitates flexible and efficient clinical trial methodologies. Adaptive trial designs and platform trials offer significant advantages over traditional fixed designs by enabling the concurrent evaluation of multiple therapies within a single, dynamic protocol [14]. Key features include response-adaptive randomization, which adjusts patient allocation based on accumulating data, and multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) designs, allowing for simultaneous assessment of several treatments and incorporating interim analyses for early stopping of ineffective arms or incorporation of new ones [14]. These designs align well with the iterative nature of AT. A practical application is seen in biomarker-heavy platform trials that can dynamically add or remove treatment arms based on ongoing biomarker analysis, facilitating the identification of effective strategies within specific patient subgroups [31]. While offering enhanced flexibility and efficiency for testing AT, these designs introduce distinct statistical and logistical challenges. Managing adaptive randomization and valid interim analyses requires sophisticated statistical methodologies, and the dynamic nature of trials, particularly those driven by biomarker adaptation, demands robust infrastructure for real-time data management and rapid decision-making [14,31].​  

In summary, AI provides the analytical engine for understanding complex biological data and predicting responses, nanotechnology offers precise delivery and real-time monitoring capabilities, and adaptive trial designs provide the necessary framework for validating these dynamic AT strategies [13,14,25]. The convergence of these fields holds immense promise for advancing personalized and adaptive cancer care, although overcoming statistical, logistical, and data annotation challenges remains crucial for their widespread clinical adoption. Continued research at the intersection of these disciplines is essential to fully realize the potential of AT in improving patient outcomes.​  

# 6.1 Role of Artificial Intelligence  

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly pivotal in advancing oncology toward more adaptive and personalized therapeutic strategies. AI algorithms demonstrate significant potential in processing complex and heterogeneous data—including genomic, clinical, and imaging information—to inform dynamic treatment decisions [13,15,25]. Specifically, AI techniques facilitate sophisticated analyses such as medical image annotation, pathological assessment, and the bioinformatics interpretation of multi-omics data [15]. Innovations in weakly supervised and selfsupervised learning have substantially reduced the manual effort required for image annotation, thereby accelerating the clinical implementation of AI in cancer care [15].  

![](images/11c83b3de8c45f2364b1beced1775edd4f3d5899dbbf2acae2720bed9e8f36eb.jpg)  

A key application of AI in this context is the prediction of patient response to treatment. Machine learning models can analyze complex biological signatures, such as molecular subtypes, to discriminate patient populations that are likely to exhibit an increased response to specific therapies, including immunotherapies [19]. Beyond predicting initial response, AI contributes to optimizing treatment schedules and regimens. This includes forecasting outcomes such as graft survival and recurrence risk in complex procedures like liver transplantation [25] and refining treatment dosage [13]. Furthermore, AI can analyze patient biomarker data alongside electronic health records to match individuals with the most appropriate clinical trials or to personalize treatment strategies, thereby effectively enhancing treatment optimization and patient stratification [13].​  

AI also holds promise for adapting therapy in real time by processing dynamic data streams. For example, pattern recognition modeling is used to differentiate cellular changes occurring during immunotherapy, providing insights into treatment effectiveness at the single-cell level [17]. In surgical oncology, AI-guided robotic systems utilize real-time imaging data to dynamically adjust surgical tools, enhancing precision and adapting the procedure based on immediate feedback [25]. While these applications may not directly represent systemic adaptive therapy adjustments, they illustrate AI's capacity to enable dynamic, data-driven interventions.  

Ultimately, AI's ability to integrate diverse data types, predict patient-specific responses, optimize treatment parameters, and facilitate real-time adjustments significantly enhances the potential for personalization in adaptive therapy. By moving beyond static treatment protocols and leveraging continuous data analysis, AI empowers clinicians to tailor therapeutic strategies more precisely to individual patient characteristics and evolving tumor dynamics [13]. This personalized approach, driven by AI’s analytical capabilities, is fundamental to realizing the full potential of adaptive strategies in oncology.​  

# 6.2 Role of Nanotechnology in Drug Delivery and Monitoring  

Nanotechnology offers promising avenues to address key challenges in drug delivery and monitoring within oncology, particularly relevant for the implementation of adaptive therapy strategies [25]. Traditional chemotherapy often suffers from poor tumor specificity, leading to systemic toxicity and limited efficacy. Nanocarriers are engineered to overcome these limitations by enabling selective targeting of cancer cells, thereby reducing damage to healthy tissues and enhancing therapeutic effectiveness [25].  

![](images/da30bc2dee65761b7be7adf3c2db51114342332375e3213b9f8999558e06a97e.jpg)  

Various types of nanoparticles serve as drug delivery vehicles, including liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, which facilitate the direct delivery of therapeutic agents to tumors [25]. This targeted approach can improve drug bioavailability and overcome barriers inherent in conventional drug administration [25]. Design principles for these nanocarriers often involve functionalization to enhance targeting specificity towards the tumor microenvironment [25], such as the liver cancer microenvironment. Surface modification techniques are also employed to improve selective tumor delivery of agents like Cu-based nanoagents [34].​  

Specific examples illustrate the versatility of nanocarrier design for enhanced therapy. Nanoliposomes have been utilized to co-load synergistic agents, such as adriamycin and baicalin, demonstrating a stronger inhibitory effect on breast cancer cells compared to single-agent delivery [27]. Multistage drug delivery systems, for instance, utilizing curcumin (CUR), can be designed to intelligently alter their size and surface charge to optimize delivery at different biological barriers, enhancing overall anticancer activity [27]. Curcumin-loaded hyaluronic acid/chitosan nanoparticles (Cur-PENPs) have shown increased absorption efficiency and cytotoxicity against C6 glioma cells, highlighting the potential for improved drug uptake and efficacy [27]. Furthermore, metabolism-targeting $\mathit { C u } _ { 2 - x } \mathit { S }$ (MACuS) nanoagents leverage synthetic chemistry and surface modification to combine therapeutic modalities, such as Fenton-like reactions and photothermal conversion, for effective treatment [34].​  

Beyond delivery, nanotechnology plays a critical role in monitoring disease status, which is essential for guiding adaptive treatment adjustments. Theranostic nanoparticles represent a key development, integrating both diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities into a single platform, enabling personalized and adaptive strategies [25]. Real-time monitoring enabled by nanotechnology provides crucial feedback on treatment response and disease progression. For example, nanotechnology facilitates the detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), providing insights into metastatic potential and treatment effectiveness. The TumorFisher CTC detection system, using nanomagnetic beads combined with molecular beacon technology, allows for the detection of specific RNA markers like CLDN18.2 RNA in CTCs from gastric cancer patients [15]. The recognition of CTC detection products by regulatory bodies, such as the FDA granting "breakthrough medical device" designation for early breast and prostate cancer detection products, underscores the growing importance and potential of nanotechnology-enabled monitoring for adaptive treatment decision-making [15]. By providing timely and precise information, nanotechnology-based monitoring supports the dynamic adjustments required for successful adaptive therapy.​  

# 6.3 Adaptive Trial Designs and Platform Trials  

Traditional clinical trial designs, such as the standard randomized controlled trial (RCT) design exemplified by studies evaluating fixed interventions like structured exercise programs [16], may prove less suitable for the evaluation of dynamic adaptive therapy (AT) strategies in oncology. AT protocols are inherently characterized by their dynamic nature, involving adjustments to treatment based on real‐time patient response and disease evolution. Evaluating such fluid strategies requires trial methodologies that offer greater flexibility than conventional designs, which typically evaluate a single intervention or a fixed set of interventions over a predetermined period.  

![](images/f8c62fbb9902e887250ed968d2961424fa9c71413cb70488878df715132bec8b.jpg)  

Adaptive designs and platform trials represent advanced methodologies that offer enhanced flexibility and efficiency for testing diverse AT protocols and identifying effective strategies [14]. These designs enable the concurrent evaluation of multiple therapies or strategies within a single overarching protocol, contrasting with the sequential nature often required by traditional approaches [14]. Key components facilitating this flexibility include response‐adaptive randomization, where patient allocation is adjusted based on accumulating efficacy or toxicity data, and multi‐arm, multi‐stage designs, which permit the simultaneous assessment of several treatments alongside opportunities for interim analyses and protocol modifications [14]. This structure allows for the early discontinuation of ineffective arms and the potential incorporation of new treatments, aligning well with the iterative nature of AT.​  

A practical application of such designs in oncology is seen in biomarker‐heavy clinical trials utilizing multi‐arm Platform designs [31]. These trials can dynamically add or remove treatment arms based on ongoing biomarker analysis, facilitating the identification of effective strategies within specific patient subgroups [31]. This adaptive capacity allows researchers to efficiently explore multiple therapeutic hypotheses and tailor the investigation based on emerging biological and clinical evidence, which is crucial for optimizing AT approaches that often rely on predictive or prognostic markers.​  

Implementing these adaptive and platform trial designs in oncology, while offering significant advantages, also presents distinct statistical and logistical challenges. Statistically, managing adaptive randomization and conducting valid interim analyses within multi‐arm, multi‐stage frameworks requires sophisticated statistical methodologies to ensure the integrity and interpretability of the results [14]. Maintaining statistical power, controlling Type I error rates, and accounting for the potential biases introduced by adaptation are critical considerations. Logistically, the dynamic nature of these trials, particularly those incorporating biomarker‐driven adaptation and the potential for adding or closing study arms [31], necessitates robust infrastructure for real‐time data collection, monitoring, and rapid decision‐making. The coordination across multiple sites, the management of drug supply for various potential arms, and the complex operational procedures for dynamic allocation and protocol amendments introduce considerable logistical complexity compared to fixed‐design trials.​  

# 7. Challenges and Future Directions  

Translating adaptive therapy (AT) from theoretical concepts and controlled research settings into widespread routine clinical practice faces substantial challenges [7,25]. A primary hurdle is the profound complexity and heterogeneity of tumor biology, which encompasses intricate signaling networks, inter- and intra-tumoral variation, and diverse genetic landscapes across and within different cancers [19,26,32,33]. This complexity complicates the accurate parameterization and clinical translation of mathematical models necessary for predicting tumor evolution and optimizing dynamic dosing strategies [1,12]. Technical difficulties also persist in areas such as specifically targeting discrete persistent cancer cells (PCCs) [8], overcoming resistance mechanisms in therapies like immunotherapy or targeted agents [4,11,23,32], and implementing cellbased therapies like TIL therapy which require specialized processing and management of toxicity [5,6]. Even nonpharmacological interventions face logistical challenges in real-world implementation [16]. Furthermore, developing standardized, yet personalized, protocols is difficult due to the need to tailor approaches to individual patient and tumor characteristics and integrate multi-modal data [3,29]. Standardization of monitoring metrics, such as minimal residual disease (MRD), also presents technical and interpretive challenges [22]. Limitations in current clinical trial methodologies, including operational biases and statistical complexities in adaptive designs, necessitate novel evaluation frameworks capable of robustly assessing dynamic therapies [14].  

![](images/8bf95cdee5d4007903ce45ab60fbf75cccccd9434f6641cc4b1184b0b5d44811.jpg)  

Addressing these challenges necessitates significant advancements in monitoring technologies, the validation of predictive biomarkers, and the development of more robust mathematical models [1]. Improved monitoring requires more sensitive and standardized assays for disease burden like MRD, non-invasive methods for tracking drug response and resistance [20,22,32], and integration of real-time data streams facilitated by technologies like nanotechnology and AI [25]. Validated predictive biomarkers are crucial for identifying patients most likely to benefit from AT and specific combinations, requiring better understanding of tumor microenvironment (TME) signatures and individual molecular features [3,6,31]. More robust mathematical models must better reflect tumor heterogeneity and evolutionary dynamics, incorporating additional cellular components and undergoing rigorous clinical validation [1,12].  

Regulatory and ethical considerations are paramount for the successful integration of AT into practice [7,25]. The dynamic nature of AT, particularly its focus on tumor control rather than immediate eradication [7], challenges traditional regulatory paradigms based on fixed regimens and endpoints like progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). Evaluating efficacy using non-conventional metrics, such as MRD, requires careful validation and consideration of how they predict long-term clinical benefit [22]. Ethically, the shift towards non-curative control necessitates open discussions about patient expectations, understanding, and acceptance of fluctuating treatment plans and potential treatment holidays [7]. Ensuring informed consent for dynamic regimens and protecting patient data privacy in the context of complex monitoring and data integration are critical aspects [25].  

Future research directions are diverse and interconnected, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and technological advancements. Key areas include a deeper mechanistic understanding of resistance, encompassing drug resistance in primary and metastatic sites [18,32], immunotherapy resistance mechanisms (including adaptive immune resistance within the TME) [11,23,30], persistence mechanisms of cancer cells [8], and resistance specific to cancer types or therapies like endocrine resistance or GBM therapy resistance [10,19]. Research is needed to develop and refine predictive tools and monitoring technologies, including AI-driven platforms, single-cell analysis, and the integration of multi-omics data to personalize treatment [13,17,25]. Developing novel therapeutic strategies and combinations is essential, focusing on more effective drugs, combinations to suppress pathways, enhancing biological therapies (TIL, antibodies, CAR T, vaccines), and exploring novel agents with improved specificity (e.g., targeted copper ion delivery, specific DNMT inhibitors) [5,6,26,32,33,34]. Validating these strategies, along with adjunctive therapies like exercise or Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), in preclinical and clinical settings is paramount [16,27,29]. Achieving these goals requires robust collaboration among academic institutions, industry, and regulatory bodies to facilitate complex research efforts, including adaptive platform trials [1,14]. Ultimately, these advancements aim to transform cancer treatment into a more precise, personalized, and manageable approach for patients [11,19,25,33].​  

# 7.1 Current Challenges in Implementation and Validation  

Translating the principles of adaptive therapy (AT) from theoretical models and controlled research settings into routine clinical practice presents significant logistical and technical challenges.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Category</td><td>Specific Challenges</td></tr><tr><td>Tumor Biology</td><td>Complexity of signaling networks,Inter/Intra- tumoral heterogeneity, Genetic diversity, Accurate model parameterization.</td></tr><tr><td>Technical</td><td>Targeting persistent cancer cells (PCCs), Overcoming specific therapy resistance (immuno,targeted),Implementing cell</td></tr></table></body></html>

A primary technical difficulty arises from the inherent complexity of tumor biology, including the intricate networks of interconnected signaling pathways, substantial inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity, and the multitude of genetic mutations present in diverse cancers [19,32]. This biological complexity complicates the identification of pure "oncogene addiction" and makes it difficult to obtain accurate parameter values necessary for mathematical modeling, as these values vary considerably between cancer types, patients, and even within individual tumors [12]. Consequently, translating mathematical models developed in research to real-world clinical applications remains challenging [12]. Furthermore, the difficulty in detecting and specifically targeting discrete, often undetected, persistent cancer cells poses another significant technical hurdle to achieving durable responses with therapy [8].​  

Beyond general tumor complexity, specific therapeutic modalities face unique implementation challenges. For instance, broadening the clinical applicability of cancer immunotherapies necessitates a deeper understanding of the mechanisms limiting their effectiveness and the ability to overcome immunosuppressive factors [19,23]. Therapies like TIL therapy encounter technical difficulties in isolating and expanding sufficient numbers of TILs and require specialized facilities for processing and administration. Additionally, traditional approaches involving lymphodepletion and IL-2 administration carry risks of significant toxicity [5,6]. Even non-pharmacological interventions like structured exercise programs for metastatic breast cancer patients face logistical challenges in real-world implementation, requiring dedicated resources for supervision, personalization, and continuous monitoring [16]. Pharmacological approaches such as HDAC inhibitors also encounter challenges, including drug resistance and the need for careful management of side effects, requiring diligent patient adherence to tailored medical advice [26].​  

Developing standardized protocols for AT is complicated by the need for personalized approaches tailored to individual patient and tumor characteristics. Translating findings from highly controlled single-patient studies to broader clinical applications remains difficult [29]. This necessitates more comprehensive data integration and sophisticated analysis to guide personalized therapy decisions [29]. Standardizing the interpretation of clinical endpoints, such as minimal residual disease (MRD), across heterogeneous studies, treatment regimens, and individual patients has also proven challenging, limiting the widespread adoption of MRD as a consistent measure [22]. Overcoming the technical and logistical complexities and implementing adaptive strategies effectively in diverse clinical settings also requires significant clinician education and buy-in to ensure appropriate application and monitoring.​  

Furthermore, current clinical trial methodologies face limitations in adequately assessing AT strategies. While adaptive designs, such as response-adaptive randomization (RAR), can potentially reduce exposure to less effective treatments and decrease study costs and duration, they introduce operational biases, such as patients potentially delaying participation to increase their chance of receiving a seemingly more effective therapy [14]. Current statistical methods, including Bayesian approaches often used in adaptive trials, may also have limitations in accurately assessing and controlling statistical biases in complex trial environments, highlighting the need for innovative statistical methods and analytical tools [14]. These limitations underscore the need for novel clinical trial designs and evaluation frameworks capable of robustly assessing the unique benefits and risks of dynamic, adaptive therapeutic approaches.​  

# 7.2 Personalizing Adaptive Therapy  

Personalization is increasingly recognized as a critical component for maximizing the therapeutic efficacy and clinical benefits of adaptive therapy (AT) in oncology [13]. This approach tailors treatment strategies to the unique biological landscape of each patient's tumor and their individual response dynamics, moving beyond one-size-fits-all protocols [1]. Understanding the dynamic and evolving nature of interactions between the immune system and cancer cells, as well as individual tumor dependencies and resistance mechanisms, underscores the necessity of personalizing treatment regimens accordingly [23,32]. Evidence strongly supports the implementation of personalized combinatorial therapies, which account for the varied individual characteristics of patients and their tumors [19].  

A cornerstone of personalizing AT lies in the integration of multi-modal data to predict individual tumor evolution and optimize patient-specific regimens. Diverse data types, such as genomic aberrations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, tumor-specific mutations, cellular profiles (e.g., specific ${ \mathsf { C D } } 8 +$ T cells and macrophages), protein expressions, and tumor microenvironment characteristics, provide crucial insights into individual tumor biology and potential treatment responses [6,17,25,33]. Analyzing personal omics data through high-throughput sequencing can reveal specific genetic compositions and molecular phenotypes, guiding the selection of individualized targeted medications and identifying potential personal therapeutic targets [29]. For instance, identifying tumor-specific mutations is vital for selecting tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) capable of effectively targeting these mutations in personalized immunotherapy approaches [6]. Similarly, scCURE contributes to personalized immunotherapy by identifying specific cellular populations whose baseline profiles can predict treatment response in individual patients [17].  

Artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced analytics play a pivotal role in facilitating personalized AT approaches by enabling the integration and interpretation of complex multi-modal data. AI can analyze vast amounts of patient-specific data, including genetic mutations, protein expressions, and tumor microenvironment characteristics, to design highly tailored therapeutic solutions, such as personalized nanosystems for targeted drug delivery [25]. Predictive algorithms, informed by tumor characteristics, can also aid clinicians in anticipating treatment response to therapies like radiation before extensive data collection, thereby supporting the personalization of treatment strategies [12]. By leveraging these advanced computational tools, researchers and clinicians can move towards truly individualized adaptive strategies that continuously evolve based on real-time patient data and predicted tumor dynamics.  

# 7.3 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  

Adaptive therapy (AT) presents unique challenges to regulatory approval processes that are fundamentally designed for fixed-dose treatment regimens. A key aspect of this difficulty lies in the evaluation of treatment efficacy using metrics that differ from traditional endpoints like progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). For instance, utilizing minimal residual disease (MRD) as a primary endpoint for accelerated drug approval—while potentially indicative of initial response— necessitates a clear plan for subsequent confirmation of benefit on more conventional endpoints such as event-free survival (EFS) or OS [22]. This requirement highlights the regulatory system's emphasis on established measures of long-term clinical benefit, which may not perfectly align with AT strategies that focus on dynamic tumor control and resistance management rather than immediate maximal reduction. Navigating approval for adaptive strategies requires either demonstrating clinical benefit within existing frameworks or advocating for adapted evaluation criteria that account for the dynamic nature and potentially different long-term goals of these therapies.  

Beyond regulatory hurdles, AT introduces significant ethical considerations, particularly regarding its goal of tumor control rather than eradication [7]. This paradigm shift challenges the deeply ingrained clinical objective of achieving complete remission or cure, potentially impacting patient expectations and perceptions of treatment success. Ethical discussions must address whether pursuing long-term, non-curative control—which may involve planned periods without active therapy or dose adjustments—is ethically justifiable, especially when potentially curative fixed regimens exist. Concerns also arise regarding patient understanding and acceptance of dynamic treatment plans. Unlike static schedules, AT requires patients to comprehend and consent to a treatment approach that will change based on ongoing monitoring of their disease. This necessitates clear and transparent communication about the rationale behind dose modifications, treatment holidays, the goal of therapy (control vs. eradication), and potential fluctuations in disease markers. Ensuring informed consent and managing patient anxiety related to dynamic changes and the potential for sub-maximal treatment requires dedicated efforts in patient education and shared decision-making to foster trust and adherence to these novel therapeutic strategies.  

# 7.4 Future Research Avenues  

Advancing adaptive therapy (AT) in oncology necessitates focused research across multiple critical domains, demanding collaborative efforts and holding significant potential to revolutionize cancer treatment and patient outcomes. A primary research direction involves deepening the understanding of cancer resistance mechanisms. This includes exploring the processes regulating drug resistance in primary tumors, pre-metastatic niches, and overt metastases to identify novel  

therapeutic avenues [18]. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to targeted therapies and immunotherapies is crucial [23,32], alongside understanding the epigenetic, transcriptional, and translational regulatory processes contributing to the persistence of cancer cells [8]. Specific attention is needed to elucidate resistance in particular cancer types, such as the mechanisms of endocrine resistance [10] and therapy-resistant mechanisms in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) [19]. A critical area is the identification and targeting of adaptive immune resistance (AIR) mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment (TME) [11,30]. Dissecting the complete tumor ecosystem is essential for an adaptive understanding of TME responses to treatment-induced stress [4], with future efforts focusing on understanding the local environment of specific cancers like pancreatic cancer to enhance immunotherapy efficacy [28].  

The development and refinement of predictive models and monitoring tools represent another vital research frontier. This involves building models that accurately reflect the complexities of tumor evolution [1]. Applying mathematical algorithms to clinical studies and refining models to incorporate tumor heterogeneity are necessary steps towards optimizing treatment plans [12]. Advancements in monitoring include developing more sensitive and standardized assessments of minimal residual disease (MRD) as a continuous measure of disease burden [22], and creating non-invasive assays for effectively monitoring drug response and the emergence of resistance [32]. The increasing utility of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in various clinical contexts highlights its potential as a monitoring tool [20], suggesting further research into its integration into AT strategies. Developing TME signatures for patient stratification is also a promising direction [31]. Technological advancements, particularly the convergence of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence (AI), are poised to enable real-time monitoring of nanoparticle biodistribution and adaptive therapy adjustments, solidifying AI's role in precision oncology [25]. Further assessment of AI platforms, such as CURATE.AI, in larger patient cohorts and with additional disease markers is warranted [13]. Single-cell analysis platforms like scCURE require expanded application to other cancer types and integration with multi-omics data for a more comprehensive understanding of the TME and therapy response [17].​  

Translational research focusing on novel therapeutic strategies and combinations is paramount. This includes developing drugs and combinations capable of fully suppressing oncogenic signaling pathways [32]. Research into enhancing the specificity and accessibility of biological therapies, such as modifications to bispecific antibodies and CAR T-cells, advancements in oncolytic viruses, bolstering cancer vaccine immunogenicity, and identifying new therapeutic targets, is critical [33]. Developing strategies to enhance the specificity and minimize off-target effects of novel agents like copper ion delivery, potentially through intracellular targeting, gene therapies, or nanotechnology, is crucial [34]. Non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors with enhanced specificity are under investigation [26]. Combination therapies, particularly integrating therapies like TIL therapy with PD-1 inhibitors, gene editing technologies, or other immunotherapies, are key to creating more precise and effective strategies [5,6]. Identifying predictive biomarkers is necessary to select patients most likely to benefit from such combinations, while also developing strategies to enhance TIL cell infiltration and activity [6]. Research validating identified therapeutic targets and adaptive/recycle therapy strategies in preclinical and clinical studies is also essential [29]. Furthermore, exploring adjunctive therapies such as exercise requires identifying specific patient subgroups, optimizing protocols, and investigating underlying mechanisms [16]. Research into Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) should focus on identifying active components, exploring molecular mechanisms, and conducting rigorous clinical trials [27].​

Achieving these research goals necessitates robust collaboration among government bodies, pharmaceutical industries, and clinical research institutions to ensure the efficient execution of complex studies such as adaptive platform trials [14]. Collaborative efforts are crucial for integrating diverse expertise, sharing data, and accelerating the translation of basic science findings into clinical practice.  

Ultimately, these future research efforts are poised to significantly impact cancer treatment by providing a deeper mechanistic understanding of tumor biology and resistance, developing sophisticated predictive and monitoring tools, and creating more effective and personalized therapeutic strategies. This multifaceted approach, driven by interdisciplinary collaboration, holds the promise of transforming cancer into a manageable disease for a greater number of patients, leading to improved prognoses and enhanced patient outcomes [11,19,25,33].  

# 8. Conclusion  

This survey has summarized the scientific rationale, diverse strategies, and clinical progress underpinning adaptive therapy (AT) in oncology. Fundamentally rooted in understanding tumor evolution based on Darwinian dynamics and applying ecological principles, AT represents a paradigm shift from traditional eradication-focused approaches to strategies aimed at controlling tumor populations and managing the emergence of resistance [1,7]. The scientific rationale is strongly supported by insights into the adaptive responses of cancer cells under therapeutic pressure, including mechanisms driving resistance in targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and other modalities [4,23,32]. Targeting these adaptive responses and stress-mediated pathways presents significant opportunities to impact cancer cell survival and prevent the development of treatment-refractory clones [4].​  

Diverse strategies are being explored to implement AT principles. These encompass not only adjusting conventional treatment schedules but also developing novel approaches and integrating advanced technologies. Biological therapies, which harness the body's immune system to target cancer cells, are experiencing rapid market growth and offer targeted ways to enhance disease control [33]. Advanced technologies like Artificial intelligence (AI) and nanotechnology are poised to transform cancer therapy by enabling more precise, individualized, and efficient treatment processes, particularly in complex settings like liver cancer [25]. AI's potential lies in integrating diverse data types to customize treatment strategies and improve personalized care, requiring seamless implementation across discovery, development, and clinical use [13]. Furthermore, translational research is increasingly considering the interplay between cancer cells, the tumor microenvironment, and systemic factors like the immune and hormonal systems to identify new therapeutic targets and approaches against drug-resistant cells [18].  

Clinical progress in areas like TCR-T and TIL therapy demonstrates the potential for significant advancements in solid tumor treatment by leveraging immune responses, offering hope for patients who have failed other treatments and potentially leading to long-term survival [6,9]. The increasing recognition of minimal residual disease (MRD) as a crucial indicator of therapeutic benefit and its utility in guiding clinical decision-making and drug development further highlights the move towards more adaptive and monitoring-driven strategies [20,22]. For specific contexts like advanced NSCLC, adaptive strategies involve individualized treatment adjustments based on patient characteristics to enhance efficacy and mitigate side effects [3].​  

Adaptive therapy holds significant potential to improve patient outcomes, particularly in overcoming the challenge of drug resistance which remains a major cause of treatment failure [7,8]. By managing tumor evolution rather than solely pursuing eradication, AT seeks to maintain disease control while minimizing the selective pressure that drives the outgrowth of highly resistant clones [7]. Furthermore, individualized and adjusted treatment strategies inherent in AT approaches may contribute to reduced toxicity compared to continuous maximum tolerated dose regimens, thereby potentially improving patients' quality of life.​  

To fully realize the promise of adaptive therapy in oncology, continued robust research is essential to deepen our understanding of tumor evolutionary dynamics, resistance mechanisms, and the complex interactions within the tumor ecosystem [23]. This includes dissecting the intricacies of adaptive immune resistance and identifying strategies to  

overcome these barriers [11,30]. Alongside research, significant technological development is required, particularly in advanced monitoring techniques like liquid biopsies (e.g., ctDNA) and single-cell analysis to track tumor evolution in realtime, as well as in AI-driven predictive modeling and treatment optimization algorithms [12,17,20]. Finally, concerted clinical implementation efforts, including well-designed researcher-initiated clinical studies exploring novel AT regimens, are crucial to translate theoretical principles and preclinical findings into practical, effective treatments that benefit patients [1].​
