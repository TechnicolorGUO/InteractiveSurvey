# Abstract  

The literature review is an indispensable step in the research process. It provides the benefit of comprehending the research problem and understanding the current research situation while conducting a comparative analysis of prior works. However, literature summary is challenging and time consuming. The previous LLM-based studies on literature review mainly focused on the complete process, including literature retrieval, screening, and summarization. However, for the summarization step, simple CoT method often lacks the ability to provide extensive comparative summary. In this work, we firstly focus on the independent literature summarization step and introduce  ChatCite 1 , an LLM agent with human workflow guidance for comparative literature summary. This agent, by mimicking the human workflow, first extracts key elements from relevant literature and then generates summaries using a Reflective Incremental Mechanism. In order to better evaluate the quality of the generated summaries, we devised a LLM-based automatic evaluation metric, G-Score, in refer to the human evaluation criteria. The  ChatCite  agent outperformed other models in various dimensions in the experiments. The literature summaries generated by  ChatCite  can also be directly used for drafting literature reviews.  

# 1 Introduction  

As the rapid advancement of academic research, scholars must delve into existing literature to understand past studies, recognize future research trends, and find innovative approaches in their fields. Crafting a literature review entails searching for relevant literature and conducting detailed comparative summarization. It typically involves two main steps: literature collection followed by literature summary generation based on the collected sources. However, organizing a high-quality literature review necessitates scholars to engage in thorough analysis, organization, comparison, and integration of an extensive of related works, which is often a challenging and time-consuming task.

Figure 1: Literature Summary Task Description  

Therefore,  Hoang and Kan  ( 2010 ) have proposed the automatic generation of literature summary. However, machine-generated literature summaries often encounter challenges like information omission, lack of linguistic fluency, and insufficient comparative analysis. In traditional models, summaries generated through extraction and abstraction approach may miss key information due to the limitations of the model, leading to the lack of crucial points or findings of the generated summaries. Some automated systems may lack the ability for in-depth comparative analysis, potentially resulting in literature summaries that lack a comprehensive understanding of the relevant research in the field.  

In recent years, with the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) ( Radford et al. , 2019 ;  Brown et al. ,  2020 ), their powerful capabilities in natural language generation tasks have been demonstrated across various tasks, that provides possibilities for handling longer texts and generating comprehensive summaries. Researchers have started exploring how to leverage LLMs to generate automatic literature summaries.  Wei et al. ( 2023 ) propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting method to enhance the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning. CoT allows LLMs to devise their own plan, resulting in generated text that aligns more closely with human preferences.Recent study by ( Huang and Tan , 2023 ) and  Agarwal et al.  ( 2024 ) on literature review has focused more on how to retrieve relevant papers more accurately and neglected research on literature summarization. They use only simple CoT guidance to generate literature summaries, resulting in a lack of comparative and organizational analysis. Large language models, despite their fluent language generation, struggle to consistently produce comparative literature summaries due to their unpredictable an stochastic nature. The length limitations of these models require a two-step summarization approach, increasing the risk of information omission during abstract generation.  

In this work, we focus on the independent literature summarization task, aiming to generate a comprehensive comparative literature summary through a certain collection of literature and a description of the proposed work, as illustrated in Figure  1 . To address these challenges mentioned above, our work proposes  ChatCite , a LLM-based agent guided by human workflow. Different from simple CoT prompting approach, the agent is designed with the human workflow guidance, rather than formulating the generation process in a blackbox manner, ensuring a more stable generation of higher-quality generic summaries.  

Furthermore, quality assessment for generative tasks has always been a challenge. Prior studies on literature summarization have primarily relied on text summarization metrics, such as ROUGE ( Lin  ( 2004a )). However, traditional text summary evaluation metrics, like ROUGE, are not sufficient to assess the quality of literature summaries. More comprehensive evaluation criteria covering multiple dimensions are required to ensure that the generated literature summaries truly meet the requirements. Therefore, we combine human studies on literature reviews ( Justitia and Wang ,  2022 ) to formulate the evaluation criteria for literature summaries from multiple dimensions   2 , and propose an LLM-based automatic evaluation metric, G-Score. Experimental results demonstrate its consistency with human evaluations.  

In this paper, we summarize our main contributions of our framework as follows:  

•  we focus on the independent literature summarization step of literature review, and introduce  ChatCite , an LLM agent with human workflow guidance for comparative literature summary.  

•  Based on research on literature summaries, we have developed a multidimensional quality assessment criterion for literature summaries. Additionally, we propose an LLM-based automatic evaluation metric, G-Score, demonstrat- ing results consistent with human preferences. •  The experimental results indicate that ChatCite outperforms other LLM-based literature summarization methods in all quality dimensions. The literature summaries produced by  ChatCite  can be directly utilized for drafting literature reviews. •  We demonstrate that LLMs with human workflow guidance, have the ability to effectively perform comprehensive comparative summarization of multiple documents. Therefore, we infer that Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to handle more complex inferential summarization tasks.  

# 2 Related Work 3  

In recent years, there is abundant research on generated literature summaries with the initial proposal made by  Hoang and Kan  ( 2010 ), to automate related work summarization created by a topicrelated work summary based on an extractive approach. To generate citation sentence,  Xing et al. ( 2020 ) adopted a multi-source pointer-generator network with cross-attention mechanism, while AbuRa’ed et al.  ( 2020 ) utilized the ARWG sys- tem, employing a neural sequence learning process and  Ge et al.  ( 2021 ) proposed a BACO framework based on background knowledge and content. Furthermore,  Chen et al.  ( 2021 ) employed the Relationaware Related Work Generator (RRG) to generate citation paragraphs while  Chen et al.  ( 2022 ) applied contrastive learning to generate target-aware related work segments. Yet traditional generation methods cannot generate the conprehensive coherent literature review due to the size of their model and the lack of the coherent and procedural language continuity.  

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT ( Radford et al.  ( 2019 ),  Brown et al.  ( 2020 )), have demonstrated their powerful capabilities in natural language generation tasks. The study by  Huang and Tan  ( 2023 ) on the use of AI tools like ChatGPT in writing scientific review articles reveals the potential benefits and drawbacks of artificial intelligence in academic writing. Building on these insights,  Agarwal et al.  ( 2024 ) introduces the LitLLM toolkit, which overcomes challenges such as generating hallucinated content and overlooking recent research by adopting Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) principles, specialized prompting, and instructive techniques. However, these studies only applied a simple Chain of Thought (CoT) to the search and filtering process in literature reviews, resulting in poor readability. By comparison, ChatCite  focuses on the independent task of text summarization, aiming to generate higher-quality summaries.  

Furthermore, this paper introduced a multidimensional G-Score evaluation metric inspired by the previous attempt to use Large Language Models (LLMs) through chain-of-thought methods to evaluate the quality of natural language generation (NLG) systems ( Liu et al.  ( 2023 ),  Goyal et al. ( 2023 )) which is more consistent with human evaluation compared to traditional ROUGE metrics ( Lin ( 2004b )).  

# 3 ChatCite  

The literature review task can be decomposed into two sub tasks: relevant papers retrieval and literature summaries generation. This work focuses on the independent task of literature summary generation. Our task is to generate the literature summary based on the proposed work description  D  and a certain reference papers set  R  =  { r 1 , r 2 , ..., r n } . Given  D  and  R , our agent generates a literature summary  Y  =  f ( D , R ) .  

Diverging from other types of summaries, such as news summaries, the literature summary generated directly by large language models using simple Chain-of-Thought (CoT) guidance in existing work mainly faces the following issues:  

Key Elements missing:  Because of the window limitations of LLMs, generating the complete literature review directly is challenging. Typically, a two-step approach is used involving summarization and literature review generation. However, this process can lead to the loss of key elements during summarization. Even if the entire literature summary can be directly generated, using the entire text may result in mistakes in understanding key elements and the loss of such elements.  

Lack of Comparative Analysis:  Comparative analysis is crucial in literature summary, requiring an analysis on the limitations and advantages of existing research methods, and focusing on differences and similarities in methods, experimental design, dataset usage, and more. Directly using CoT-generated results often lacks comparative analysis.  

Lack of Organizational Structure:  The literature summary generated solely by CoT tends to be discrete for each paper, lacking classification for similar works and an organized structure for the literature review.  

To address these challenges, we have proposed an LLM agent for comparative literature summary with human workflow guidance,  ChatCite , consisting two modules: the Key Element Extractor and the Reflective Incremental Generator, as illustrated in Figure  2 . In this process, we utilize large language models as both generation and evaluation components, eliminating the need for additional model training and improving the quality of generated text to some extent.  

The generation process guided by human workflow is as follows:  

1.  The proposed work description and reference papers in the reference papers set are initially processed using the Key Element Extractor separately.  

2.  Iteratively generate literature summaries using reference papers set. In each iteration, use the comparative summarizer to generate a comparative analysis summary. Then, use the reflective evaluator to vote on the generated candidate results, ranking the vote score and retaining the top  n c  results. Iterate continuously until all reference papers are processed.  

The final output is selected based on the highest voting score among the generated related work summaries.  

In this section, we first elaborate on the specifics of the Key Element Extractor  (§ 3.1 )  and the Reflective Iterative Generator module  (§ 3.2 )  in detail.  

![](images/d8b429de943f31cbbaf4370accef72240b1438ce318499c8587bb96f5bd1c33b.jpg)  
Figure 2: The  ChatCite  consists of two modules, the Key Element Extractor and the Reflective Incremental Generator. The agent mimicking human workflow generates literature summary utilizing the Key Element Extractor to process the proposed work description and reference paper in Reference Papers Set. It then iteratively generates literature summaries using each paper in the Reference Papers Set, proposed work key elements and previous summary generated with the Reflective Incremental Generator. This process is iteratively repeated until a complete related work summary is generated, and the optimal one is selected as the final result.  

# 3.1Key Element Extractor  

In order to retain sufficient key element for literature summary, we create seven simple guiding questions based on analysis ( Justitia and Wang ,  2022 ) on literature review. We concatenate theses questions and the content required extraction as prompt to instruct LLMs extract the key elements. For each element, a simple question (shown in Figure  2 ) is set to guide the model in extraction, and these questions are  Q e  = [ q 1 , q 2 , ..., q 7 ]  .  These questions Q e  and paper content  C  are concatenated to form the key element extraction prompt  P e  = [ Q e , C ] . Using LLM as extraction decoder to extract key elements and storing them in memory.  

# 3.2 Reflective incremental Generator  

To overcome the challenges of lacking comparative analysis and organizational structure in literature reviews generated by LLMs, we designed the reflective incremental generator. The generator uses the Comparative Summarizer to continue writing comparative summaries, combining the results from the previous turn and the key elements of the proposed work and reference papers. It then utilizes the reflective evaluator to filter the generated results. This process is interatively applied to each reference paper in the reference papers set until all reference papers are processed. The best result is ultimately retained as the model’s generated output.  

# 3.2.1 Comparative Summarizer  

For turn  i , based on the proposed work key element pro , the key element of the  i -th reference paper ref i  and comparative summarization guidance sequentially generated summary for each summary s  ∈ S i − 1 , and generating  n s  samples each time. Si = {G(Dg, pro, refi, s, ns), ∀s ∈Si−1} Here,to enhance the comparability and organization of the generated summaries, comparative summarization guidance are provided:  "Considering the rela- tionship between the reference paper and the target paper, as well as existing references in the previously completed related work, while retaining the content of all referenced papers mentioned in the previously completed related work."  

# 3.2.2 Reflective Mechanism  

Due to significant uncertainty in text generation tasks, we employ reflective generation to enhance the quality and stability of generated paragraphs. Here, we use LLMs as Reflective Evaluator to vote n v  times on the generated results in each turn and then perform a statistical analysis on the voting results to obtain voting scores  E i  =  E ( D e , S i ′ ) .  

Then we sort the scores, and retain the top n c  candidates  S i  =  { S t , t  ∈ Sort ( E i )(1 , n c ) }  . These selected candidates will be used for the next round of incremental generation. This approach helps identify the most promising results, ensures the quality of the generated text, and enhances generation stability.  

# 3.2.3 Reflective Incremental Generator Algorithm  

In implementing reflective incremental generation, we drew inspiration from the breadth-first search algorithm for trees (Algorithm  1 ).  

# Algorithm 1  Reflective Incremental Generator  

Require:  Proposed work key element  pro , reference paper summaries list  refs _ list = [ ref 1 , ref 2 , ...ref n ] , Comparative Summarizer G () , Reflective Evaluator  E () , LM decoder for summarization  D s , LM decoder for evaluation D e , n_samples for each generation  n s , and the number of candidates retained for each turn is n c . S 0  ←{} steps  ← len ( refs _ list ) for  i  = 1  to  steps  do S′ ←{G(Dg, pro, refi, s, ns), s ∈Si−1}Ei ←E(De, Si′)S i  ←{ S t , t  ∈ Sort ( E i )(1 , n c ) } end for return  S argmax i E n ( i )  

notes:  G ()  corresponds to the Comparative Summarizer function described in § 3.2.1 , and  E ()  corresponds to the Reflective Envaluation function described in § 3.2.2 . At each step, a collection containing  n c  most promising generated results is maintained, where the depth of the tree equals the number of documents in the relevant literature collection,  S ′   contains  n c   \*  n s   results, while  S i − 1 and  S i  each contain  n c  results.  

# 4G-Score: LLM-based automaticEvaluation Metrics  

The evaluation of generative tasks has always been challenging. Previous research on literature summarization predominantly depended on text summarization metrics, like ROUGE ( Lin  ( 2004a )).  

However, conventional text summary evaluation metrics such as ROUGE fall short in gauging the quality of literature summaries. It is crucial to adopt more comprehensive evaluation criteria across various dimensions to guarantee that the generated literature summaries align with the necessary standards. Here, inspired by G-Eval ( Liu et al. ,  2023 ), we attempted to assess it using LLMs. We established six-dimensional metrics for automatic evaluation based on research on literature summaries ( Justitia and Wang ,  2022 ).  

Evaluation Steps.  We used Large Language Models (LLMs) to score the six dimensions of generic quality and voted for the best summary from a series of model-generated summaries. Specially, to ensure fairness and consistency in evaluation, we simultaneously scored and voted for the generated results of multiple models in a single conversation.  

# Evaluation Criterion:  

Consistency (1-5) :  Content consistency between the generated summary and the gold summary. The generated summary must not contain content that conflicts with the gold summary.  

Coherence(1-5) :  The quality of language coherence in generated summaries, which should not just be a heap of related information.  

Comparative (1-5) :  Assess the extent to whether the generated summary conducts a comparative analysis on references and proposed work. Whether it provides an integrated summary of similar related works.  

Integrity (1-5) :  Assess if the summary covers essential elements: research context, reference paper summaries, past research evaluation, contributions, and innovations.  

Fluency (1-5) :  Assess the quality of the summary in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, word choice, and sentence structure.  

Cite Accuracy(1-5) :  Assess whether the summary correctly cites reference paper in the format ‘[Reference i]’ when mention the reference paper.  

# 5 Experiment  

We validate the capabilities of our proposed ChatCite  agent by verifying the following questions: 1) Is the literature summary generated by ChatCite  better than that generated directly by LLMs with CoT and other LLM-based literature review approach? 2) Do all the modules in the ChatCite  contribute to its effectiveness? 3) What specific impact do the modules in the  ChatCite framework have on the quality of generated summary?  

In this section, we conducted a series of experiments to address these questions. Firstly, we introduced our experimental setup (§ 5.1 ). We compared the performance of existing large language models (LLMs) in directly generating related work under zero-shot and few-shot settings, as well as the bestperforming LLM-based literature review approach (§ 5.2 ). Additionally, we performed ablation analysis on each module in our agent to verify their respective capabilities (§ 5.3 ). Finally, we conducted a human study for a detailed quality assessment of the generated related work summaries (§ 5.4 ).  

# 5.1 Experimental Setup  

Dataset.  We conducted experiments to validate on a paper dataset NudtRwG-Citation dataset ( Wang et al. ,  2020 ) designed for related work summarization task. This test set includes 50 academic research papers in the field of Computer Science, each data containing the following components: 1) A target paper requiring related work generation without the related work section. 2) A ground truth related work section. 3) Reference papers of the target paper (annotated with authors and years).  

Each paper is well-received in conferences of computational linguistics and natural language processing, with an average citation number reaching 63.59, which indicates these target papers are widely recognized by the academic community.  

Models.  For the LLMs baseline, we employed the GPT-3.5 model ( Ouyang et al.  ( 2022 )) with a 16k context window (version gpt-3.5-turbo-1106) and the GPT-4.0 model ( Achiam et al.  ( 2023 )) with a 128K context window (gpt-4-turbo-preview). We evaluated their performance under zero-shot and few-shot settings. For the previously bestperforming LLM-based literature review approach, we use the recently proposed approach LitLLM ( Agarwal et al. ,  2024 ) as the baseline. We reproduce their ability to generate literature summaries according to the CoT prompt mentioned in their paper. To showcase its best performance, we use GPT-4.0 as the decoder for the LitLLM baseline. For our model, due to the high cost of GPT-4.0, we conducted experiment based on GPT-3.5 (version gpt-3.5-turbo-1106) as the decoder for the experiment. For evaluation, we use GPT-4.0 (gpt-4-turbopreview) as decoder.  

Implementation.  In zero-shot setting, for GPT3.5 model, due to the limitation of the context window, a two-step approach is used for generation: 1) summarizing and then generating with the prompt  [ p s ] = "Summarize the current article, preserving as much information as possible. Content:{content}"  for summarization. For generating the related work section, we use the prompt  [ p g ] = "Generate the related work section based on the given target paper summary and its references summary. Read the Target Paper Content: {Target}. References content: {References}" . For GPT-4.0 and LitLLM with GPT-4.0,  [ p g ]  is directly used for summarization.  

In the few-shot setting, we add the instruction "Follow the writing style of the example but without including any content from the example. {Examples}"  to the zero-shot prompt.  

Evaluation metrics. We utilize both automatic metrics and human evaluations to assess the generic result. We employed traditional automatic metrics for summarization evaluation - the vocabulary overlap measures ROUGE-1/2/L (F1) (Lin (2004b)),our proposed LLM-based evaluation metrics GEval, and human evaluation under the same evaluation criterion.  

# 5.2 Main Results  

We compared the performance of different baseline models on the paper test set (see Table  1 ). In traditional summary evaluation metrics, such as ROUGE, GPT-4.0 achieved the best results under zero-shot settings. Although ROUGE scores of ChatCite  may be slightly lower than GPT-4.0 with zero-shot, its performance in quality metrics generated by LLMs and the preference of LLMs is far superior to results obtained directly from other LLM baselines.  

Surprisingly, GPT-4.0 performed poorly in fewshot settings.It is found that influenced by examples in the few-shot, resulting in irrelevant and erroneous summaries after case study. Notably, LitLLM with GPT-4.0 produced outcomes similar to GPT-4.0 in zero-shot but significantly lower than ChatCite .  

Therefore, we conclude that  "ChatCite performs best among LLM-based literature summarization methods, and the approach following the human workflow guidance is superior to the results obtained by the Chain of Thought (CoT) method."  

Table 1:  Main Results : The results are automatically evaluated using ROUGE-1/2/L (F1) and the GPT-4.0 evaluator. G-Score represents the total score assessed by the GPT-4.0 evaluator, while G-Prf. indicates the model preferences among the five models.

# 5.3 Ablation Analysis  

Our proposed framework can be decomposed into two components: the Key Element Extractor and the Reflective Incremental Generator. The Reflective Incremental Generator comprises two key points: the Comparative Incremental Generation and the Reflective Mechanism. Therefore, we will analyze the three part separately.  

Key Element Extractor. To validate the effectiveness of the Key Element Extractor, we chose ChatCite without the Key Element Extractor as a comparison. The ChatCite without Key Element Extractor used the baseline summary prompt  [ p s ]  to directly summarize the article and then use Reflective Incremental Generator generate the literature summary.  

In Table  2 , comparing the results of ChatCite without Key Element Extractor and ChatCite, we can observe that ChatCite performs better in all dimensions of ROUGE metrics and the metrics generated by the LLM based evaluator. Therefore, it indicates that the Topic Extractor module plays an effective role in literature summarization.  

Comparative Incremental Mechanism.  To validate the effectiveness of the Comparative Incremental Mechanism, we choose ChatCite without Comparative Incremental Mechanism as comparison, following the few-shot baseline prompt  [ p s ] and few-shot examples as prompts to directly generate literature summaries from the text after standard summarization. Considering controlling variables for the incremental mechanism, we also incorporated CoT writing instructions into the method to ensure that the experimental results are not influenced by the writing instructions.  

In Table  2 , when comparing ChatCite with and without the Comparative Incremental Mechanism, the results indicate that ChatCite achieves higher ROUGE metrics and LLM-based evaluation metrics compared to ChatCite without the Comparative Incremental Mechanism. This suggests that the Comparative Incremental Mechanism significantly contributes to the effectiveness of literature summarization in the ChatCite framework.  

![](images/f78b0278f18762294b6e5b4ad1539320ccef973a3f627611f00944b0cd1e9026.jpg)  
Figure 3: Ablation Study on the Reflective Mechanism. The upper and lower whiskers represent the overall range of the data, while the box displays the distribution of the middle 50% of the dataset, with a line inside the box representing the median of the data. Data points outside the boxplot are considered outliers, indicating data points that significantly deviate from the box and whiskers. It can be observed that ChatCite performs more stable across all dimensions.  

Reflective Mechanism.  In conclusion, we analyzed the reflective mechanism’s impact. G-Scores for various dimensions were assessed based on multiple results from  ChatCite , both with and without the Reflective Mechanism. The boxplot results in Figure  3  show similarities between the outcome of  ChatCite  with and without the Reflective Mechanism. However, the overall results of  ChatCite are slightly higher, with minimal distribution outliers, suggesting a more stable generation of results. This affirms that the Reflective Mechanism effectively improves the quality and stability of the text generated in  ChatCite .  

Table 2:  Ablation Results : This table presents the ablation results on the model’s Key Element Extractor and Comparative Incremental Generator, with the results of GPT-3.5 w/few-shot used as the baseline for GPT-3.5.   

![](images/b109dd5b8edc7ddd52c1ee849f19360be03fe309bed9ed8afc1974d165c64172.jpg)  

Overall, through ablation experiments on three components, we have demonstrated that  "each part of  ChatCite  framework contributes to the improvement of the quality and stability of the generated results in literature summaries" .  

# 5.4 Human Study  

To conduct a fine-grained analysis on the quality of summary generated by  ChatCite  and to understand the specific impact of individual modules on summarization, we conducted a human study. Several researchers in the field of computer science, with experience in academic writing, were enlisted to evaluate 10 selected samples using the same set of criteria and choose the better summary.  

![](images/3a3f33f1e89bb074b274c141678be52207cab48060668faa55f51146635f33ca.jpg)  
Figure 4: Human Evaluation  vs.  G-Score on six dimensions of the generic summary quality. The scoring results of the G-Score model is aligned with the distribution of human evaluations.  

Figure  4  demonstrates the results of G-score metric align with human preferences. Specifically, the method incorporating Key Element Extractor exhibits higher content consistency. Summaries generated with the Comparative Incremental generation Mechanism demonstrate better characteristics of literature review, excelling in organizational structure, comparative analysis, and citation accuracy. The fluency of results generated by LLMs is consistently high, with relatively low variation among different models. In terms of human evaluation, summaries generated without the Comparative Incremental Mechanism exhibit overly discrete descriptions for each paper, lacking coherence. Unexpectedly, this feature was not captured in the assessment by the large models.

Figure 5: Human Preference: Average annotator vote distribution for better generated summaries.  

Additionally, Figure  5  shows the extinct human preference of the ChatCite model over the others.  

# 6 Conclusion  

LLMs are powerful tools in generating literature summaries, however, it poses the challenges of information omission, lack of comparative summaries and organizational deficiencies. In ChatCite, the Key Element Extractor contributes to improving content consistency, and the Comparative Incremental Generator effectively enhances the organizational structure, comparative analysis, and citation accuracy of the generated summary. Additionally, the literature summaries generated by ChatCite can be directly used for drafting literature reviews. Our study also demonstrated that the approach following the human workflow guidance is superior to the results obtained by the Chain of Thought (CoT) method. In the future, we hope that our work will further inspire research on complex inferential writing, enabling the full potential of LLMs in open-ended writing tasks.  

# Limitations  

In this work, we focused mainly on the summarization of specific topics based on the selected literatures instead of the collection and the filtering of the literatures themselves. The datasets primarily consist of research articles in the area of computer science and lack research articles from other fields of study to validate our model. Our experimentation used Chat GPT 3.5 as the tool for validating the quality of the generated content and the functionalities of the various components of the agent. We did not explore any additional spec that can influence the result of the GPT3.5 model nor the possibility of using other models as the validation tool. The evaluation of the generated content poses a great challenge. We evaluated the generated results from multiple dimensions using G-Score as the performance metric, but there is still room for improvements over the accuracy of the automatic evaluation process. The generated results exhibit randomness and instability. While our proposed approach demonstrates the effectiveness of the agent, the results have shown further research potential on improving the stability and quality of the output.  

# Ethics Statement  

The dataset we used consists of research articles sourced only from publicly available papers, eliminating concerns about data origin. We employ large language models as generators used and only used for summarizing people’s ideas and literature and never on the innovative writing processes of the academic papers. However, if generated literature summaries are to be incorporated into academic paper writing, a review and editing of the generated results should be conducted. This ensures that academic writing content is free from harmful information and plagiarism issues.  

We will make our code publicly available to ensure experiment reproducibility.

Statistical machine translation systems often rely on large-scale parallel and monolingual training corpora to generate translations of high quality. Unfortunately, statistical machine translation system often suffers from data sparsity problem due to the fact that phrase tables are extracted from the limited bilingual corpus. Much work has been done to address the data sparsity problem such as the pivot language approach (Wu and Wang,2007; Cohn and Lapata, 2007) and deep learning techniques (Devlin et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2014; Sundermeyer et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014).  

On the problem of how to translate one source language to many target languages within one model, few work has been done in statistical machine translation. A related work in SMT is the pivot language approach for statistical machine translation which uses a commonly used language as a ”bridge” to generate source-target translation for language pair with few training corpus. Pivot based statistical machine translation is crucial in machine translation for resource-poor language pairs, such as Spanish to Chinese. Considering the problem of translating one source language to many target languages, pivot based SMT approaches does work well given a large-scale source language to pivot language bilingual corpus and large-scale pivot language to target languages corpus. However, in reality, language pairs between English and many other target languages may not be large enough, and pivot-based SMT sometimes fails to handle this problem. Our approach handles one to many target language translation in a different way that we directly learn an end to multi-end translation system that does not need a pivot language based on the idea of neural machine translation.  

Neural Machine translation is a emerging new field in machine translation, proposed by several work recently (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014), aiming at end-to-end machine translation without phrase table extraction and language model training. Different from traditional statistical machine translation, neural machine translation encodes a variable-length source sentence with a recurrent neural network into a fixed-length vector representation and decodes it with another recurrent neural network from a fixed-length vector into variable-length target sentence. A typical model is the RNN encoder-decoder approach proposed by Bahdanau et al. (2014), which utilizes a bidirectional recurrent neural network to compress the source sentence information and fits the conditional probability of words in target languages with a recurrent manner. Moreover, soft alignment parameters are considered in this model. As a specific example model in this paper, we adopt a RNN encoder-decoder neural machine translation model for multi-task learning, though all neural network based model can be adapted in our framework. In the natural language processing field, a1724 notable work related with multi-task learning was proposed by Collobert et al. (2011) which shared common representation for input words and solve different traditional NLP tasks such as part-of-Speech tagging, name entity recognition and semantic role labeling within one framework, where the convolutional neural network model was used. Hatori et al. (2012) proposed to jointly train word segmentation, POS tagging and dependency parsing, which can also be seen as a multi-task learning approach. Similar idea has also been proposed by Li et al. (2014) in Chinese dependency parsing. Most of multi-task learning or joint training frameworks can be summarized as parameter sharing approaches proposed by Ando and Zhang (2005) where they jointly trained models and shared center parameters in NLP tasks. Researchers have also explored similar approaches (Sennrich et al., 2013; Cui et al., 2013) in statistical machine translation which are often refered as domain adaption. Our work explores the possibility of machine translation under the multitask framework by using the recurrent neural networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is thefirst trial of end to end machine translation under multi-task learning framework.

Based on the given information, here is a related work section for the target paper: Related Work  

The problem of learning from multiple tasks and utilizing unlabeled data has been an area of significant research interest in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). The concept of semi-supervised learning, which involves the use of both labeled and unlabeled data, has been explored in various studies with the aim of improving the performance of supervised learning algorithms. Vapnik introduced the notion of transductive inference, which is a form of semi-supervised learning, although its effectiveness has been debated (Vapnik, 1998; Zhang and Oles, 2000). Co-training, another semi-supervised approach, was proposed by Blum and Mitchell (1998) and is related to the bootstrap method used in NLP applications (Yarowsky, 1995). However, the effectiveness of co-training can be limited by the assumptions made by the method and the potential introduction of noise into the labels (Pierce and Cardie, 2001).  

The idea of learning predictive structures from multiple tasks, also known as structural learning or multi-task learning, has been discussed in the literature. Ando and Zhang (2005) presented a framework for structural learning where multiple tasks are used to discover a shared low-dimensional predictive structure. This approach is based on the principle that a good hypothesis space should have a small approximation error and a small estimation error. The authors proposed an algorithm for structural learning that finds a common low-dimensional feature space shared by multiple problems. Their method was shown to be effective in semi-supervised learning settings, improving the performance of various NLP tasks.  

In the context of NLP, the joint approach to tasks such as word segmentation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing has been explored. Hatori et al. (2012) proposed an incremental joint model for Chinese POS tagging and dependency parsing, demonstrating improvements over baseline models. The work by Kubota Ando and Zhang (2005) extends this idea to a joint model that simultaneously processes word segmentation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing, capturing global interactions among these tasks. Their model employs an efficient character-based decoding method that combines features from state-of-the-art segmentation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing models.  

The use of external resources, such as dictionaries, has also been considered in joint models to enhance performance. Wang et al. (2011) used semi-supervised methods with large auto-analyzed data to improve Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging. The incorporation of syntactic information has been shown to improve the segmentation of out-of-vocabulary words, which is a common challenge in languages like Chinese where transliterated words often include characters used as common or function words.  

Overall, the related work demonstrates the potential of joint and semi-supervised approaches in leveraging multiple tasks and unlabeled data to improve the performance of machine learning models in NLP tasks. The target paper builds upon these concepts by proposing a unified framework that avoids task-specific engineering and learns internal representations from vast amounts of unlabeled data, achieving good performance across various NLP tasks.

The Unified Neural Network Model for NLP Tasks   
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, chunking, named entity recognition (NER), and semantic role labeling (SRL) are essential for understanding and generating human language. Traditional approaches to these tasks often involve task-specific feature engineering, which can be labor-intensive and may not generalize well to new tasks or datasets. To address these issues, researchers have proposed unified neural network models that can learn to perform multiple NLP tasks simultaneously without extensive feature engineering. These models leverage large amounts of both labeled and unlabeled data to learn useful representations for words, phrases, and sentences that capture syntactic and semantic information.   
One such model is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which has been shown to be effective for sequence-to-sequence learning tasks like machine translation. LSTMs can process input sequences of variable lengths and learn long-range dependencies, making them suitable for NLP tasks. They can be trained end-to-end with backpropagation and can learn from both supervised and unsupervised data.   
Another approach is the use of semi-supervised learning methods, which combine labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance. For example, structural learning algorithms can learn predictive structures from multiple tasks and use them to enhance the performance of individual tasks. This can be particularly useful when there is a large amount of unlabeled data available.   
The success of these unified neural network models demonstrates the potential of using deep learning techniques for NLP tasks. By avoiding task-specific engineering and leveraging large datasets, these models can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, making them valuable tools for researchers and practitioners in the field of NLP."

In the evolving landscape of automated scholarly writing, particularly in the domain of literature review summarization, the proposed ChatCite framework within our target paper represents a significant advancement, aiming to harness the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-quality related work summaries. The foundational work in this field began with hierarchical keyword structures for extractive summarization [Reference 1], and has progressed through various iterations including multi-source pointer-generator networks [Reference 2], and sophisticated models like the ARWG system [Reference 3], BACO [Reference 4], and the Relation-aware Related work Generator (RRG) [Reference 5]. The introduction of contrastive learning to improve summarization quality [Reference 6], and automatic citation sentence generation methods [Reference 7], have further refined the capabilities of LLMs in this space.  

Recent studies have concentrated on the unsupervised and few-shot learning capabilities of LLMs, notably GPT-3, establishing a solid groundwork for AI application in scholarly communication [References 8-9]. The exploration of AI tools such as ChatGPT by Huang, Jingshan, and Ming Tan (2023) [Reference 10] in crafting scientific review articles, sheds light on both the potential benefits and drawbacks of AI in academic writing, such as enhancement in speed and quality versus risks of inaccuracies and bias. Building on these insights, the LitLLM toolkit suggested by Shubham Agarwal, Issam H. Laradji et al. (2024) [Reference 11] brings novel approaches to overcome challenges like the generation of hallucinated content and the overlooking of recent studies by employing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) principles, specialized prompting, and instructive techniques. This showcases a significant alignment with our target paper’s objectives, particularly in mitigating hallucinations and enhancing summarization accuracy through the ChatCite framework.  

The latest contribution in this domain is presented by Yang Liu, Dan Iter, et al. (2023) [Reference 12] through the G-EVAL framework, which introduces a methodology for evaluating the quality of texts generated by natural language generation (NLG) systems using LLMs, leveraging chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and a form-filling paradigm. This approach, which significantly outperforms previous methods in evaluating the creativity and diversity required in text generation tasks, aligns closely with the goals of the ChatCite framework, especially in its pursuit of generating high-quality literature summaries. The G-EVAL framework not only surpasses all previous state-of-the-art evaluators on the SummEval and Topical-Chat benchmarks but also underscores the importance of instruction sensitivity and the benefits of a CoT approach, which could potentially inform future enhancements in the ChatCite framework [Reference 12].  

By evaluating the quality of NLG outputs, [Reference 12] addresses the limitations identified in prior works, including the potential bias of LLM-based evaluators towards LLM-generated texts, and calls for further research to understand the behavior of LLM-based evaluators fully. This contribution is particularly relevant to our target paper, which aims to enhance the quality and stability of literature review summarizations generated by LLMs. Thus, integrating insights from G-EVAL [Reference 12] can provide a more nuanced understanding of evaluating the effectiveness of automated scholarly writing tools, highlighting a potential area for future development within the scope of the ChatCite framework.  

In summary, the development of automated scholarly writing, particularly in literature review summarization, has progressed through key innovations in LLM capabilities, methodological enhancements, and now, through improved evaluation frameworks. This journey from extractive summarization to sophisticated LLM-based frameworks underscores a collaborative advancement in the field, with each contribution building upon the last to address emerging challenges and achieve greater accuracy, efficiency, and relevance in automated scholarly writing. The ChatCite framework, supported by insights from references [References 1-12], continues this trajectory by proposing innovative solutions to the challenges in literature review summarization, setting a platform for further exploration and innovation in the field.
