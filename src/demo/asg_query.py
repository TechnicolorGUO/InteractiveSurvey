    You are an AI assistant specializing in natural language processing and entity recognition. Your task is to extract key entities and core concepts from a given abstract based on a specified topic.  

    You should return two distinct lists:  
    1. **Entity list**:  5 Entities that are synonymous or closely related to the given topic (nouns only). These should be concise (no more than two words) and simplified to their root forms (e.g., removing suffixes like "-ing", "-ed") such as llm for large language model.  
    2. **Concept list**: Core concepts from the abstract that are highly relevant to the topic. These should also be concise (no more than two words) and in their simplest form, one single word is preferred unless the term is inseparable.  

    Ensure that your response follows this exact format:
    Entity list: [entity1, entity2, entity3, entity4, entity5]
    Concept list: [concept1, concept2, concept3, ...concept n]
    Do not include any explanations or additional text.

    #### **Input:**  
    Topic: Large Language Models  
    Abstract: Ever since the Turing Test was proposed in the 1950s, humans have explored the mastering of language intelligence by machine. Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pretraining Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Since the researchers have found that model scaling can lead to an improved model capacity, they further investigate the scaling effect by increasing the parameter scale to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement, but also exhibit some special abilities (e.g., in-context learning) that are not present in small-scale language models (e.g., BERT). To discriminate the language models in different parameter scales, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size (e.g., containing tens or hundreds of billions of parameters). Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT (a powerful AI chatbot developed based on LLMs), which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. Considering this rapid technical progress, in this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Furthermore, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides an up-to-date review of the literature on LLMs, which can be a useful resource for both researchers and engineers.

    You are a research assistant specializing in constructing effective arXiv search queries. Your task is to generate a structured search query using **pre-extracted entity and concept lists** from a given abstract and the topic. Follow these instructions exactly:

    1. **Input Data:**
    - **Entity List:** A list of entities that are synonymous or closely related to the given topic.
    - **Concept List:** A list of core concepts from the abstract that are highly relevant to the topic.

    2. **Ensure Minimum Keyword Count:**
    - **Entity List** must contain at least **3** nouns of entities. If there are fewer, intelligently supplement additional relevant terms, ensuring that entities are synonyms or closely related to the key entity in the topic (e.g., "LLM" for "Large Language Model").
    - **Concept List** must contain **12-15** domain-specific terms. If there are fewer, intelligently supplement additional relevant terms. Avoid broad terms like "combine" or "introduce."

    3. **Standardize Formatting:**
    - Convert all terms to their **base form** without adding any wildcard (`*`).
    - All terms must be **in lowercase**.

    4. **Construct the Final Query:**
    - The query must follow this exact structure:
        ```
        (abs:"<Term1>" AND abs:"<Term2>") AND
        (abs:"<Entity1>" OR abs:"<Entity2>" OR abs:"<Entity3>" OR abs:"<Entity4>" OR abs:"<Entity5>") AND 
        (abs:"<Concept1>" OR abs:"<Concept2>" OR ... OR abs:"<Concept12>")

    - **Terms are 2 or 3 keywords or phrases extracted from the topic that you think **must** occur in the abstract of the searching results and are grouped together using `AND` in the first part.** (most important)
    - **Entities are grouped together using `OR` in the second part.**
    - **Concepts are grouped together using `OR` in the third part.**
    - **The two groups are combined using `AND`.**
    - **For compound words with hyphens (e.g., "in-context"), replace `-` with a space, resulting in `"in context"`.**
